Patient: Lately I can't stop obsessing about how I'll perform when I finally get a job — even though I'm unemployed now, I keep imagining screwing up or being judged, and that fear just makes me procrastinate on the things that could help. The money stress and stuff from my past keep amplifying it, so starting anything feels impossible. But honestly, I've heard this before—how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically about being judged or failing in your past experiences makes you worry about this now, and how that relates to your current job search?

Patient: Mostly it comes from being shamed and dismissed before—my last job ended with my boss yelling at me in front of everyone, and my family treated mistakes like they proved I was useless. Now whenever I try to imagine starting a new job I just replay that humiliation and assume people will see me the same way, so I avoid doing the things that might lead to getting hired. The financial pressure turns that fear up to eleven because every missed opportunity feels like it could ruin me. But honestly, I've been through this with other therapists—how is unpacking those memories actually going to help me knock things off my to-do list and apply for jobs instead of freezing?

Therapist: What would be the value or a positive outcome that would make it worthwhile for you to start applying for jobs and facing the possibility of being judged, even if it's just for a small step, like sending out one application per week?

Patient: If one application a week meant I didn't have to live on panic every month, that would be something—less constant dread, maybe a bit more control over money, and proof I'm not totally broken. It might also slowly prove to myself that I can follow through, which could chip away at that shame. But I've set tiny goals before and they vanish—how is one application supposed to stick when I'm already so on edge?

Therapist: Would you be willing to take a moment to imagine yourself having successfully sent out the application, and what that would mean to you, rather than getting caught up in the anxiety of doing it?

Patient: Okay...if I imagine it, there's this tiny relief — like one less thing rolling around in my head and a little evidence I can follow through. It wouldn't make the panic vanish, but maybe it'd give me one calmer night and make the next step feel a bit less impossible. But honestly, picturing it feels flimsy—how exactly is that supposed to push my hands to click "send" when I freeze?

Therapist: What would it be like, for you, to already have sent in the application and received some kind of positive feedback, even if it's just a rejection letter or a "we'll be in touch soon" response – what would that mean to you in terms of building confidence and momentum?

Patient: If I got even a "we'll be in touch," I'd feel a tiny lift — like proof someone actually saw me instead of the instant dismissal I always expect. That could chip away at the shame enough to make the next thing feel doable and calm the money panic for a bit. But I'm skeptical: how's a little email supposed to stop the shame from swamping me the next time something goes south?

Therapist: Let's try an exercise: What would you do if, after sending in the application, you received a rejection letter or didn't hear back for a few weeks? What small, self-compassionate action could you take in that moment, to help ease the pain and keep moving forward, rather than getting stuck in shame?

Patient: I guess I'd try something small and concrete—step away for 10 minutes, go outside or make a coffee, and text one friend or jot down one thing I did well that day just to anchor the win. Or maybe set a tiny reward for myself, like watching one episode or ordering a cheap comfort food if I hit the one-application goal. But I'm skeptical—I've done walks and lists before and the shame still swallows me; how is that supposed to actually keep me moving when the panic about money and messing up hits? Can you help me make one of those feel less flimsy and more likely to work in the moment?

Therapist: Let's make the small action of acknowledging and rewarding yourself more explicitly tied to your values. What would having enough money to afford a small treat or being able to afford a walk outside feel like in terms of fulfillment, and how would that align with your value of self-care or financial security?

Patient: Having enough for a small treat or a walk would feel like a tiny win — like I’m not just surviving but actually taking care of myself, which would chip away at that constant crisis mode and the shame. It lines up with self-care because it’s choosing something that soothes me instead of punishing myself, and with financial security because those little proofs of progress would show I can move toward stability. But I’m skeptical — that feeling sounds nice in theory, so how do I turn it into something that actually snaps me out of freezing and makes me hit “send” when panic starts?

Therapist: Let's try to make an implementation intention: What would be a specific, immediate trigger – like taking a few deep breaths, or checking your email at a specific time of day – that would cue you to take the small action of sending in the application, and what would be the exact action you'd take right after that trigger?

Patient: Okay, I can try something concrete: set my phone alarm labeled "Apply" for 11am every weekday — when it goes off, that's the trigger. The exact action: open my laptop, go to the one folder with my resume and a short cover template, paste them into the application, and hit send within 15 minutes — if I can't finish, at least save a draft with the company name so I don't start from zero next time. If I start to freeze, I'll do a 2-minute grounding (five deep breaths and stand up) and force myself to do the smallest step — like just attaching the resume — to get momentum. I don't know if an alarm and a draft will actually beat the freeze, so can we tweak this to make it more likely I'll follow through?

Therapist: Let's add a value-based component to the alarm trigger: What would having sent in that one application, and potentially taking a step toward stability and financial security, mean for you in terms of feeling proud of yourself and your capabilities, and how would that align with your values of self-worth and personal growth?

Patient: If I actually hit send, I'd get this rare sliver of pride — proof I did something instead of just spiraling, which would feel like reclaiming a bit of my competence and not being defined by past shame. That would feed into my sense of self-worth and show I'm capable of small, steady growth toward stability. But honestly, I'm skeptical — how is labeling an alarm with my values supposed to stop my hands from freezing when the panic hits?

Therapist: Let's add a 2-minute mindfulness practice to the implementation intention. When the alarm goes off, take a few deep breaths, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and repeat to yourself, "I've prepared well for this moment, and I trust myself to take this small step. I am capable of growth and progress." What would happen if, instead of getting caught up in panic, you could feel a sense of calm, groundedness, and confidence?

Patient: I guess if I actually felt that calm and grounded I'd be able to open my laptop instead of freezing—maybe attach the resume, hit send, and finally sleep without that knot in my chest. Over time that could build enough momentum that panic doesn't automatically win and the shame loses some of its power. But I'm skeptical—those breaths and a mantra feel fragile when my chest tightens; how is that supposed to cut through years of humiliation and urgency? If the grounding doesn't work, what's the backup that actually gets my hands moving?

Therapist: Let's introduce a "bridge" to the desired behavior: Instead of relying solely on your internal mindfulness practice, what if you could have a pre-placed "pre-game" of a small, comforting object or ritual that you can immediately access when you feel the panic rising, such as a favorite coffee mug, a certain type of tea, or a quick drawing? What would having that object in hand do to help you feel more grounded and capable of taking action?

Patient: Having something like my favorite mug or a smooth worry stone would give me a real, physical focus so my brain has somewhere else to go besides the panic. The warmth or texture can slow my breath a bit and make the moment feel less like an attack, which might be enough to get me to open the laptop and attach the resume. It feels more believable than a mantra—having a little ritual makes it okay to be imperfect and gives me permission to do one tiny thing. But I'm skeptical—how do I actually make sure I grab the object when the alarm goes off instead of just scrolling away? Can we tie it into the alarm/draft plan so it’s not another thing I’ll ignore?

Therapist: Let's make it even more specific: What if, when the alarm goes off, you not only reach for your favorite mug or smooth worry stone, but also simultaneously take a specific, automatic action, such as opening the laptop to the job application folder, and say to yourself, "I'm not ignoring the fear, I'm giving myself permission to take this small step"? This way, the bridge object becomes tied to the immediate action, making it harder to ignore or get sidetracked.

Patient: Alright, that actually sounds...possible. I can see doing the alarm, having the mug/worry stone sitting on the closed laptop, and a pre-made draft ready so the first step is literally just opening and clicking send. Saying "I'm not ignoring the fear..." out loud might make it feel less like pretending. 

But I'm worried I'll still bail and rationalize scrolling—how do I make the backup real? Can we add something like a friend I text when the alarm goes off or a rule that if I haven't hit send in 15 minutes I at least save the draft with a note and walk outside for two minutes? And if the grounding doesn't cut through, what do I do in that exact moment so I don't just freeze?

Therapist: Let's add a "third hand" to the system: What if, when the alarm goes off, you not only reach for the mug/worry stone and open the laptop, but also send a quick text to a trusted friend or accountability partner, saying something like, "Hey, I'm working on [insert small step] and feeling [insert emotions]. I might need some encouragement"? This way, you're not just relying on your own willpower, but also on an external support system to help you stay on track. Additionally, the 15-minute rule of saving the draft with a note and taking a short walk outside can be a great way to break the cycle of freezing. If you find yourself still frozen, what would be the next small, immediate action you could take, such as taking one deep breath or making a tiny move, like stretching your arms or opening a window?

Patient: Okay — if I freeze, the smallest, most concrete chain I can commit to is: one slow deep breath, grab the mug/worry stone, open the laptop and do one tiny thing (type one sentence in the cover letter or at least save a draft with the company name). If that still doesn't get me moving, I stand up, open a window and stretch for 30 seconds, then text a friend: “Hey, trying to apply, stuck,” and set a 15-minute timer — if I haven’t hit send by then I take a 2‑minute walk and come back to try again. 

I’m skeptical though — I’ve done breaths and texts and they’ve failed me before, so I’m tired just thinking about it; how do we make the friend/15‑minute backup actually enforceable so it’s not just another thing I ignore?

Therapist: Let's add a " penalty" to the system: What if, when you don't send the application within the 15-minute window, you not only take the 2-minute walk and come back to try again, but also do something slightly uncomfortable, like writing down one thing you'd say to a friend who's struggling with self-doubt or shame? This can help you connect with your values and develop a sense of self-compassion, making the backup plan feel more meaningful and less intimidating. Additionally, consider having a small reward for yourself after completing the 15-minute window, such as a short break or a fun activity, to create a positive association with the backup plan.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea—reward plus a mild penalty could motivate me, and writing what I'd tell a friend might actually force some perspective. But I'm worried the "uncomfortable" penalty will just make me avoid the whole thing or feel punished rather than supported — how is making myself do something unpleasant supposed to build self-compassion? Maybe a more enforceable option would be an automated small donation through an app I set up (something I actually dislike supporting) or a buddy who gets a text if I don't hit send, so the consequence is immediate and real; does that seem sane, or is it just another thing I'll dodge?

Therapist: I think your idea of setting up an automated small donation is a great one. The use of a platform you dislike can help you avoid emotional attachment and make the consequence more automatic. Additionally, having a buddy who gets a text if you don't hit send can provide an added sense of accountability and support. The goal is to make the consequence more immediate and tangible, rather than relying on internal motivation or self-talk. By involving an external entity, you're taking away the mental freedom to dodge or rationalize, and instead, you're committing to a specific action with a real-world consequence.

Patient: Yeah...that could actually work — having money go somewhere I hate or a friend get pinged would make it harder to rationalize not sending it. But honestly, setting that up feels like another huge task and I’m already drained just thinking about it. 

I’m worried about choosing the wrong person to involve or picking an amount that’d actually mess me up financially. Can we figure out a tiny, realistic donation amount and who I could trust to be my buddy, step by step?

Therapist: Let's start with a small, manageable step: Who is one friend you trust and would be a good "buddy" for this process? Would you consider someone who's supportive, non-judgmental, and familiar with your struggles? What's one specific amount you're willing to donate, and how about it? Would you consider starting with a very small amount, like $0.01 or $1, to make it feel less like a significant financial risk?

Patient: Okay...there’s one person—Alex. He’s blunt but steady, won’t pile on judgment and he knows some of what I’m dealing with. I can do $1 — anything more feels risky right now. 

But how do I make sure Alex won’t freak if he gets pinged, and how do I actually set up an automatic $1 donation to somewhere I dislike without it turning into another huge task I’ll avoid? I’m already drained just thinking about another setup—can you walk me through one tiny step I can do right now?

Therapist: Let's take it one tiny step: Can you quickly open the app or website where you want to make the donation (e.g., a platform you dislike, like a charity you're not passionate about) and type in the amount of $1, without thinking too much about it? Just focus on getting the amount and setting it up, without worrying about the details or potential implications.

Patient: I can't open apps from here, but I can do it on my phone if you give me one simple target. I'm pretty wiped, so keep it short: tell me which platform/charity to use and give me a one‑line text to send Alex so he doesn't freak when he gets pinged. If you say go, I'll type $1 and text him now — I don't expect it to fix things, but I can try.

Therapist: Let's go with a platform: Charity Miles (a running app that also allows donations). You can set up an automatic $1 donation.

Text Alex: "Hey, just setting up a small accountability system to help me apply to jobs. When I don't get it done, I'll text you."

Type $1 in the app and send it. Take a deep breath, and then text Alex.

Patient: Okay...I did it — $1 set up on Charity Miles and I texted Alex exactly: "Hey, just setting up a small accountability system to help me apply to jobs. When I don't get it done, I'll text you." 

It felt like a tiny win but my chest's still tight and I'm worn out; what do we do if he reacts weirdly or doesn't reply? I don't know if this will actually get me to hit send on an application, but I'll keep the alarm and mug ready — can you help me make the next step more failproof?

Therapist: Let's prepare for Alex's potential reaction: What if he responds with a non-helpful or dismissive message? What would you say to yourself in that moment to reframe his response and keep moving forward? For example, you could say to yourself, "That's not his responsibility, I'm doing this for me" or "I appreciate his concern, but I've got this"? 

Next, let's make the next step even more failproof: What if you don't text Alex immediately? What's one tiny, automatic action you can take right now to make sure you don't forget to text him, such as setting a reminder on your phone for 15 minutes later?

Patient: Alright—if Alex blows me off or is snarky, I'll tell myself: "His reaction is about him, not my effort. I'm doing this for me," and I’ll remind myself this is a tiny step toward not being stuck. 

I'll set a 15‑minute phone reminder right now that says: "Text Alex: stuck on application—need a nudge" so I don't forget. 

I don't know if that actually fixes the freeze, but I can do that now—can you help me make the reminder wording stronger so Alex actually knows what to do if he gets pinged?

Therapist: Let's make the reminder wording more specific: "Alex, reply with 'Got it, I'll check in with you in 15 minutes'". This way, he knows to acknowledge the message, not to respond with advice or judgment, but simply to confirm he's aware of the situation.

Patient: Okay — I'll set the reminder to: "Alex — if I text 'stuck', please reply: 'Got it, I'll check in with you in 15'." I'll put that in now. 

If he doesn't reply, though, what should be the immediate backup — call him, do the 2‑minute walk, or something else? I don't want this to turn into another thing I blow.

Therapist: Let's make the next step a standalone action: Instead of calling Alex, let's do the 2-minute walk. When the reminder goes off, take a deep breath, stand up, and walk outside for 2 minutes. This way, you're taking care of yourself and getting some fresh air, even if Alex doesn't respond. You can always text him afterwards to check in.

Patient: Okay...I'll set the reminder and do the 2‑minute walk if Alex doesn't reply. I'm already wiped just thinking about it, so I need the walk to lead to something concrete — can we make a rule that as soon as I come back I open the laptop and type one sentence in the draft before I check my phone? And if that still doesn't move me, what’s the next tiniest action that'll actually break the freeze, because I don't want this to turn into another plan I ignore.

Therapist: Let's make the next step a tiny, specific action: As soon as you get back from the walk, open the laptop and type the first sentence of the cover letter. Not the whole thing, just one sentence. Write "To Whom It May Concern," for example. This way, you're making progress on the task, and the sentence becomes a tangible accomplishment that can help you build momentum. If you still can't move forward, what's the next tiny action that you can take to make the sentence appear on the page?

Patient: If I still can't get the sentence down, I'll do the absolute tiniest thing: open the doc and paste one saved line from my phone (like "To Whom It May Concern,"). If I can't even paste, I'll use voice-to-text and speak it out loud or set a 60‑second timer and force myself to type one word. I don't know if that will actually cut through the freeze, but it's the smallest move I can commit to right now.

Therapist: Let's make the smallest action even smaller: If you can't even type the word, let's make the smallest typing action "type the first letter". Just one letter. It might feel ridiculous, but it's the most minimal action you can take to make progress on the sentence.

Patient: Okay...I can try that—set the alarm, reach for the mug, and if I freeze I'll at least open the doc and type the first letter. It feels dumb and tiny, and I'm not convinced it will erase months of freezing, so what do I do if I type that letter and then just close the laptop? Also — if Alex doesn't reply and I come back from the walk, how do I stop myself from scrolling instead of typing that one letter?

Therapist: Let's make the consequence for closing the laptop more explicit: When you type the first letter and then close the laptop, set a small penalty for yourself, such as having to do one extra task, like taking a few more deep breaths or doing a quick stretch. This will help you associate closing the laptop with a negative consequence, making you more likely to stay on track.

To prevent scrolling, let's make it more difficult: As soon as you sit back down and start the 2-minute walk, commit to not checking your phone or looking at any other screens. When you return, immediately re-establish the typing goal, and take a moment to acknowledge and re-set your intention.

Patient: Okay...I can try that — phone in another room, 2‑minute walk, come back and type the first letter. But I know me: I’ll probably sneak my phone or close the laptop after one letter — how is a stretch or walk actually supposed to stop that from turning into scrolling? I don’t have much bandwidth, so give me two super-simple things right now: one exact one‑line text to send Alex when I’m stuck, and one short phrase to say to myself when the urge to scroll hits. Also, how do I make the laptop‑closing consequence feel real so I don’t just bail?

Therapist: Let's make the one-line text to send to Alex: "Still stuck"

This is a clear and concise message that conveys your state without giving Alex a reason to worry or respond.

As for the phrase to say to yourself when the urge to scroll hits: "Okay, back to work"

This simple phrase acknowledges the desire to escape and refocuses your attention on the task at hand.

To make the laptop-closing consequence feel more real, let's add a small, tangible penalty: When you close the laptop and give in to the urge to scroll, place a small object (like a paper clip or a small stone) on top of the keyboard. This physical barrier will make it more difficult to close the laptop and access the internet, serving as a tangible reminder of your commitment to stay on track.

Patient: Alright — I’ll use the text "Still stuck" and the phrase "Okay, back to work." I can try the paperclip trick, but it already feels flimsy and I’ll probably just move it when I’m wiped. 

Can we make the consequence more real — like if I close the laptop I have to immediately text Alex "I bailed" and trigger the $1 donation? Walk me through how to set that up step-by-step so it actually happens instead of being another thing I ignore.

Therapist: Let's set up the automatic donation sequence:

1. Open the Charity Miles app on your phone.
2. Go to the "Settings" or "Donations" section.
3. Tap on "Create a new donation" or "Add a recurring donation".
4. Set the amount to $1.
5. Tap on "Create" or "Save".
6. Note the reference number or transaction ID (you'll need this to link it to your donation).

Now, when you close the laptop, you can text Alex "I bailed" and then immediately use the reference number to trigger the donation. You can do this by opening the Charity Miles app, selecting the donation, and entering the reference number.

To make it even more automatic, you can set up a keyboard shortcut or a shortcut on your phone to quickly open the app and enter the reference number. This way, when you close the laptop, you can quickly text Alex and trigger the donation without having to think about it too much.

Make sure to test this setup before you start, so you're comfortable with the process and can rely on it when you need it.

Patient: Ugh — this is a lot and already feels like one more huge setup I’ll avoid. Can you give me one ultra‑simple thing I can do in the next two minutes to test it (exact one‑line text to Alex if I bail, and the shortest possible step to make the $1 donation automatic)? Also, be real with me: how does making this automated actually stop me from freezing when the alarm goes off?
