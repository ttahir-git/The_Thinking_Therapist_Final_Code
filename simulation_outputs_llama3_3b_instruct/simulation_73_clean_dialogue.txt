Patient: Hey, thanks for seeing me. Lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed — this sadness and lack of motivation since my job situation fell apart has been sticking around and it's starting to mess with my relationship. I guess I'm trying to figure out how to feel like myself again, but I don't know, it's hard to even get started talking about it.

Therapist: That sounds really tough. When you say you're trying to figure out how to feel like yourself again, can you think of one specific thing you enjoyed doing before your job situation changed that you've been putting off or haven't done in a while?

Patient: I used to really enjoy going for long morning walks and messing around with my camera on weekends. I haven't done it in months — I guess I just don't have the energy, and I don't know, it feels weird to even admit that.

Therapist: It can be uncomfortable to acknowledge and act on feelings of weakness. What if, instead of beating yourself up about not being able to start taking those walks right now, you were to start with a tiny, manageable step – like committing to walk for just 5 minutes outside today?

Patient: I don't know... I guess five minutes sounds manageable, but I'm already thinking of reasons not to — what if it rains or I just get distracted and go back inside. Okay, fine, I can try to step outside for five minutes today, but I'm not promising I'll do more. And honestly, talking about this makes me uneasy—can we not make it into a judgment about whether I'm doing enough?

Therapist: Let's take a pause for a moment, and I want you to notice that thought "I'm not doing enough" as just a thought. Can you thank your mind for that thought, and then take a deep breath, without judgment? Then, what would it be like to simply take care of that 5-minute walk, even if you don't know what might happen afterwards?

Patient: I guess...okay, thanks, mind—that already feels weird to say out loud. I took a breath. Doing the walk might be like a tiny timeout, not some huge thing I have to prove, but I don't know, I'm a bit nervous about starting and I'd rather keep it simple than make it into a big deal.

Therapist: That's a really brave step – acknowledging the nervousness and choosing to keep it simple. Can you say it with me: "I'm willing to take a 5-minute walk outside today, just because it feels like a small, calm, gentle act that might help me feel a tiny bit better, without putting too much pressure on myself?"

Patient: I guess...okay. "I'm willing to take a 5-minute walk outside today, just because it feels like a small, calm, gentle act that might help me feel a tiny bit better, without putting too much pressure on myself." I'll try — I'm nervous about it, but I can give it a shot.

Therapist: Let's make a tiny commitment to you – just to take those 5 minutes. As you step outside, I want you to notice what's present in your body and surroundings, without judgment. Just observe, and see what shows up.

Patient: Okay — I actually stepped outside for five minutes. The air was cool, my chest felt tight and my legs kinda heavy, but I noticed a bird and a neighbor's dog and my first thought was, I guess, to take a picture with my camera, but I mostly just stood there and breathed. It didn't fix everything, but it felt a tiny bit less suffocating. I don't know, talking about how that felt is awkward, but I did it.

Therapist: It's interesting that taking that 5-minute walk didn't immediately fix everything, but it did help you feel a tiny bit more manageable. What's one value that's important to you – something that's related to feeling more grounded and connected in your life – and how might taking small, gentle acts like this help you live more in line with that value?

Patient: I guess a big value for me is connection — feeling close to my partner and to myself, and also keeping some creativity in my life. Those tiny things — the five-minute walk, fooling around with my camera — feel like small ways to be present and bring something back to my relationship instead of disappearing into sadness. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about, and can we also go over some simple, practical ways to fit this in without it becoming another thing I "should" do?

Therapist: That's a great insight – it sounds like these small acts of presence and creativity can help you nurture your connection with your partner and with yourself. What's one simple, concrete thing you can do this week to prioritize creativity and connection, perhaps in your relationship with your partner – not just in grand gestures, but in everyday moments?

Patient: I guess I could try setting aside 10 minutes after dinner twice this week for a tiny "photo share" — each of us shows one photo and says why it matters. I don't know, it feels awkward to plan it, but it's small, connects to my camera and creativity, and doesn't feel like a big "should."

Therapist: That sounds like a lovely idea – setting aside time for a "photo share" can be a gentle way to cultivate connection and creativity. Before we wrap up, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel a bit awkward about planning it – but it's also a sign that you're willing to take small steps. What if, instead of focusing on what might go wrong, you were to focus on what you might discover or experience during this "photo share" time with your partner?

Patient: I guess I might discover small, surprising things—like why a photo mattered to them or a tiny detail that makes me smile—and that could make me feel a bit closer instead of so distant. It might even remind me I still have little creative sparks left. I don't know, it's awkward to imagine it actually helping much, but I'm willing to try.

Therapist: That's a great attitude to have! I'd like to suggest we make a small commitment to you – to check in with your partner next week and share a photo, even if it's just for a minute or two. And while we're at it, take your camera with you, too, as a reminder of your creative spark.

Patient: Okay, I can try to check in with my partner next week and bring my camera — I guess that feels doable, even if I'm nervous about it. I don't know, I'm worried I might freeze up or get distracted and then it'll feel like another thing I failed at. Can we talk about a couple of simple ways to handle it if that happens, like a fallback plan or a phrase I can use so it doesn't spiral?

Therapist: It's completely normal to worry about failure, and having a plan can help. One simple way to handle it if you feel like you're getting stuck is to say to yourself, "I'm having trouble with this, but I'm willing to take a breath and start again." Another approach is to remind yourself that it's okay to just observe the experience, without putting too much pressure on yourself – "I'm just going to notice what's showing up, and see where it goes."

Patient: I guess those phrases might help, but I'm still worried I'll just freeze and nod and then feel worse. Maybe give me one super-simple fallback I can actually say without thinking—like “Give me a sec” or “I’m stuck, can we try again?” Also, can we do a quick practice now where you pretend to be my partner and I try the line? I don't know, role-playing feels weird, but maybe it's less terrifying than the real thing.

Therapist: One simple fallback phrase you could say is "Excuse me, I need a minute" – it acknowledges your need for a brief pause without making a big deal out of it. Let's practice it together. Imagine we're sitting together, and you say "Excuse me, I need a minute" – how does it feel?

Patient: I don't know...I guess saying "Excuse me, I need a minute" felt weird but also a little freeing, like it gives me permission to pause without making it dramatic. I'm still nervous I'll freeze when it matters—can we do that role-play now where you pretend to be my partner and I try the line?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. Imagine we're having dinner together, and I'll start by sharing a photo and explaining why it's special to me. You respond with the fallback phrase "Excuse me, I need a minute." Go ahead and say it, and I'll respond as your partner.

Patient: "Excuse me, I need a minute." I don't know... I guess I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed and need to breathe for a moment.

Therapist: That was a great response. It sounds like you're taking care of yourself and communicating your needs. Remember, taking a break is not a failure – it's a way to prioritize your own well-being and show up more fully in our connection. Can you think of a time when taking a break or slowing down helped you feel more connected or understood in a relationship?

Patient: I don't know... I guess once during a big argument I just left the room for a few minutes and walked outside, took a couple of silly photos, and breathed. When I came back we both were calmer and we actually talked instead of yelling, and it felt closer. It's weird to admit that, but can we talk about how to make those pauses feel less awkward?

Therapist: It's amazing that you recognize the impact of taking a pause. One way to make those moments feel less awkward is to try to focus on the physical sensation of your breath, rather than the thoughts or emotions surrounding the pause. Can you imagine taking a few deep breaths with me right now, and just noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Okay, I tried that — took a few deep breaths. My shoulders loosened a bit and the tightness in my chest eased, but I still feel kinda weird saying it out loud. I don't know, it helps a little, but can we work out a really simple, low-key signal I can use with my partner so the pause doesn't feel awkward?

Therapist: How about a simple gesture, like holding up your hand with your palm facing outwards, or giving a gentle squeeze on the arm? Something small and non-verbal that says "I need a break" without drawing attention to it. You can try it with me – just hold up your hand and say "Excuse me, I need a minute" and see how it feels.

Patient: I guess I tried holding up my hand and saying "Excuse me, I need a minute" — it felt awkward but also a little freeing, like I gave myself permission to pause. I don't know, I'm worried my partner might miss it; can we try a couple more super-low-key options, like a single tap on the table or a tiny thumb rub on my sleeve, and see which feels least weird?

Therapist: Let's try a few more options. What about a tiny tap on the table with your index finger, or a light touch on your sleeve with your thumb? You can do it now, just to see how it feels. We can even practice with me – go ahead and try one, and I'll respond as your partner.

Patient: I tapped the table with my index finger and said, "Excuse me, I need a minute." I don't know — it felt kind of stupid and my face warmed up, like I shouldn't need to do that, and it made me annoyingly frustrated with myself. I guess...can we try the thumb-on-sleeve version too?

Therapist: It can be awkward to feel like you need to use a signal like that. Let's try the thumb-on-sleeve version. Go ahead and touch your partner's arm with your thumb, just lightly, and say "Excuse me, I need a minute." Notice how you feel about this one.

Patient: I tried the thumb-on-sleeve and said "Excuse me, I need a minute" — it felt tiny but then this rush of shame and frustration hit me and my face got hot like I always do when things go wrong. I don't know, I guess using a signal makes me feel exposed and kind of stupid, and it's making me tense up. Can we try one more super-low-key option, or can you pretend to be my partner reacting so I can see how it might actually play out?

Therapist: Let's try something even simpler. Imagine we're having a conversation, and I'm just listening to you. I'll respond with a calm, gentle tone. Go ahead and say "I need a minute" without any signal, and see how I respond. We can just go with a quiet pause, and I'll give you space.

(Note: I'll respond as your partner, maintaining a calm and non-judgmental tone)

(Pretending to be your partner) "Okay, take your time. We can keep talking when you're ready."

Patient: Okay...I took a breath. I don't know, I appreciate that, but my face is hot and I keep feeling this stupid shame like I always mess things up — it's really annoying and makes me want to crawl away. I guess maybe I can try to share one small photo now, but I'm already bracing for freezing or stumbling over it. Can you just ask me something simple about the photo, like "What do you like about this?" so I have a place to start?

Therapist: Let's start with a gentle, non-judgmental question. You can share the photo and I'll ask you, "What's something about this photo that stands out to you?" It's a simple question that doesn't require a big response or a lot of thought. You can just share a brief observation or a feeling, and we can go from there.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the soft light on the old fence stands out — it's kind of quiet but oddly sharp. Looking at it makes me feel this rush of shame and frustration, like I should be enjoying small things but instead I get tense and embarrassed. Can you ask me another simple question about it, like "What does this moment remind you of?" — I get nervous talking, but that might help me keep going.

Therapist: Let's explore this further. What does the old fence and the soft light remind you of, in terms of values or emotions? Is there something about this moment that feels meaningful or nostalgic to you, despite the shame or frustration?

Patient: I don't know...it takes me back to slow Sunday mornings at my parents' place — calm, steady, a kind of small, ordinary comfort I don't have much of right now. Then this stupid rush of shame hits, like I should be enjoying it but I'm messing it up, and I tense up and want to look away. I guess it's meaningful because it shows I can still notice little beauties, and maybe that little noticing is a thread I could follow back toward feeling connected again.

Therapist: That's a beautiful connection to make. It sounds like noticing the small beauty in the world, like the soft light on the old fence, can be a way to tap into a sense of comfort and connection. What if, instead of trying to force or achieve a certain feeling, you could simply allow yourself to notice the small beauties in your life, even when they're hard to access or feel insignificant?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds okay in theory, but when I actually try to notice something small I get this stupid rush of shame and frustration like I'm failing again, and it makes me want to look away. It's awkward and I don't like feeling exposed. Could we do a really tiny exercise — like you ask me to name three small things I notice right now and I just answer one word each?

Therapist: Let's do a tiny exercise. I'll ask you to name three small things you notice right now, one word each. Just a single word. No explanation, no judgment. What are three words that come to mind?

Patient: light
tightness
ashamed

Therapist: Can you explore what the word "ashamed" might be trying to tell you? What's its function in your experience?

Patient: I don't know...I guess "ashamed" is this loud, annoying voice that tells me I'm not enough, like I'm letting everyone down — it tightens my chest, my face goes hot, and I want to crawl away. It feels like both a warning and a punishment: it pushes me to fix things but mostly just freezes me and makes me furious with myself. I'm sorry, it's embarrassing to say that out loud, but that's what it does.

Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Can you thank the "ashamed" voice for showing up, and acknowledge its role in your experience? Let's say it out loud together: "Thank you for showing up, ashamed voice. You're trying to protect me, I think. But I want to acknowledge that you're not always accurate, and that you can be a barrier to connection and creativity."

Patient: I don't know... I guess, "Thank you for showing up, ashamed voice. You're trying to protect me, but you make me feel small and keep me from connecting and being creative." Saying that actually stung — my face feels hot and I'm pissed at myself, like I want to crawl away. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down or do something really simple next, like one tiny question I can answer in one word?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. Can you simply say "relax" with me? Just one word.

Patient: I don't know...okay — "relax." I said it, but my chest is still tight and this stupid shame is buzzing, like I keep failing even at that. Can we slow down and do one tiny thing I can actually manage next?
