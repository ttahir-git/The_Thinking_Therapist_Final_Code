Patient: I've been stuck with this constant anger and frustration lately—small things, especially anything to do with my ex, set me off. I'm a teacher and burned out, and I keep snapping at colleagues and feeling like I'm losing control. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried breathing exercises and talking it out and it didn't work—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel the anger and frustration creeping up? Is it a specific situation, like a particular topic or person, or is it more of a general feeling that just shows up?

Patient: It usually starts with a small trigger—seeing their name, a text from a mutual friend, or even a song—and I get this pressure in my chest, my jaw clenches, my hands shake, and I feel like I could snap. Most of the time I either lash out at whoever's there or I go quiet and replay every stupid interaction over and over. But seriously, how is talking through this or doing another breathing exercise supposed to stop me from exploding next time?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling trapped by your anger, and you're looking for a way to break free. What would happen if, instead of trying to suppress or escape your anger, you allowed yourself to feel it fully, without judgment or resistance, and then took a small, gentle step towards someone or something you value, like a cup of tea or a short walk?

Patient: I get the idea, but honestly letting myself feel it just feels like pouring gasoline on a fire—when I try to sit with it I start replaying everything and get angrier. The "small step" sounds reasonable on paper, but when my jaw's clenched and my hands are shaking I can barely think about making tea or going for a walk; how is that supposed to be realistic in the moment? I've tried sitting with it before and it just turned into thirty minutes of ruminating—how does feeling it fully actually stop me from snapping or saying things I'll regret?

Therapist: It makes sense that trying to sit with your anger without any support or strategies can lead to rumination. What if, instead of trying to manage your anger through internal means, you took a small step that would help you create some space from the trigger and the emotions that follow? For example, would you be willing to take a 5-minute break from the situation or conversation, even if it's just to step outside and get some fresh air?

Patient: Maybe — but I'm skeptical. At school I can't always step out for five minutes without it causing a scene or leaving students unattended, and the few times I did try to leave I just stood outside replaying everything anyway. I could try a super-short break, like one or two minutes in the staffroom or a quick walk to the copier, but how is that really supposed to stop my jaw from clenching or my head from spiraling?

Therapist: Can you think of a specific student or group of students that you value and care about deeply, and imagine that you're able to maintain a connection with them even in this moment of anger? Would you be willing to take just 30 seconds to acknowledge and respond to them in a kind way, even if it's just a nod or a brief greeting?

Patient: I do care about my Year 8s—especially Sam; he's been trying lately and I don't want to let him down. I guess I could manage a quick nod or a brief "well done" for 30 seconds, but when I'm that keyed up it feels hollow and like I'm faking it—how is that supposed to help? I've tried pretending to be fine before and it just left me tenser afterward.

Therapist: It's understandable that you'd feel like you're faking it. Can you try this: instead of focusing on managing your anger, what if you focus on the fact that Sam is counting on you to be present and supportive? Imagine that you're making space for a valued action, not to change your feelings, but to stay connected with Sam, even if it's just for a brief moment?

Patient: I do care about Sam, and I guess I could try to make space for him even when I'm tense — a quick nod or a "well done" shouldn't be that hard. But honestly, when I force it I just feel fake and tighter afterward, like I'm bottling everything up until I blow. How is doing a tiny supportive thing now supposed to stop me from exploding later when the anger's still there?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control your anger, you simply acknowledged that it's there, and made a commitment to yourself to be kind to Sam, even when you're feeling tense or angry? Would you be willing to do that, even if it means not being able to manage the anger itself?

Patient: I can try to do that for Sam — I don't want to let him down. But honestly I'm skeptical: being kind in the moment feels like putting a lid on a pressure cooker; it might stop the immediate thing, but it doesn't stop the build-up and I'm worried it'll make the blow-up worse later. I'm tired of advice that sounds good on paper but doesn't change the jaw-clenching and replaying afterward — how is committing to "be kind" supposed to actually help with that?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to manage your anger or be kind to others, you tried being kind to yourself, even when you're feeling tense or angry? Would you be willing to give yourself a small kindness, like taking a few deep breaths, noticing your physical sensations, or acknowledging that it's okay to feel overwhelmed?

Patient: I mean, I could try being kinder to myself, but I've done the deep-breathing thing and it just made me more aware of how tense I am — then I sit there replaying everything. Honestly, I don't see how noticing sensations actually stops the jaw clench or the replaying afterward; how is that supposed to help in the moment or later?

Therapist: Can you think of a value that's important to you, something that you're willing to stand for, even when it's uncomfortable? For example, is it the value of being a good teacher, or the value of being honest with yourself and others? What would it be like if, in this moment, you chose to stand in that value, even if it means not being able to manage your anger perfectly?

Patient: I guess my main value is being a good teacher — not letting my students, like Sam, down even when I'm a mess. If I tried to stand in that, I'd probably force myself to be present and do the right thing, but honestly it would feel hollow and like I'm just postponing the explosion. How is that supposed to help with the jaw clench and the replaying afterward?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to manage your anger or be a perfect teacher, you allowed yourself to be a teacher who is human, who makes mistakes, who has tough days? Would you be willing to take a small step towards being more authentic, even if it means not being able to manage your anger perfectly? For example, you could take a moment to write down your thoughts and feelings after class, or acknowledge to yourself that you're struggling, without feeling like you have to be strong all the time.

Patient: Maybe I could try writing for five minutes after class — just jotting down what went wrong and how I felt. But even saying that makes me feel ashamed, like I'm admitting I blew it again, and I can already hear myself rereading it and spiraling into the same loop. How is writing supposed to stop the jaw clench or the replaying later? I've tried similar things and they just turned into more proof that I'm failing.

Therapist: Can you try to approach writing as an act of kindness towards yourself, rather than a way to criticize or evaluate yourself? Would you be willing to write a kind message to yourself, like "I'm doing the best I can, even when it's hard" or "I'm allowed to make mistakes, and that's okay"?

Patient: I could try, but just thinking about writing that kind of thing brings up this sinking shame like I’ve already failed again — it makes the whole thing feel fake. If I wrote “I’m doing the best I can” I’d probably read it later and think I’m lying to myself. How is that supposed to help with the jaw clench and replaying? If we’re doing this, can you help me write something that doesn’t sound like a platitude and might actually stick?

Therapist: Can you try writing a message that acknowledges your anger and frustration, without trying to change or judge it? For example, "My anger is here, and it's okay that it's here. I'm feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, and that's okay. I'm going to take a deep breath and do the best I can to show up for Sam, even when I'm feeling this way."

Patient: Maybe something like: "My anger is here and it's allowed to be — I'm frustrated and ashamed, and that doesn't make me a failure. I can do one small thing for Sam now, then come back and sit with this later without judging myself." 

I could write that, I guess — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop my jaw from clenching? It still feels pretty hollow.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the jaw clenching is a physical manifestation of your anger, and that it's okay for it to be there? Instead of trying to stop it, what if you focus on taking small, gentle actions that honor your value of being a good teacher for Sam, like taking a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then doing one small thing for him, like giving him a kind word or a smile?

Patient: I can picture forcing a slow breath and giving Sam a quick "good job" or a half-smile, but saying that already makes me feel kind of ashamed, like I'm covering up something I can't fix. The jaw's still clenched in my head and I can hear myself replaying everything afterward. I guess I could try one breath and a nod in the moment, but honestly—how is that supposed to stop the build-up later or keep me from finally exploding?

Therapist: Can you try to approach your anger as a momentary experience, rather than a reflection of your character or worth? Instead of trying to stop or manage your anger, what if you simply acknowledge it as a sensation that's passing, like the sensation of your feet touching the ground or the sound of the bell ringing? This might help you develop a sense of acceptance and equanimity, even when you're feeling angry.

Patient: Maybe I can try to think of it as passing, but when I do that it usually just slides into another loop and leaves me feeling ashamed and flat. How is telling myself it's "just a moment" supposed to stop the jaw clench or the replaying afterward? I can try it, but I'm not convinced.

Therapist: Can you try approaching your anger as a puzzle, rather than a fixed problem to be solved? What if, instead of trying to figure out how to get rid of the anger, you simply observe it as it arises, without judgment or attachment? You might start by noticing the sensation of the anger, the physical sensations in your body, without trying to label or analyze it. Just observe, without judgment, and see what happens.

Patient: Maybe I can try treating it like a puzzle, but I already feel this sinking shame—like every observation just becomes more evidence I'm failing, and then I spiral. How is watching the sensations supposed to stop my jaw from clenching or the replay afterward? If we're actually going to try it, give me one concrete, tiny step I can do right now in the staffroom without leaving students—something real so I don't just sit there and stew.

Therapist: Can you try taking a single, small action that shows up for Sam, without trying to manage or suppress your anger? For example, as you're in the staffroom, take a moment to write a single word or phrase on a sticky note, like "You are doing the best you can," and then leave it on Sam's desk, so he sees it when he's getting ready for class. This small act can be a way to show up for him and honor your value as a teacher, without trying to manage your anger.

Patient: I mean, I could try the sticky-note, but it already feels like another performative thing that’ll just make me feel worse if it flops. I’m not sure I follow how slipping a note stops the jaw clench or the replay—can you give me one exact, non-platitude line to write and a really quick, low‑profile way to leave it in the staffroom without drawing attention?

Therapist: Can you try writing a single, simple sentence on a sticky note, without drawing attention to it: "My jaw is tight". Then, quickly leave the note on the staffroom counter, without looking at it or drawing attention to it, and take a deep breath.

Patient: Okay. I can do that — write “My jaw is tight,” drop it on the counter without making a fuss, and take one slow breath after. It already feels embarrassing and like I’m confessing I failed, and I don’t really follow how this stops the jaw clench or the replay afterward. But fine — I’ll try it, even if I’m not convinced.

Therapist: Can you take a moment to focus on the sensation of your breath, without trying to control it or change it? Just notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment. See if you can stay with that sensation for just one more breath.

Patient: Okay — I'll try one breath. I notice my jaw's still tight, my chest is jittery, and my head's already racing to other stuff; the breath felt slightly softer but it didn't erase the tension or the shame that's creeping back in. How is that supposed to help when the replay starts five minutes later? If I'm doing this, what's one concrete thing I can do right after that breath to actually stop myself from snapping or spiraling?

Therapist: Can you try taking a small step towards a break, without trying to manage or control the tension? For example, get up from your seat and walk to the water fountain to grab a glass of water, or move to a different chair to sit down. The physical act of moving can help you create some space and distract you from the replaying of thoughts.

Patient: I can maybe get water — but I’m already dreading how stupid that’ll look, like I can’t handle my job. Even if I move, I’ll probably just stand at the fountain replaying everything and my jaw staying tight. How is walking supposed to stop the replay or the snapping later? Fine — I’ll try to stand up and get a glass, but I’m not expecting miracles.

Therapist: As you walk to the water fountain, allow yourself to experience the physical sensations of getting up and moving, without judgment. When you arrive, notice the sensation of the water on your skin, the sound of the water flowing, and the feeling of the glass in your hand. Focus on the physical sensations and the present moment, without trying to control or change them.

Patient: I went and got the water — the glass was cold, the sound helped for a second — but my jaw’s still tight, my chest’s jittery, and my head’s already darting to other stuff. I’m not sure I follow how noticing the water actually stops the replay later; it felt like a tiny distraction, not a fix. This is hard to keep doing, and it just makes me feel embarrassed and like I failed again — what’s one concrete thing I can do as soon as I sit back down that might actually stop me from snapping or spiraling?

Therapist: Can you try taking a slow, deliberate sip of the water, without tasting or swallowing, and then putting the glass down? The act of sipping slowly and deliberately can help you focus on the present moment, and create a small sense of calm.

Patient: I did the slow sip. It quieted things for a second—the cold glass, the tiny pause—but my jaw's still cramped, my chest's buzzing, and I feel this stupid shame like I already blew it. I don't see how sipping water stops me from snapping or replaying five minutes later. What's one exact thing I can do the second I sit back down to actually keep from exploding or spiraling?

Therapist: Can you try, as soon as you sit back down, to say to yourself: "I am having an angry experience right now." Say it out loud, with kindness and curiosity, and allow the words to be true.

Patient: Okay — I said it out loud: "I am having an angry experience right now." Saying it felt awkward and kind of humiliating; my jaw's still tight, my chest's buzzing, and it just seemed to make the shame sink in more. How is that supposed to help when five minutes from now I'm replaying everything? Tell me one exact, concrete thing I can do the second I'm back with students that might actually stop me from snapping.

Therapist: Can you try, as soon as you're back with students, to take a moment to acknowledge and accept their presence, without trying to be perfect or manage your emotions. Look them in the eye, and say: "Good morning, Sam. I'm here now." Focus on the physical act of seeing them, and the sound of your own voice, rather than trying to control or manage your emotions.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—look them in the eye and say that? I can force out, "Good morning, Sam. I'm here now," but it already feels humiliating and like I'm pretending, and my jaw's still clenched and my head's racing. If I do it, what's one exact thing I can do right after that to actually stop myself from exploding or replaying it later? I hate that I keep circling back to feeling like I failed.

Therapist: Can you try, immediately after saying "Good morning, Sam," to take a brief pause and make eye contact with Sam, and then say "Thank you for being here" with a gentle and sincere tone. This small action can help you acknowledge and accept your emotions, and create a sense of connection with Sam, which can help you stay grounded in the present moment.

Patient: I can force out "Good morning, Sam" and a quiet "thank you for being here," but it feels humiliating and like I'm pretending — my jaw's still tight and my head's already starting to replay. I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the blow-up later; what's one exact, tiny thing I do right after saying that that might actually keep me from snapping or spiraling?

Therapist: Can you try, immediately after saying "Good morning, Sam" and "Thank you for being here", to gently place a hand on Sam's shoulder or arm, and say "I'm so glad you're here, Sam"? This small physical touch can help you connect with Sam in a more genuine way, and create a sense of safety and calm.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — putting a hand on Sam feels risky and it makes me feel ashamed just thinking about it, so I can't do that. I can force out the words, but my jaw's still tight and I keep replaying everything; how is that supposed to stop the build‑up or the explosion later? If you're going to ask me to try, give me one exact, tiny, discreet thing I can do immediately after (something I can do under the desk or with my fingers) that might actually help the tension instead of making me feel fake.

Therapist: Can you try, immediately after saying "Good morning, Sam" and "Thank you for being here", to subtly touch your own hand or arm with your fingers, without drawing attention to it. Just lightly place your fingers together, or touch the edge of the desk, and focus on the physical sensation of your hand touching itself. This small, discreet action can help calm your nervous system and create a sense of stability.

Patient: Okay — I'm not sure I follow, but I can try: I'll slip my hand under the desk and lightly press my fingertips together so no one notices. It already feels embarrassing and shameful, my jaw's still clenched, and I don't see how that actually calms the jaw or stops the replaying later — what exactly should I be noticing while I do it?
