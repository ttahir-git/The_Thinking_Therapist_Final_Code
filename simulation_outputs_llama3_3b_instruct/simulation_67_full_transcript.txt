Patient: I'm an older social worker, and lately I've been feeling really stuck and kind of lost—like everything that matters about me is just my job. Add the constant money stress and I can't seem to see who I am beyond my caseload. I've talked about this before and it didn't help much, so... how is this supposed to change anything?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You express a sense of hopelessness and feeling stuck in your personal life, which is closely tied to your sense of identity. The underlying concern seems to be that your job is defining you, and you're struggling to reconnect with your personal values and sense of self beyond your professional role. Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of feeling stuck and how it's affecting your sense of identity.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what you mean by feeling like your job defines you? What are some specific things that you worry will happen or that you feel like you're losing if you're not a social worker?

Patient: I guess I worry I’d lose my sense of purpose — the thing that makes me useful and worth something — if I’m not the one helping people every day. I’d lose the routine, the colleagues, and yes, the income that keeps the lights on, so it feels like everything practical and emotional is tied up in the job. I’m also scared of feeling invisible or useless, like there’s nothing left of me beyond case notes. But I’ve brought this up before with others — how is talking about that supposed to actually help me, honestly?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're caught in a cycle of feeling tied to your job and worried about losing a sense of purpose, identity, and self-worth. The concern is that exploring these feelings won't help, which suggests a sense of hopelessness and disconnection from your values. Goal: Introduce a willingness as an alternative to struggle, and explore how to create space from the "stuck" feeling.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you might feel like bringing it up again won't make a difference. It's possible that the feelings you're experiencing are deeply ingrained. However, I want to suggest that sometimes, just acknowledging and talking about our struggles can be a small step towards creating space for change. What if, instead of focusing on what's causing the feeling of being stuck, we explored what it might be like to have some more flexibility in your life, even if it's just a small amount? For example, what would it be like to take a break from work and engage in an activity that brings you joy, or to have some extra time to explore your own interests?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I can't just take long breaks — the bills don't care — and when I tried hobbies before they felt hollow and I felt guilty for not working. Maybe a tiny thing, like a 15-minute walk or listening to an old radio program, could be doable, but I'm not convinced it'll change the bigger sense of nobody-being-me-without-work.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that small, fleeting moments of relaxation or self-care won't be enough to address the deeper feeling of being defined by your job and worried that others will see you as "useless" without it. The fear of guilt and obligation is strong, which suggests a sense of fusion with the idea that your worth is tied to your productivity. Goal: Introduce a small, value-driven behavioral step to start creating space from the feeling of being "stuck."

Therapist Answer:
I understand that taking a break or engaging in small moments of self-care can feel like a luxury you can't afford. But what if, instead of seeing it as a luxury, we framed it as a way to take care of yourself and maintain your energy for your work? Can you imagine what it would be like to commit to doing just one small thing that feels enjoyable to you, without any expectation of productivity or self-worth tied to it? For example, you mentioned a 15-minute walk – what would happen if you did that today, without any agenda or expectation?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Maybe if I took a 15-minute walk today I'd notice the sun or an old song on the radio and feel a little lighter for a bit, but then the guilt kicks in — the bills, the work waiting, and that creeping thought that it’s all just temporary. I could try it, but honestly I’m skeptical it’ll change the bigger problem; I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're right to question the effectiveness of a single 15-minute walk in addressing the underlying concerns. The experience of guilt and the temporary nature of the feeling of relief suggest that the issue is more complex and tied to your values and sense of self-worth. Goal: Connect the small, value-driven behavioral step to the larger sense of purpose and identity.

Therapist Answer:
I think it's interesting that you mention the thought that it's all just temporary. What if, instead of focusing on the impermanence of the walk, we looked at it as an opportunity to practice being with the present moment, without judgment? Can you think of a specific value that's important to you, something that feels meaningful and worth prioritizing, even if it's just for a short time? For example, is it the value of being present and mindful, or the value of taking care of your physical health?

Patient: I guess what matters to me is being useful—helping people and staying connected to others. I also care about stability and a bit of curiosity or creativity, though I haven't made time for that in years. But how is naming a value supposed to help when the bills and the work don't just disappear?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified some important values that are important to you, but the practical concerns of bills and work are still a significant source of anxiety. The challenge is to connect these values to the feeling of being "stuck" and find a way to act on them in a way that feels meaningful and sustainable. Goal: Introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill that can help you create space from the feeling of being "stuck."

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to explore a small, concrete action that can help you connect with one of your values. Can you think of a small, 30-second action that you can take right now to show up for someone else, even if it's just a kind word or a gentle gesture? This could be as simple as sending a text to a friend, making a cup of coffee for a colleague, or leaving a kind note for a family member. What would happen if you did this action, and how might it help you feel more connected to your value of being useful?

Patient: Maybe I could send a one-line text to an old colleague or a former client — something like, "Thinking of you, hope you're doing okay." It might give me a tiny boost, remind me I still matter and that my words can help, even if just for a moment. But how is that supposed to help with the bigger stuff — the bills and that hollow feeling that I'm nothing without the job? I'm trying to see the connection, but I'm really struggling with that.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a small, low-stakes action that can help you connect with your value of being useful and remind you of your worth. The question is how to connect this to the bigger concerns about financial stability and the feeling of being defined by your job. Goal: Create space from the "stuck" feeling by exploring the relationship between your actions, values, and sense of self-worth.

Therapist Answer:
Let's look at the context in which you're thinking about sending that text. Can you think about what happens when you send that text? What happens to the feeling of "I'm nothing without the job"? Does it fade a bit, or does it come up again? What might it mean that sending this text doesn't solve the problem of financial stability, but it does give you a sense of connection and meaning?

Patient: It helps for a moment — I get that little warmth, like someone still needs me — but it’s fleeting and the old doubts come rushing back, plus the bills are still there. I feel proud I reached out and guilty I wasn’t doing more productive work at the same time. How is that supposed to help me feel less stuck in any lasting way, though? What would you suggest I do next when the lift wears off?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the temporary nature of the feeling of connection and warmth that comes from sending the text, and the return of doubts and guilt. This suggests that the action, as meaningful as it is, doesn't directly address the sense of being stuck in your life. Goal: Introduce a process to help you create space from the feelings of guilt, doubt, and inadequacy.

Therapist Answer:
It's like taking a breath, isn't it? The feeling of warmth and connection is like a small breath of air, and then it's gone. Let's try something different. Can you imagine, when the feeling of warmth wears off, what would you like to notice instead? Instead of dwelling on what's not happening (the bills, the doubts, etc.), what if you focused on what is happening in your body, right now, as you sit here? Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you allow that sensation to be what you focus on for a moment, without judgment or agenda?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — though honestly, how is that supposed to help? I can feel my feet on the floor, a dull ache in my knees, and a tightness in my chest, but my head keeps darting off to the bills and that stack of case notes. It settles me for a breath or two, maybe, but I'm not sure how that gets me unstuck when the worry comes back.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain focus on the present moment, and your mind keeps wandering back to the concerns of bills and work. This suggests that you're deeply invested in managing and avoiding the feeling of being stuck, rather than exploring a more direct way to address it. Goal: Introduce defusion as a process to help you gently step back from the "stuck" feeling and the thoughts that come with it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to gently diffuse the experience of your thoughts. Can you allow the thought that's darting through your mind, "I have a stack of case notes and bills to worry about," to simply be a thought, without judgment or action? Imagine it as a cloud passing across the sky, without getting caught up in its details or trying to push it away. What if, instead of trying to manage or avoid the thought, you simply acknowledged it, and then gently let it drift away?

Patient: I can picture the thought as a cloud for a second and it does ease the tightness a bit, but then the cloud brings the bills and the case notes with it and I’m back to square one. How is that supposed to help with paying rent or feeling like I’m more than my job? I keep trying these little tricks and they calm me for a breath, but what do I do when the worry comes roaring back and I feel guilty for not doing “real” work?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain a sense of defusion, and the cloud of thoughts keeps bringing the same concerns back. This suggests that you're still deeply invested in managing and avoiding the feeling of being stuck, and that the strategies so far haven't provided a sustainable sense of relief. Goal: Introduce a more fundamental shift in your relationship with your values and the idea of "work."

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore a different way of thinking about what it means to be a useful person, and what your values are beyond your job. Can you think of a time when you felt most alive, engaged, and connected to your own sense of purpose, before you started focusing on your job? What were you doing in that moment, and what values were you prioritizing?

Patient: Yeah — I remember when I used to run a little Saturday storytelling group at the community center: people would come, we'd share memories, and I felt genuinely alive and useful — like I was connecting curiosity and compassion. Those moments put my values front-and-center: connection, creativity, and helping people feel heard. But honestly, how is remembering that supposed to help now when the bills and the caseload won't just disappear?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a moment when you felt a sense of purpose and fulfillment, but it's not currently applicable to your current situation. The challenge is to connect that sense of purpose and values to your current life, despite the difficulties. Goal: Create space for a more nuanced exploration of the values that are relevant to your life now.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore what it would take for you to reconnect with those values in a way that feels relevant to your current situation. Can you imagine that the community center group didn't disappear with you, and you're still the facilitator? What would that look like in your daily life, even if it's not in the same way? For example, how might you prioritize connection and compassion in your work with clients, or how might you bring creativity into your daily tasks?

Patient: I can picture small things — opening sessions with a two-minute story prompt, asking a client to bring an object that matters to them, making my notes a little more human, or trying to run that storytelling group one Saturday a month. But how is that supposed to help when funders want numbers and I’m juggling deadlines and the bills — I’m already spread thin. I’m willing to try one tiny change, but I’m skeptical and honestly a bit overwhelmed that it’ll actually shift this stuck, directionless feeling.

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the potential for small, incremental changes to be meaningful, but the feeling of overwhelm and skepticism is still present. The challenge is to find a way to build confidence in the ability to make small changes and to create a sense of progress, despite the demands of your current situation. Goal: Introduce a sense of commitment to small, value-driven actions.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that you're willing to try a small change, and that's a great starting point. Can you commit to taking one tiny step this week, not because you think it will magically solve everything, but because it's a small act of self-care and a way to show up for yourself and your values? It could be as simple as taking a few deep breaths before your next client meeting, or bringing a small plant to your workspace. What would it take for you to take that one tiny step, and what might happen if you do?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try one tiny step: before my next client I’ll take three slow breaths, and today I’ll send that one-line text to an old colleague. What it’ll take is me actually setting a timer and giving myself permission, which is hard because I get this shame and that old “you’re not doing enough” voice bubbling up and I get frustrated with myself. How is that supposed to help? I don’t know, but maybe it’ll steady me for a moment and remind me I’m still useful — and when the lift fades I’ll need help noticing it without beating myself up.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete action you're willing to take, and a recognition of the inner critic that's holding you back. The goal is to help you develop a sense of self-compassion and a way to gently notice the subtle shifts in your experience without getting caught up in self-criticism. Goal: Introduce a sense of self-compassion and gentle observation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's work with the sensation of the shame and frustration that arises when you think about taking that tiny step. Can you notice what happens in your body when you feel that sense of shame? Where do you feel it in your chest, your stomach, or your head? And when you notice it, what's the first thought that arises, exactly?

Patient: It gets heavy in my chest, like a weight, and my stomach knots up — my shoulders hunch and my jaw tightens, breath gets shallow and my hands get fidgety. The first thought is almost always, "You're not doing enough, you're failing, they'll see you're useless," and that thought brings a hot sinking shame that makes me want to push everything away. But… how is noticing that supposed to stop it? I already feel frustrated with myself just talking about it.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've vividly described the physical sensations and thoughts that accompany feelings of shame and self-criticism. The challenge is to help you develop a sense of self-compassion and acceptance of these experiences, rather than trying to push them away or avoid them. Goal: Introduce a sense of curiosity and acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to observe these sensations and thoughts with a sense of curiosity, rather than judgment. Can you allow the weight in your chest to be exactly as it is, without trying to push it away or change it? Notice the sensation of the knot in your stomach, the tightening of your jaw, and the shallow breath. Allow these sensations to be present, without trying to control them or change them. And when the thought "You're not doing enough" arises, can you simply acknowledge it, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to let the weight be there. When I do, that hot sinking shame I get from…stuff before flares up and I get pissed at myself, like, "Great, here we go again," my breath goes shallow and my hands fidget and my head races to the bills. But honestly, how is just noticing that supposed to stop the spiral or pay the rent?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the tendency to react to the shame and self-criticism with more shame and frustration. The goal is to help you develop a sense of self-compassion and acceptance of these experiences, rather than trying to change them. Goal: Introduce a sense of possibility and exploration.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore what might happen if, instead of trying to stop the spiral, we explored what's underneath it. What do you think might be driving the need to react to shame and self-criticism in this way? Is it fear, perhaps? Or maybe it's a sense of responsibility to yourself or others? What would it take for you to feel more comfort with this sense of shame, rather than reacting to it?

Patient: I honestly don't know — when that shame hits it feels like a freight train, my chest clamps down, my stomach knots, and I just get furious at myself. Maybe I'd feel more comfortable if I had concrete, practiced responses — short phrases to say, a tiny ritual to pause and breathe, or a visible cue at work so I don't automatically spiral — but how is that supposed to help? I've tried the "be kind to yourself" stuff before and it felt hollow; if anything might work it would be doing the same small thing over and over until it's automatic, or having someone nudge me in the moment, but I'm still skeptical it'll shift that deep shame.

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the desire for a sense of control and predictability in responding to shame, and the skepticism about whether it will be enough to change the underlying feelings. The challenge is to help you develop a sense of faith in the process, rather than relying on a specific strategy. Goal: Introduce a sense of curiosity and exploration of possibilities.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to explore what would happen if, instead of trying to prepare a specific response or ritual, you simply allowed yourself to be with the shame as it arises. What would it take for you to feel a sense of curiosity, rather than judgment or resistance, when the shame shows up?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When that shame hits — a sudden intrusive feeling of failure — I freeze, my jaw tightens, and I get that hot, angry shame that makes curiosity feel impossible. Maybe curiosity could work if I had a tiny, concrete anchor (a note on my desk, a two-word script, or someone to nudge me) and practised it until it was automatic, but I'm really skeptical it’ll touch the money worries or that deep “you’re not enough” feeling.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the need for a concrete anchor or cue to help you access curiosity in the midst of shame, but you're skeptical that it will be enough to address the underlying feelings. The challenge is to help you explore the possibility that the anchor or cue is not the solution, but rather a way to create space for something else to happen. Goal: Introduce a sense of defusion and exploration of possibilities.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to explore what might happen if, instead of relying on the anchor or cue, you simply allowed yourself to be with the shame as it arises. What if, instead of trying to use a specific tool or strategy, you allowed yourself to feel the shame, without trying to do anything with it? Can you imagine being with the shame, without judgment, without trying to change it or respond to it?

Patient: I can try — though honestly it feels impossible when that hot, angry shame hits; my jaw clamps, I freeze, and my chest just drops. Curiosity feels like a luxury then, not a skill I can call on, so I'd need a tiny anchor — a two-word script, a note on my desk, someone to nudge me — and a lot of practice until it’s automatic. But how is that supposed to help with the bills and that gnawing “you’re not enough” feeling that keeps roaring back?

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the difficulty of accessing curiosity in the midst of intense shame, and the desire for a tangible anchor to help you access it. The challenge is to help you explore the possibility that the anchor or cue is not the solution, but rather a way to create space for a more fundamental shift. Goal: Introduce a sense of connection to the anchor and the possibility of defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore what might happen if, instead of trying to use the anchor or cue, you simply noticed the sensation of your jaw clamping, your chest dropping, and your mind racing. What would it be like to notice these physical sensations, without judgment, without trying to change them? Can you imagine being present with the physical sensations, without trying to push away or react to the shame that's arising?

Patient: I can try to notice, but it's hard — my jaw's clamped, my chest drops, breath's shallow and my hands won't stop fidgeting, and my head keeps darting to the bills and the case notes. When I try to "just notice" it feels like standing in the middle of a kitchen fire and watching the smoke — how is that supposed to stop me from spiraling? Can we slow down a bit? I really need something concrete and short I can say or do in the moment, because curiosity feels impossible when that shame hits.

Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the difficulty of noticing the physical sensations and the overwhelming feeling of shame, and the desire for a more concrete and immediate solution. The challenge is to help you explore the possibility that a simple, concrete action can actually create space for noticing and responding to your experiences in a different way. Goal: Introduce a sense of simplicity and clarity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to simplify things. Can you simply say to yourself, "I'm here" when the shame hits? No judgment, no evaluation, just "I'm here". Can you imagine saying that phrase to yourself, without thinking about what it means or trying to use it to change your situation?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Saying "I'm here" feels hollow when that hot shame hits — my jaw clamps, my hands fidget, and my head bolts to the bills. I can try it once or twice; maybe it’ll steady me for a breath, but I need something a bit stronger and concrete I can stick on a note, like "I'm here. I'm doing what I can." Can we slow down and pick a short two- or three-word phrase I can actually use in the moment?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the difficulty of using a simple phrase to steady yourself in the midst of intense shame, and the desire for a more concrete and powerful statement. The challenge is to help you explore the possibility that a short, simple phrase can actually create space for a more profound shift. Goal: Introduce a sense of clarity and concrete action.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to find a short phrase that feels more substantial to you. Can you think of a phrase that includes a sense of commitment or agency, like "I'm here, I'm doing my best" or "I'll show up for myself"? Write down a few options and see if any resonate with you. Then, let's narrow it down to one phrase that feels like it can be used in the moment when you need it.

Patient: Okay — I jotted down a few short ones: "I'm doing my best," "This will pass," "Do what I can," and "Not my fault." How is that supposed to help? When that hot, sinking shame hits my jaw clamps and my chest drops and words go hollow — but if I have one on a sticky note on my desk and practice it until it's automatic, maybe it could steady me for a breath. I’ll pick "I'm doing my best" for now, but I want help figuring out how to actually get it to stick — where to put it and a quick practice I can do in the moment.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a few short phrases that feel empowering and might help you respond to shame in a more positive way. The challenge is to help you find a strategic way to place the phrase where you can see it and practice it regularly, so it becomes an automatic response. Goal: Introduce a sense of practicality and habituation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's find a strategic spot for the sticky note. Can you think of a place where you'll see it frequently, like your monitor or on your desk? And can you imagine a quick practice you can do in the moment, like taking a deep breath and reading the phrase to yourself, or saying it out loud with a slight pause before the words come out? For example, "I'm doing my best" (pause) "I'm doing my best" (pause)

Patient: Alright — I’ll put one on the bottom of my monitor where I can’t miss it and one inside my day planner. I’ll try the quick practice: one slow breath, then say “I’m doing my best” out loud twice with a tiny pause. But I’m skeptical — when that hot shame hits my jaw clamps and my head bolts to the bills, the words go hollow; how do I actually get this to stick? Maybe a phone reminder or a two-second nudge before each client would help — can we pick one concrete nudge I can use?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a plan to place the sticky notes and practice the phrase, and you're considering additional strategies to help make it stick. The challenge is to help you find a way to trigger the phrase in the moment, without relying on external reminders or nudges. Goal: Introduce a sense of mindfulness and presence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to focus on the physical sensations that occur when you feel the shame hitting. Can you notice what happens in your body when your jaw clamps, your chest drops, and your head bolts to the bills? Where do you feel it in your body, and what do you notice in your breath or your physical sensations? Then, let's try to create a subtle physical cue to trigger the phrase, like a slight movement of your wrist or a brief shift in your gaze. For example, could you notice a subtle shift in your wrist as you prepare to say the phrase, or a brief glance at the sticky note on your monitor?

Patient: Okay — I notice it straight away: jaw clamps, chest drops, breath gets shallow, hands fidget, and then that hot, sinking shame starts yelling at me. If I had a tiny physical cue — like pressing my thumb to my wrist, or rubbing a pebble in my pocket, or a quick glance down at the sticky note on my monitor — maybe that could interrupt the spin and trigger the phrase. 

So here's what I could try: sticky note on the monitor, a phone reminder 2 minutes before a client, then right before I open the file I press my thumb to my wrist, take one slow breath and say, out loud, “I’m doing my best” twice. But how is that supposed to help when the shame hits full force and the words go hollow? I need help making that practice actually stick — can we do a very short rehearsal now or pick the single most reliable nudge so I don’t keep fiddling and failing?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a physical cue that can trigger the phrase, and you've outlined a plan to use it in different contexts. The challenge is to help you rehearse the practice in a way that makes it more automatic and resilient to the intense shame that can arise. Goal: Introduce a sense of mastery and reliability.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a very short rehearsal to help solidify the practice. Can you take a minute to imagine yourself in a moment when the shame hits, and you're feeling overwhelmed. As you feel the physical sensations, press your thumb to your wrist, take a slow breath, and say "I'm doing my best" out loud, twice. Repeat this process 5-7 times, focusing on the physical sensations and the sound of your own voice. After this, take a moment to notice how you feel. Does the phrase feel more powerful, or more manageable?

Patient: Okay — I did it, about six times like you said. At first the words felt flat and hollow, my jaw stayed clenched and my breath was shallow, and that hot shame kept flaring so I kept getting distracted and anxious. By the fourth or fifth time, my breath loosened a hair, the phrase sounded a little less like a script and more like… something real, but it’s tiny. I’m still skeptical — it steadied me for a few seconds, then the head-started-to-race feeling came back — so I want help making this actually stick: pick the single most reliable nudge for me and slow down so we rehearse that exact sequence until it feels automatic. How is that supposed to help long-term? I don’t know, but I’ll try if we practice it properly.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've experienced the initial resistance to the practice, but noticed a small glimmer of progress. The challenge is to help you build on this small success and create a long-term habit. Goal: Introduce a sense of consistency and habituation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down and rehearse the exact sequence until it feels automatic. I want you to repeat the sequence 3-4 times a day, at the same times, so that it becomes a habit. For example, right as you're getting ready for your first client, before you open your laptop, or just as you're sitting down. Take a slow breath, press your thumb to your wrist, and say "I'm doing my best" out loud, twice. We'll focus on the physical sensations, the sound of your own voice, and the feeling of the phrase becoming more real and natural. Can you commit to this daily practice for the next week, and see how it goes?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it for a week. I’ll do the thumb-to-wrist + one slow breath + “I’m doing my best” before my first client, before lunch, and before my last one each day, and set a phone alarm 2 minutes beforehand. I’m really skeptical it’ll stick when that hot shame hits and my jaw clamps, so I want a midweek check-in and a simple backup plan — like a 30-second “rescue” script you give me if I miss it — because I know I’ll mess up and then beat myself up. Can we slow down and pick that rescue line now so I don’t have to invent it while panicking?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've committed to a daily practice, and are now looking for a backup plan to help you cope with the possibility of missing a step. The challenge is to find a simple, powerful rescue line that can help you defuse the shame and get back on track. Goal: Introduce a sense of resilience and support.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore a few options for a rescue line that can help you cope with the shame and get back to the practice. Here are a few ideas to get started: "I've got this", "One breath at a time", "It's okay, I'm okay", or "I'll come back to it". Take a moment to think about which one feels most natural and empowering to you. If none of these resonate, we can work on creating a new one together. Remember, the goal is to find something that can help you feel more grounded and calm, rather than triggering more shame or anxiety.

Patient: Okay — I’ll take "One breath at a time" as the rescue line, though honestly how is that supposed to help when my jaw clamps and the shame goes hot? I want a very short, exact rescue script I can read on a sticky note: "Pause. Thumb to wrist. Breathe in 4, out 6. Say out loud twice: 'I'm doing my best.' One more slow breath, then continue." Can we rehearse that now a couple of times and schedule a midweek check-in? I'm nervous it'll feel hollow, but I’ll try if we practice it properly.

Therapist Thinking:
You've created a clear, concise rescue script that includes a physical cue, a breath, and a statement that affirms your effort. The challenge is to rehearse it until it feels automatic and natural. Goal: Introduce a sense of mastery and confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's rehearse the rescue script a few times. Take a deep breath in, and say it out loud: "Pause. Thumb to wrist. Breathe in 4, out 6. Say out loud twice: 'I'm doing my best.' One more slow breath, then continue." Repeat it a few times, focusing on the physical sensations, the sound of your own voice, and the words becoming more familiar. When you're ready, we'll schedule a midweek check-in to see how it's going. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience.

Patient: Alright — I rehearsed it out loud three times just now: thumb to wrist, breathe in 4/out 6, “I’m doing my best” twice, one more slow breath. It steadied me a hair, but halfway through that hot shame flared and I got pissed at myself — jaw clenched, breath shallow, hands fidgety — so I’m skeptical it’ll stick. I’ll try the daily routine for a week, but I want a midweek check-in — can we do Wednesday at 2pm? And if I miss a practice, give me a super-short backup I can read fast: “Pause. Breathe. I’m doing my best.” Can we slow down now and run through that exact sequence one more time together so I don’t mess it up when I panic?
