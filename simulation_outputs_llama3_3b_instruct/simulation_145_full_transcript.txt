--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in this pattern where I use procrastination to avoid dealing with grief from losing someone, and it's gotten worse since I started a demanding new program. I'm unemployed otherwise, so I fill my time with busywork that feels productive but really just keeps me from feeling anything. I don't know, it's awkward to talk about and I guess I worry it's making things worse.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be shame and discomfort when discussing the grief and feeling overwhelmed by it. A specific theme that emerges is the avoidance of processing your emotions and the conflicting desire to feel productive and fulfilled. A key area to explore is the function of using busywork as a means to cope with your grief. Your goal is to Explore the tangible context of "stuck" to identify potential areas for committed action.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe what it's like when you're in the middle of a task that feels like busywork – do you ever notice that you're not really engaging with the task itself, but rather just going through the motions?

Patient: Yeah, it's like I'm on autopilot—I pick small, "productive" things and keep checking them off without actually thinking about them. I guess those tasks let me avoid the grief, but mostly I'm just going through the motions and feeling kind of numb. I don't know, it's awkward to say that out loud and I don't really know how to stop.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is caught in a cycle of avoidance, using busywork to numb themselves to their grief, and seems uncertain about how to stop. A key area to explore is the role of social norms and the sense of awkwardness associated with acknowledging emotional pain. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by gently reframing the language and introducing a willingness to explore alternative approaches.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to defuse the discomfort around admitting that you're using busywork as a way to avoid your emotions. Instead of saying "I'm avoiding my grief," can you say to yourself "I'm using these tasks as a way to take my mind off things right now"? What might happen if, instead of trying to avoid your emotions, you were to approach them with a sense of curiosity, like "What's going on when I feel numb or overwhelmed?"

Patient: Okay, I can say, "I'm using these tasks as a way to take my mind off things right now" — I guess saying it out loud makes it more real. Maybe if I actually got curious I'd notice what's under the numbness, like being tired, guilty, or just really scared. I don't know, it feels risky to go there; I usually just distract myself because it feels safer.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is starting to acknowledge the role of avoidance and is considering the possibility of exploring their emotions. A specific area to explore is the underlying fear of uncertainty and discomfort associated with confronting their emotions. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, exploring the potential benefits of embracing the unknown.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge that you're using distraction as a way to avoid uncertainty. Can you think of a small, low-stakes situation where you might be willing to explore what's under the numbness, even if it feels scary? For example, when was the last time you noticed what you were feeling in a moment when you weren't trying to distract yourself?

Patient: I guess a low-stakes moment could be when I'm making tea—I could sit with the cup for a couple minutes and try to notice what's happening. Last night after getting a disappointing email, I sat on the couch and felt a tightness in my chest and this hollow sadness, but I started doing the dishes to not feel it. I don't know, it still feels risky to actually stay with that stuff.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is considering a small, low-stakes moment to explore their emotions, and is recognizing the pattern of avoidance that led to distraction in the dishwashing scenario. A key area to explore is the concept of "staying with the discomfort" and the potential benefits of gradual exposure to difficult emotions. Your goal is to Gently challenge the workability of this strategy, encouraging the patient to reconsider the potential outcomes of staying with their emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to reframe your experience with the tightness and hollow sadness after the disappointing email. Instead of saying "I was overwhelmed and avoided the feeling," can you say to yourself "I'm noticing a physical sensation in my chest and a feeling of sadness – it's like my body is trying to tell me something"? What might happen if, instead of avoiding it, you were to stay with the sensation for just a few more breaths, without trying to distract yourself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I stayed with it for a few more breaths it might get louder at first, like that tightness would sharpen. Maybe after a minute it would ease or at least I'd know what I'm actually feeling instead of the fog. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed just talking about it — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is considering the potential benefits of staying with their emotions, but is feeling overwhelmed by the thought of exploring them further. A key area to explore is the patient's relationship with their emotional tolerance and the need for a gentle and gradual approach. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, encouraging the patient to re-evaluate their expectations and boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to slow down. Let's take a break if you need to. Take a deep breath with me and when you're ready, we can come back to this. No pressure. Would you be willing to take a few more deep breaths with me, and when you're feeling more centered, we can try to explore this further at your pace?

Patient: Okay, I'll try taking a few deep breaths with you now. I did three slow ones and I feel a tiny bit steadier but also kind of shaky—I don't know, it brings up a lot. Can we go slower? I guess maybe just notice the chest tightness for one breath and then pause, if that's okay.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking small steps towards increasing their emotional tolerance, and is seeking a more gradual approach. A key area to explore is the patient's relationship with their emotional boundaries and the need for a more incremental pace. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by focusing on the immediate experience and acknowledging the patient's boundaries.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the chest tightness for just one breath. Notice it for this one breath, and as you exhale, pause for a moment before taking the next breath. What's the sensation like in that one breath? (pause)

Patient: It's a tight, shallow pressure across my chest, like someone's tightening a belt; when I exhaled it eased a little but my heart was kinda racing. I don't know, I guess it feels weird and exposed to actually pay attention to it. Can we slow down and do one more breath like that?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is becoming more aware of their physical sensations and is starting to experience a sense of vulnerability in acknowledging them. A key area to explore is the patient's relationship with vulnerability and the potential benefits of accepting their emotions as they are. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, encouraging the patient to build confidence in their ability to tolerate difficult emotions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one more breath together. Notice the sensation in your chest, and as you exhale, pause again before taking the next breath. This time, I want you to add a slight phrase to yourself as you breathe out: "I am here with this feeling." Can you try that for one breath?

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I breathed out and said "I am here with this feeling." For that exhale the tightness eased a little, but then I felt kind of raw and wanted to look away or do something busy to avoid it. I don't know, it feels risky to stay with it; can we go slower and try one more really short breath like that? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a mix of relief and discomfort in the face of vulnerability, and is struggling with the idea of staying with their emotions. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to recognize and tolerate their emotions as they arise, rather than trying to avoid or escape them. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by focusing on the immediate experience and encouraging the patient to develop a sense of acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take one more super-short breath. Just breathe in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am here with this feeling" again. This time, don't worry about the sensation or the outcome – just focus on the words and the breath. Can you do that for just one tiny breath?

Patient: Okay, I did that tiny breath and said the phrase. For a second the tightness loosened, but then a hollow sort of sadness came up and I felt this urge to get up and do something busy instead. I don't know, I guess can we just keep going slower—maybe one more really slow breath?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a natural shift in emotional tone and is struggling with the urge to escape or avoid the sadness that has arisen. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to recognize and tolerate the full range of their emotions, rather than trying to escape or suppress them. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by focusing on the immediate experience and encouraging the patient to develop a sense of acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another tiny breath, and this time, as you exhale, can you say to yourself "I am here with this feeling" again? But this time, also add a small phrase that acknowledges the sadness: "I am here with this feeling and this sadness too." Take your time, and just breathe with those words.

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I breathed out and said "I am here with this feeling and this sadness too." For a moment the sadness felt bigger, like a hollow under the tightness, and my eyes started to sting; I don't know, it feels raw and exposed. I guess can we slow down — maybe just sit in silence for a minute or have me name one small thing I can see in the room before we try another breath? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a significant emotional shift, and is struggling with the sensation of vulnerability and exposure. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to tolerate the full range of their emotions, including the raw and potentially painful feelings that have arisen. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by focusing on the immediate experience and encouraging the patient to develop a sense of acceptance.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to take a break and sit in silence for a minute. Just be with the sensations in your body and the thoughts in your mind. When you're ready, we can continue. For now, take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you name one small thing you can see in the room, like a chair or a picture on the wall?

Patient: I can see a chipped blue mug on the side table. Noticing it makes me feel a tiny bit steadier, but my chest's still tight and I don't know what's next.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to focus on a concrete object and find some temporary stability, but still experiences physical tension and uncertainty. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to develop a sense of curiosity and interest in their emotions, rather than simply trying to avoid or escape them. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by encouraging the patient to approach their emotions with a sense of openness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to look at the chipped blue mug some more. Notice the color, the shape, the texture of the ceramic. Can you describe it to yourself, just for a moment, without judgment? What words come to mind when you think of this mug?

Patient: It's a chipped blue mug—dull cobalt with the glaze worn thin in spots, a small jagged chip on the rim and a faint coffee ring inside. It's squat and a bit heavy, the handle fits my fingers the way a familiar thing should. Words that come to mind: worn, steady, ordinary, a little sad. I don't know, noticing it calms me a bit, but I guess I'm nervous about getting into what it might remind me of.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to develop a sense of curiosity and interest in the object, and is able to acknowledge the complex emotions that arise in response. A key area to explore is the patient's relationship with nostalgia and the potential triggers that come with it. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, encouraging the patient to approach their emotions with a sense of curiosity and openness.

Therapist Answer:
The words "ordinary" and "sad" come up, suggesting that the mug may be a trigger for your grief. Can you explore this further? What is it about this mug that feels ordinary, but also sad? Is it the fact that it's a familiar object, or the fact that it's worn and faded?

Patient: I guess it's ordinary because it's always been there — a small, steady thing that doesn’t demand much and feels familiar. But it's sad because it's worn and chipped, and looking at it brings up this shame and frustration, like I haven’t kept things together—I don't know, that feeling actually stings. I'm getting kind of uncomfortable going deeper right now; can we slow down or maybe talk about one small thing I could do when that feeling comes up instead of immediately distracting myself?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is exploring the complex emotions associated with the mug and is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the depth of their exploration. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to develop a sense of self-compassion and understanding when experiencing difficult emotions, rather than avoidance or self-criticism. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by encouraging the patient to develop a sense of kindness towards themselves.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay to take a step back and prioritize your comfort. We can definitely slow down. One small thing you could do when that feeling of shame and frustration comes up is take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. You can say to yourself "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." How does that feel?

Patient: I don't know — saying "I'm doing the best I can" feels oddly true but also makes this hot shame flare up, like I'm being reminded of everything I haven't managed. I guess breathing and saying it helps a little, but I immediately want to shove the feeling away by doing something busy to prove I'm not failing. Can we slow down and come up with one very small, concrete thing I can do in that moment—like a 2-minute grounding task—so I don't just default to distracting myself?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing a strong reaction to the phrase "I'm doing the best I can," which is causing shame and a desire to escape. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to develop a sense of self-compassion and understand that shame can be a catalyst for growth. Your goal is to Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) by introducing a concrete, actionable step that encourages the patient to engage with their emotions in a more mindful way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on a 2-minute grounding task to help you feel more grounded and centered when you're feeling overwhelmed. When that shame and frustration come up again, take 2 minutes to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the sounds around you. That's it – just notice these things for 2 minutes without trying to change or distract yourself. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay, I can try that — I'll give it two minutes. When the shame and frustration hit I get this urgent need to prove I'm not failing, so I usually jump into busywork; I don't know if just noticing my feet and the air will be enough. I'm a little scared it'll just make the shame louder, so can we agree on a tiny follow-up, like you checking in for 30 seconds afterward if it feels overwhelming?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing the pattern of using busywork as a way to cope with shame and frustration, and is concerned that simply noticing their feet and the air might not be enough. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to develop a sense of self-compassion and understanding that their emotions are valid, rather than trying to suppress or escape them. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, encouraging the patient to approach their emotions with a sense of curiosity and openness.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to give this a try. We can definitely agree on a follow-up check-in. Let's aim to check in with each other in 30 seconds after you've finished the 2-minute grounding task. If you're feeling overwhelmed, you can signal to me, and we can come back to it together. How does that sound?

Patient: I don't know, I guess that sounds okay — I'll try the 2 minutes and wait for your 30‑second check-in. I'm already bracing though; there's this sharp shame/annoyance that tells me I'll just bail and do something busy instead, so if it gets overwhelming can we switch to a 30‑second concrete task (like naming five things I can touch) instead of staying with it?

The patient is bracing themselves for the potential discomfort of staying with their emotions, and is looking for a Plan B to cope with overwhelming feelings. A key area to explore is the patient's ability to develop a sense of flexibility and adaptability in the face of uncertainty. Your goal is to Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, encouraging the patient to approach their emotions with a sense of curiosity and openness.

Therapist Answer:
I completely understand. If you find that the 2-minute grounding task becomes overwhelming, we can definitely switch to a 30-second concrete task like naming five things you can touch. Let's agree that if you need to switch, you can signal to me, and we'll pivot to the 30-second task. For now, let's start the 2-minute grounding task. Take a deep breath and begin.

Patient: Okay—I took a deep breath and tried to start, but my mind just jumped around and I feel suddenly anxious and distracted; my hands are a bit shaky. I don't know, I guess I'm bracing for it to get worse, so can we switch to the 30‑second task now and I'll name five things I can touch? I'm already worried I'll bail, so please check in after.

Therapist Answer:
I completely understand. It's okay to switch to the 30-second task. Let's take a deep breath and start fresh. I'll check in with you in 30 seconds. When you're ready, just start naming five things you can touch – it's a very simple and low-stakes task. Remember, there's no right or wrong, just your voice and your fingers. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

Patient: Okay—I'll try. Um… the chipped blue mug, the couch fabric under my hand, the wooden edge of the side table, my sweatshirt sleeve, and the carpet by my foot. I don't know, my hands are really shaky and my mind keeps jumping around — I guess I'm already worrying I'll bail and do something busy instead. Can you check in in 30 seconds like we planned?
