Patient: Lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends and even family because social situations make me unbearably anxious, and it’s only gotten worse since the house emptied out. I've been a manager my whole life, very analytical and cautious, and honestly I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried things before and they didn't work, so how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you think of a specific social gathering or situation where your anxiety was most overwhelming? What was it about that situation that felt unbearable, and what do you think you were trying to avoid or protect yourself from?

Patient: There was a dinner a few weeks ago for my daughter's friends—everyone was talking, laughing, and I just froze, my chest got tight and I couldn't think of anything to say. It felt unbearable because I was convinced they were judging me as out-of-touch or awkward, and I think I was trying to protect myself from being embarrassed or having a panic attack. I've gone over this before with other people — how is talking about it now supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that opening up about your anxiety might lead to more judgment or embarrassment. Would it be helpful to explore the possibility that your friends' reactions might be different from what you expect, and that they might actually be more understanding and supportive?

Patient: Maybe in theory, but I've tried telling myself they're understanding and it doesn't stop the panic. How is picturing them as supportive supposed to change the tightness in my chest or the mind-blanking? I want something that actually helps me manage the sensations in the moment, not just reassurance.

Therapist: Let's try something different. When you notice your chest getting tight and your mind going blank, can you simply observe those physical sensations as they are, without trying to change or fight them, just for a moment? Notice the sensations in your body, without judgment, and see if that might help create a bit of space?

Patient: Okay... I'll try that. Right now my chest feels like a tight band, my hands tingle, and my thoughts just go blank. When I try to notice it, it often feels like it gets louder—like I'm giving it attention and making it worse. How is just observing supposed to actually calm me in the moment?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to stop the physical sensations or thoughts entirely, but rather to be willing to experience them as they are, without judgment or resistance. Think of it like this: what if, instead of trying to push away the sensations, you simply allowed them to be present, without trying to change them? What would it be like to approach this tightness in your chest with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to escape or fight it?

Patient: I can try being curious, but honestly it feels counterintuitive—when I focus on it my chest tightens more and my thoughts just vanish. If we're going to do this, tell me what "observe without judging" actually looks like in practice, because vague instructions haven't helped me before.

Therapist: Let's try a simple exercise. When you notice your chest tightening, I want you to say to yourself: "This is a sensation in my body" - just those three words. No more, no less. No interpretation, no judgment, no trying to change it. Just say those three words, and then let the sensation be. What do you think it would be like to say those words without adding anything else to the sentence?

Patient: Alright—I'll try it: "This is a sensation in my body." Saying it actually makes me more aware and, if anything, my chest feels tighter and my thoughts speed up — labeling it seems to make it louder. I've tried stuff like this before and it usually doesn't help; how is repeating that supposed to actually reduce the tightness?

Therapist: I can see that you're skeptical about the effectiveness of this exercise. But what if, instead of trying to reduce the tightness, we looked at what's driving it? What values are at stake for you in feeling calm and in social situations? Is it about feeling comfortable, being liked, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's mostly about competence and not looking foolish — after managing things my whole life, I don't want to show up and seem irrelevant or out of touch. There's also a part of me that wants connection so I'm not just... empty, now that the kids are gone. But seriously, how is naming those values supposed to stop my chest from tightening? I've tried using values as motivation before and it doesn't calm me down.

Therapist: Those values of competence and connection make sense. I'm not suggesting that naming them will magically calm your chest, but perhaps we can explore how they relate to the tightness in a different way. What would it be like to approach your anxiety about appearing incompetent or out of touch as a chance to show up more fully, rather than trying to control or hide it?

Patient: That sounds... fine in theory, but in practice "showing up fully" feels like an invitation to be judged — I've tried being more open and it just left me embarrassed. How is that supposed to help with the immediate chest-tightening and mind-blanking when I'm actually in the room? I need something concrete and step-by-step to try next time, because vague advice hasn't worked for me.

Therapist: Let's try a specific step you can take in the next social gathering: as soon as you notice your chest tightening, pause for 5-10 seconds before responding to a question or making a comment. During that pause, take a few deep breaths and say to yourself: "I am here, I am present, and I am enough." This small pause can give you a chance to gather yourself before responding, and the words can help you connect with your values of competence and connection.

Patient: Alright — I'll try pausing for 5–10 seconds and saying "I am here, I am present, and I am enough," though it already feels awkward and I'm not convinced a mantra will stop the chest tightening. My real worry is that the silence will draw attention and make me freeze even more; how is standing quiet supposed to keep my mind from blanking when everyone looks at me? If that doesn't help, what exact, in-the-moment thing can I do instead — not vague reassurance, but a step-by-step move?

Therapist: Instead of pausing and saying the mantra, what if, when you notice your mind-blanking, you simply say "um" or "hmm" to acknowledge the pause, and then take a small action that doesn't require responding, like shifting your weight, clearing your throat, or making a slight physical movement? This can create a small buffer between you and the expectation to respond immediately, giving you a chance to collect yourself.

Patient: Yeah... I guess saying "um" and shifting my weight might be less weird than a full silence, so I can try that — but won't that still make people notice and make me freeze more? If that doesn't work, what's the exact fallback I should do in the moment — a specific tiny movement or phrase? Honestly, I'm running on empty and even thinking about this feels like a big effort.

Therapist: What if, when you notice your mind-blanking, you simply open your mouth slightly and take a tiny breath, just a tiny, almost imperceptible movement, and say "I'm...". Just that simple, tiny action, and let it drop. It's so small that it's almost impossible to notice, and it can help create a tiny buffer between you and the expectation to respond.

Patient: Okay... I can try the tiny "I'm..." — it feels less conspicuous than an "um." But how is that supposed to stop my chest from tightening or my mind from blanking when everyone's looking? If that fails, what's the immediate fallback—do I just let it drop, or quietly excuse myself for a moment?

Therapist: If the "I'm..." doesn't work, and you feel like you're about to freeze, what if, instead of letting it drop or excusing yourself, you simply acknowledge the physical sensation in your chest by saying "My chest is tight" or "My heart is beating fast" - just a simple, factual statement that brings attention to your physical experience without drawing attention to yourself. This can help you stay present with your body and avoid the need to respond immediately.

Patient: Okay—saying “My chest is tight” could be less performative, but won’t that just make people stare and make me feel worse? If that fails, give me one really concrete fallback: do I quietly step away to the bathroom, or is there a tiny phrase or movement that’s least likely to draw attention? I’m running on empty thinking through options, so please keep it simple.

Therapist: If everything else fails, and you feel like you're about to freeze, what if you simply step away to the bathroom for a minute to collect yourself? It's a very low-key action that won't draw attention, and you can take a minute to regroup without having to do anything more than breathe.

Patient: Okay... I can try slipping to the bathroom, but won't that just look like I'm avoiding everyone? If I'm going to do that, give me one specific thing to do in there for 60 seconds — should I focus on slow breaths, splash cold water, or repeat "This is a sensation in my body"? And how long is too long before it starts to seem obvious? I'm running on empty thinking through options, so keep it simple.

Therapist: In the bathroom, try focusing on the sensation of your feet on the ground, noticing the feeling of your feet touching the floor, and the sensation of the air on your skin. Simply observe this sensation without trying to change it or add anything to it. This can help you focus on the present moment and reduce feelings of overwhelm.

Patient: Okay... I can try focusing on my feet for about 60 seconds — honestly even that feels like a lot right now. How is paying attention to my feet supposed to make the tightness in my chest ease up? And if there’s no bathroom nearby, what’s the least obvious thing I can do instead without making a scene?

Therapist: If you can't make it to the bathroom, try standing still and taking a small, slow breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. This can help you stay present and focused on the physical sensation of the breath, without drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Okay... I can try the slow breath, but when my chest clamps down I barely get any air — how is that supposed to help in the moment? I'm running on empty with all these options; give me one tiny, exact fallback I can do in front of people that won't draw attention — tell me the step-by-step (one sentence max) so I can actually remember it when it happens.

Therapist: When your chest clamps down and you feel like you're going to freeze, take a small, slight expansion of your shoulders, like you're shrugging them ever so slightly, without looking around or acknowledging it to anyone.

Patient: Okay... I can try that tiny shoulder expansion, though it feels a bit silly. How is shrugging supposed to stop my chest from clamping or my mind from blanking, and how small should the movement be so nobody notices? If that doesn't work, give me one simple one-sentence fallback I can remember when I'm running on empty.

Therapist: If all else fails, simply say "Okay" under your breath, with your mouth closed, without looking up or acknowledging it to anyone.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "Okay" under my breath feels like it'll do nothing. How is that supposed to stop my chest from tightening or my mind from going blank when everyone's looking? I'm running on empty just keeping up with all these options; give me one tiny, obvious thing I can actually remember that won't look weird.

Therapist: If all else fails, simply nod your head slightly to acknowledge the pause, without saying a word or drawing attention to yourself.

Patient: Yeah... a tiny nod. I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to stop my chest from clamping or my mind from going blank? I'm running on empty and my hands are tingling again; give me one ultra-simple, one-word cue or tiny movement I can actually remember and do without drawing attention.

Therapist: "Pause."

Patient: "Pause"... saying a word under my breath feels pointless — I've tried one-word cues before and it didn't stop the chest tightening. My hands are tingling and I'm running on empty; tell me exactly how to say it and what tiny physical move to pair with it so it'll actually steady me without anyone noticing. Give me one single, one-sentence instruction I can memorize and use when it starts, please.

Therapist: When you feel your chest tightening, say "pause" under your breath and subtly tilt your head to the right, keeping your eyes on the person speaking to you.

Patient: Okay... I can try that, though I'm skeptical. How quietly do I say "pause" — literally whisper it under my breath or just mouth it? And how small is a "subtle" tilt — barely move the chin to the right or a bigger lean? My hands are tingling and I'm running on empty, so give me one exact, one-line instruction I can actually remember and do without looking odd.

Therapist: Say "pause" very softly, almost inaudibly, and subtly tilt your chin up slightly, just enough to look like you're listening, without moving your head or eyes.

Patient: Okay... I can try, but I'm confused — you said tilt right earlier and now chin up; which one do I actually use? My hands are tingling and I'm running on empty, so give me one exact, one-line instruction (the exact word and the exact tiny movement) I can actually remember.

Therapist: Say "pause" very softly and tilt your chin to the right.

Patient: Alright... I'll try saying "pause" very softly and tilt my chin to the right, though I'm not convinced it'll stop the tightness. How small exactly — just a barely noticeable tilt, or something a little more obvious? And if that doesn't work, give me one tiny, one-line thing to say as I quietly step away so it doesn't feel like I'm running.

Therapist: Tilt your chin to your shoulder, just enough to look like you're listening, but not so much that it's noticeable. If that doesn't work, say "I need a drink" as you quietly step away from the conversation.

Patient: Alright... I'll try saying "pause" very softly and tilt my chin to my shoulder, though I'm not convinced it'll stop the tightness. If I step away and say "I need a drink," how long can I be gone before people notice? My hands are tingling again and I feel kind of worn out.

Therapist: Try to step away for about 15-30 seconds, just long enough to collect yourself, and then return to the conversation, all while saying "I need a drink" very softly.

Patient: Okay... I'll try saying "I need a drink" and slipping away for 15–30 seconds, though I'm not convinced that won't just look like avoidance. My hands are tingling and I'm running on empty, so give me one exact, one-step thing to do in that time—like "take five slow belly breaths"—that I can actually remember and do; which single action should I do? And honestly, how is that supposed to help the tightness right now?

Therapist: Take 5 slow, deep belly breaths as you step away, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce physical tension.

Patient: Okay... I can try taking five slow belly breaths when I slip away, but honestly when my chest clamps I can hardly get air — shallow breaths feel useless. Tell me exactly: inhale for 4 seconds and exhale for 6, or just whatever fits? If that still doesn't work, what's the single next tiny thing I should do in those 15–30 seconds? My hands are tingling and this already feels like a lot.

Therapist: Inhale for 3 seconds, hold for 2 seconds, and exhale for 5 seconds, then take a few more deep breaths. If that doesn't work, as you step away, make a slight, tiny touch to your nose or wrist with your index finger.

Patient: Ugh... my hands are tingling again and my chest feels like it's squeezing—I'm running on empty here. How is touching my wrist supposed to stop that? If I can only pick one single thing to actually remember and do when it hits, tell me that exact one-line instruction right now—no extras.
