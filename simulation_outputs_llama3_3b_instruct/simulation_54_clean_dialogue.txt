Patient: I've been feeling on edge since I started this new, demanding program — small interactions make me furious before I even realize it. I snap or shut down, then I'm left feeling ashamed and useless, which just makes the anxiety worse. I don't know, I guess I'm worried I'll mess everything up.

Therapist: Can you describe a specific situation that triggered your feeling of being on edge and furious during the program? What was happening just before you snapped or shut down?

Patient: Yeah — last week in a group critique I was trying to explain a piece I'd been working on for weeks, and the instructor cut me off mid-sentence to point out a tiny technical thing. Someone snickered, and I felt this hot rush of anger like my chest was a fist. I either shot back with a sarcastic little line or I clammed up and left the room — I don't know, I guess I felt ridiculous and invisible, like being older made my ideas less valid.

Therapist: It sounds like you felt like your experience and contributions weren't valued. Can you tell me more about what happened when you felt the instructor cut you off? What was the instructor's intention behind that comment, and how did it affect your sense of being seen and heard?

Patient: They cut me off when I was explaining why I chose the colors and composition — they pointed out a tiny technical thing like it was the only thing that mattered. I don't know if they meant to be helpful or just blunt, but it landed like they were dismissing the whole point of what I was trying to say. I guess that made me feel invisible and foolish, like my experience didn't count, and then I either snapped or shut down.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to share your ideas and work in a group setting. What would it mean to you if the instructor were to acknowledge and value your contributions, even if they're not perfect? What would that look like, and how might that change your experience of being in that group?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if the instructor actually acknowledged my ideas it would feel like my experience still matters, like I'm not just some older person taking up space. I'd probably feel less defensive and more willing to explain, and maybe less ashamed when I get angry. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Rather than getting stuck on the "if-then" scenario, can you just observe what's happening in the present moment when you feel like your ideas aren't valued? What physical sensations arise in your body, and what thoughts run through your mind? Sometimes, noticing the immediate experience can help us begin to detach from the emotional charge associated with it.

Patient: Physically my chest tightens, my face heats up, my jaw clenches and my hands go shaky. Thoughts leap in — "they think I'm ridiculous," "I'm too old for this," "I'll mess everything up" — and then I either snap or I shut down. I don't know, I guess noticing that stuff is really uncomfortable… can we slow down a bit? I'm not sure how to stay with it.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together, and let's just focus on the sensation of your hands feeling shaky. Notice the sensation of your fingers trembling, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, and the sensation of your feet touching the ground. We're just going to stay with this physical sensation, without trying to change it or analyze it.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying. My hands are still shaking but I can feel the little tremor at the tips of my fingers and the air going in and out — my breath is shallow though and my chest's tight. Thoughts keep barging in like "they think I'm ridiculous" and then I want to get up and leave or snap, I don't know, I guess this is really uncomfortable — can we slow down? Maybe tell me what to do when this hits in the middle of a critique.

Therapist: I'd like to propose a simple exercise to help you develop some space when you feel like your thoughts are taking over. When you notice those thoughts, like "they think I'm ridiculous," instead of trying to push them away or react, can you try saying to yourself, "This thought is present, but I'm not my thoughts"? Say it to yourself with kindness and curiosity, and then take a deep breath, noticing how your body feels in this moment. No effort, no resistance, just presence.

Patient: Okay, I tried saying that to myself and breathing, but it felt a bit hollow — the heat in my chest was still there and the thoughts kept barging back in. I don't know, I guess when I'm actually in the room with people it's like there's no time for a sentence to myself. Can you give me something really quick I can do in a second without anyone noticing?

Therapist: Can you try taking a micro-slip of time, just a tiny pause, before responding in the critique? Take a brief pause (about 1-2 seconds) and say to yourself, "I'm going to speak up" or "I'm going to share my idea". This small action can help you establish a sense of control and create a tiny gap between your thoughts and your reaction, giving you more space to respond more mindfully.

Patient: I can try that, but in the moment everything gets loud and fast and I either snap or I bolt — I don't know, I guess I'm worried a pause will just feel like freezing. Maybe give me one tiny, invisible thing I can do — like a word to whisper to myself or a fingertip press — something I can actually practice so it's automatic.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny, invisible gesture that you can do discreetly. Can you press the tip of your index finger against your thumb, just for a brief moment? It's a very small action, not noticeable to others, but it can help you build a tiny sense of control and awareness. Try to make it a habit by doing it immediately before responding in the critique, and see if it helps you feel more grounded.

Patient: Okay — I tried it in my head just now, pressing my finger to my thumb, and it did take the edge off a little, like a tiny anchor. But when I'm actually in the room it's all rush and shame and I don't know if my hand will move — I guess I'm afraid it'll feel silly or I'll forget. Can we work out a simple rehearsal I can do at home so it becomes automatic, or something even less noticeable if that one feels too clumsy?

Therapist: Let's do a simple, 5-second exercise at home. Next time you find yourself feeling anxious or reacting impulsively, press the tip of your index finger against the edge of your desk or a piece of paper for exactly 5 seconds. Just that brief, tiny touch can help you connect with the physical sensation and build confidence in your ability to pause.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — pressing my finger for five seconds. I did it once at home and it helped a tiny bit, but I'm worried I'll freeze or forget it in the moment, or it'll feel silly under the table. I don't know, I guess could we rehearse a very simple practice I can do a few times a day so it becomes automatic? Also, is there an even less noticeable place to press, like my inner thigh under the table?

Therapist: Let's focus on a very subtle and private location. Instead of pressing your finger on the desk, try pressing the inside of your upper thigh, just for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds). It's a very private area that's not likely to be noticed by others. Let's aim to do this 5 times a day, ideally at the same time each day, so it becomes a habitual cue. Can you commit to doing this daily practice and see how it goes?

Patient: Okay, I can try — I'll aim to do it five times a day, but I don't know if I'll remember in the moment; I guess I'm worried it'll feel silly or I'll freeze. Can we rehearse it now a couple times so it feels less awkward? And if the thigh press still feels weird, can we pick an even smaller cue I can use when I'm standing or my hands are busy?

Therapist: Let's do a quick rehearsal to help you feel more comfortable with the thigh press. As we practice, I'll give you a gentle reminder to press your inner thigh, and we'll focus on the sensation of the touch. When I say "press", press your inner thigh for just a second, and then release. Let's do it a few times, and I'll gradually reduce the number of reminders. If you're still feeling uneasy, we can explore even smaller cues, like a subtle blink or a tiny finger twitch.

Patient: Okay... I can try, but I'm nervous it'll feel stupid or I'll forget. Go ahead and say "press" and I'll do it — I don't know, I guess we'll see how it goes.

Therapist: Press.

Patient: Okay — I pressed. It felt like a tiny anchor, my breath eased a little but my chest's still hot and my hands are shaky. I don't know, I guess it helped a bit, but I'm afraid I'll forget or look silly — can we try that smaller blink or finger-twitch cue a couple times so it feels less awkward?

Therapist: Let's start with a very tiny finger twitch. Can you just twitch the tip of your index finger for a fraction of a second, without even thinking about it? Just a tiny, almost imperceptible movement. We'll try it a few times, and I'll focus on the sensation of the movement, not the intention behind it.

Patient: Okay — I tried the twitch a couple times. It felt silly but it did take a notch off the heat in my chest and my breath got a little steadier, though my hands are still shaky. I don't know, I guess I'm afraid I'll freeze or it will look odd in front of others. Can we do it a few more times, maybe while I picture being back in that critique so it feels less abstract?

Therapist: Let's try it while visualizing the critique again. Imagine you're in that situation, and you twitch your index finger just a fraction of a second before responding. Try it a few times, and focus on the physical sensation of the twitch, rather than the thought behind it. As you do this, I want you to notice how your body feels in the present moment, and how your reactions change.

Patient: Okay... I tried it in the critique in my head a few times — just a tiny twitch before I spoke. It took the edge off a little, like the rush loosened for a second, but my chest's still tight and my jaw's clenched and my hands shake. I don't know, I guess it helps in the rehearsal, but when I picture them laughing or cutting me off it still feels huge. Can we do one more slow round of the twitch practice, maybe with you timing me, so it doesn't feel so abstract?

Therapist: Let's do one more round of the twitch practice, this time with me providing a gentle reminder. I'll say "twitch" when you're ready to go, and you can just twitch your index finger for a fraction of a second. Ready? I'll say "twitch" in 3... 2... 1...

Patient: Okay... I twitched when you said it. It eased the rush a little but my chest's still tight and I feel kind of worn out — I don't know, I guess can we do it one more time, but slower?

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. I'll say "twitch" again, and you can just twitch your index finger for the briefest moment. Ready? I'll say "twitch" in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

Patient: Okay... I twitched when you said it. It helped a little—the rush eased for a second—but my chest's still tight and I feel kind of wiped out. I don't know, I guess can we try one more, even slower, and maybe count together so it feels steadier?

Therapist: Let's try it again, even slower. I'll count down together: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... I'll say "twitch" when I reach 1. Just twitch your index finger as you hear "twitch".

Patient: Okay... I twitched when you said it. It eased the rush for a second but my chest's still tight and I feel kind of wiped out. I don't know, I guess can we do it again but with a cue I can use when I'm standing, or could you walk me through what to do if that tiny twitch doesn't work in the moment?

Therapist: Let's work on a new cue that you can use when you're standing. Instead of the twitch, try making a tiny, almost imperceptible movement with your nose. It's a very subtle action, and you can do it anywhere, anytime. When you feel the urge to react impulsively, just bring your nose to the side for a fraction of a second. Ready to try it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is moving my nose supposed to help with the rush? I can try, but my head's kind of fuzzy and I'm feeling wiped out. I don't know, I guess could you show me slowly or should we stick with the finger twitch?

Therapist: Let's stick with the finger twitch. Sometimes, simplicity is the best approach. Just focus on the twitch, and remember that it's a tiny, private action to help you pause and breathe. I'll support you in sticking with it, even if it feels fuzzy or challenging. Let's take a moment to rest and recharge before we continue.

Patient: Okay... I can try to rest for a minute, though my head's fuzzy and it all feels like a lot of effort. I don't know, I guess could we do one quick role-play now—like you cut me off and I try the twitch—so it feels more real? I'm worried I'll just freeze when it counts.

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. I'll interrupt you mid-sentence, just like I did in the critique. You'll respond as you normally would, and then you'll try the finger twitch. Ready? Here we go:

(I'll interrupt you) Excuse me, I think you're going off on a tangent. Let's focus on the main point.

(Remember to twitch your index finger)

Patient: Oh— I was trying to say "I wasn't..." and my face went hot and I almost snapped, but I stopped. I twitched my finger like you said and it loosened the rush for a second, though my chest's still tight and my hands are shaky. I don't know, I guess can we do that again but slower? I'm feeling kind of wiped out.

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. I'll interrupt you again, and you'll try the finger twitch. Remember to focus on the sensation of the twitch, and don't worry about what I say. Ready?

(I'll interrupt you) I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at, let's focus on the main point.

(Remember to twitch your index finger)

Patient: I was going to say "I wasn't—" and my face went hot and I nearly snapped, but I twitched like you said. It eased the rush for a breath or two, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaky. I don't know, I guess can we do it again but slower? I'm feeling kind of fuzzy and worn out.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and try again. Remember, I'm not judging you, and I'm just here to support you. When I say "twitch", just focus on the physical sensation of the movement. Ready?

(I'll interrupt you) You seem to be going off on a tangent, let's refocus.

(Remember to twitch your index finger)

Patient: I was going to say "I wasn't finished—" and my face went hot and I nearly snapped, but I twitched my finger when you said it. It took the edge off for a beat, but my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking and I feel kind of wiped out. I don't know, I guess can we slow down and figure out what to do if that little twitch doesn't work when I'm actually in the room? I'm worried I'll just freeze.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and explore some options. What would happen if the twitch didn't work in the moment? What other coping strategies have you found helpful in the past?

Patient: I don't know — if the twitch flops, I usually either freeze and can't say anything or my face heats up and I snap and then feel awful. I guess things that have helped a little before are slipping out for a quick breather, a rehearsed one-liner like "can I finish this?" or squeezing a little stress ball in my pocket, and counting slow breaths in my head, but I'm worried those all seem silly or I'll forget them when it matters. Can we... can we try figuring out a backup plan that feels less awkward?

Therapist: I think those coping strategies you mentioned can be helpful. Let's work on making them more accessible and automatic. For the one-liners, try rehearsing them in a low-stakes situation, like when you're walking down the street or waiting in line. For the stress ball, consider keeping one in your pocket or bag so it's always within reach. And for counting slow breaths, try practicing it when you're feeling calm, so it becomes a more automatic habit. Which of these strategies feels most promising to you, and how can we make them more accessible in the moment?

Patient: I think the one-liners and the stress ball feel the most doable. I could try rehearsing a couple of short lines—like "Can I finish this?" or "Just a sec, please"—out loud a few times a day and keep a small ball in my pocket so it's there if I freeze. I don't know, I guess I'm worried it'll still feel silly or I'll forget, but could we practice a couple of simple one-liners here now so they won't feel so awkward?

Therapist: Let's try a simple one-liner together. I'll start by saying "Excuse me, can I finish my thought?" and you respond with a brief pause and then "Just a sec, please". Remember to keep your finger twitch ready, just in case. Ready?

Patient: Just a sec, please.

I twitched my finger when I said it — felt a bit strange and small, but my chest eased a notch. I don't know, I guess can we try that again, but slower?
