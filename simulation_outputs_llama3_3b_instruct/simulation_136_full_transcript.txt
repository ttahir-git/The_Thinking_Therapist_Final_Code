--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — I'm a manager, but I can't see what matters to me beyond that role. Whenever I try to imagine a next step, my brain immediately spins a worst-case story: I try something different, I fail, my team notices, I get fired, I can't find another job, and the move I made ends up ruining everything. I know it sounds grim, but my mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster and I get totally hooked on those scenarios.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is describing a sense of being overwhelmed by catastrophic thinking. Core emotion is anxiety. One specific theme is the difficulty in imagining a positive outcome due to the overwhelming negative scenarios. Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you get caught up in these worst-case stories? What do you think would happen if you didn't have that inner critic, if you could just imagine a possible success or a neutral outcome without immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario?

Patient: When I get pulled into those stories my chest tightens and I basically freeze — I overthink every tiny decision, avoid doing anything that might change things, then beat myself up for being stuck. Imagining a neutral or successful outcome feels like lying to myself: my mind immediately spins it into a new disaster — I'll be exposed, people will notice I can't do it, I get fired, the move collapses everything — so I just don't believe other outcomes. I know people tell me to picture something else, but to me those alternate endings feel totally unrealistic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's avoidance behavior seems to be maintained by the fear of being exposed and the perceived loss of control. One specific unexplored area is the underlying value that might be driving this need for control. Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like having a sense of control and being able to make good decisions feels really important to you. What would having a sense of control and confidence in your abilities mean for you, personally?

Patient: I guess it would mean not feeling like I'm just surviving the job—being able to plan, try things, and have some part of my life that isn't just managing people. But every time I let myself imagine that, my brain goes straight to: I get complacent or exposed, people notice, I get fired, can't find another job, and the move I made blows up — so I can't really believe control would last.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's value of control is tied to a desire for autonomy and purpose beyond management, but this is complicated by the fear of failure and exposure. One specific strategy is the unworkability of the current avoidance behavior. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine having a small, tiny step, just a tiny experiment, where you allow yourself to consider what you'd like your ideal situation to look like, without immediately jumping to the worst-case scenarios? It might be as simple as taking 5 minutes to brainstorm a single possibility, without judging it or getting caught up in the catastrophic thinking.

Patient: I can't even sit with a five-minute brainstorm without my head shooting straight to disasters — I imagine being exposed, my team losing confidence, getting fired, and the move collapsing everything. It feels pointless to try because those scenarios feel inevitable, and I'm honestly overwhelmed by it all; can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to take even small steps due to the overwhelming sense of inevitability and catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the concept of defusion, separating the thought from the experience. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and say, "Your mind is having a conversation with you, and that conversation is having a lot of vivid details and a strong sense of certainty. Can you simply acknowledge that, without judgment or agreement? Just notice that your mind is having this conversation, and allow it to continue without getting caught up in it?"

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it, but the moment I call it "just a conversation" my mind screams that it's real — it outlines every mistake, says I'll try something, fail in front of my team, get fired, and the move will all fall apart. I can feel my chest tighten and I get totally hooked on arguing with it, not letting it just pass.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is getting caught up in the narrative and feeling like they're in a battle with their own mind. One specific theme is the tendency to engage with the thought as if it's true. Goal: Challenge the workability of this strategy.

Therapist Answer:
Can you pause for just one more moment, and instead of trying to convince your mind that it's just a conversation, what if you were to say to your mind, "I see that you're having a lot of ideas, but they're not necessarily true. What would happen if, instead of getting caught up in the story, you just took a tiny step towards something new, just a small action that felt slightly out of character for you?"

Patient: Okay, I'll try to picture taking one tiny, slightly out-of-character step, but the second I do my mind's already narrating the worst: I speak up, I stumble, my team loses confidence, they start noticing mistakes, HR gets involved, I'm fired, can't find another job here, and the move I made ends up ruining everything. I'm feeling really overwhelmed by that chain—can we slow down? I don't know how to believe a small step wouldn't set all of that off.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to imagine a small step that wouldn't lead to catastrophic consequences. One specific area to explore is the value of taking action despite uncertainty. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of one thing, just one small, tiny, almost ridiculously small thing you could do right now, in this moment, that has nothing to do with work or the worst-case scenario? For example, you could take a deep breath, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or say a kind word to someone in the room. What would happen if you simply allowed yourself to do that small thing, without trying to plan for every possible outcome?

Patient: I can try one slow deep breath and feel my feet on the floor for ten seconds. Even as I do it, my mind will be narrating that this calm is the setup for me to make a move, mess up, my team notices, HR gets involved, and the move collapses everything — so I'm already bracing for that. I'm willing to try it now, but honestly I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to take a small step, but is struggling with the idea that they can't escape the catastrophic thinking. One specific theme is the fear of being set up for failure. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the physical sensation of taking that deep breath. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze or label it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, and allow it to be what it is, without getting caught up in your mind's story.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying. The air feels cooler going in, my chest rises, my feet press into the floor — but even as I notice that, my mind's already narrating that this calm is the setup for me to say something stupid, the team loses trust, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move ruins everything. I can hold the focus for a few seconds before it pulls me back — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the focus on the physical sensation despite the persistent narrative. One specific area to explore is the value of patience and acceptance. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a pause before we try to do anything else. I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of the breath, and when you notice your mind starts to get caught up in the story, gently say to yourself, "I see my mind having a story again." No judgment, no analysis, just a simple acknowledgment of the thought. Then, pause for a moment before trying to do anything else.

Patient: "I see my mind having a story again." I paused, felt the breath and my feet, and for a few seconds it eased — but then the fortune-telling machine kicked in: I'll fumble, the team will lose confidence, HR will get involved, I'll be fired, I won't find another job here, and the move will ruin everything. I'm getting totally hooked on that chain and it's really overwhelming; can we slow down? I don't know how to make myself believe those outcomes aren't inevitable.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is getting caught up in the cycle of catastrophic thinking again. One specific area to explore is the idea that the outcomes are not fixed or inevitable. Goal: Challenge the notion that the thought is a prediction.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine a time when you made a decision or took a step, and it didn't lead to the worst-case scenario that your mind is predicting now? What happened in that moment?

Patient: Yeah — there was one time I pushed to run a cross-team pilot and it actually went fine: we hit the targets, my boss said it was well-run, and for a few weeks I felt like maybe I hadn't totally screwed everything up. Still, my mind calls that a fluke and immediately says next time I'll stumble, people will notice, HR will get involved, I'll be out, and the move will be ruined. I can remember the calm after that win, but I can't hold onto the idea that it could happen again without the whole disaster chain starting, so I'm feeling really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of a past success, but their mind is still caught in a cycle of catastrophic thinking. One specific theme is the tendency to define success as avoiding failure, rather than embracing the possibility of uncertainty. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore what it would mean to take the step to run the pilot again, not as a way to prove to yourself that you can avoid failure, but simply because it feels important to you. What would you hope to gain or experience if you were to take that step, without worrying about the outcome?

Patient: If I ran the pilot again, I guess I'd hope to feel like I wasn't just surviving the job — maybe get a sense that I can choose things that matter to me and actually make them happen. But the second I let that thought in, my brain's already narrating the whole collapse: I mess up a presentation, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move I made ruins everything. It feels inevitable to me and I get totally hooked on that chain, so I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is getting caught up in the narrative of inevitability, even though they've experienced a past success. One specific area to explore is the value of acting in the present moment, without reliance on a specific outcome. Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to notice what it would mean to you to feel like you're not just surviving, but truly making progress towards what matters to you. What is it that you value most about this sense of agency and control? Can you imagine taking a small step towards that, not because you're trying to avoid failure, but because it feels right to you in this moment?

Patient: What I value most is feeling like I can choose parts of my life that matter to me — not just react to crises at work, but actually make small, meaningful moves and feel some pride in them. I can imagine one tiny step, like booking a 20-minute chat with a colleague to brainstorm a low-stakes idea, but my brain immediately tells the whole story: I stumble in the chat, they lose confidence, it spreads to the team, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move I made collapses everything. I'm honestly feeling really overwhelmed by that chain—can we slow down? I don't know how to even try a small step without the fortune-telling machine taking over.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is valuing autonomy and making meaningful choices, but is getting caught up in catastrophic thinking again. One specific area to explore is the idea that the "fortune-telling machine" is just that - a machine - and can be interrupted. Goal: Introduce a process to interrupt the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. I'd like you to take a deep breath, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I will not engage with this story." Not "I will try to avoid it," not "I will suppress it," but simply, "I will not engage with this story." Just say the words, and allow them to be true. Then, take a moment to notice how you feel, without trying to analyze or change anything.

Patient: "I will not engage with this story." I say it, but my mind immediately screams that it's a lie and starts narrating the whole collapse: I fumble something, the team loses confidence, mistakes spread, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything. My chest tightens, I feel hooked to that narrative and pretty overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know how to make those words stick when my brain is already certain the worst is coming.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to interrupt the catastrophic thinking, and is feeling stuck. One specific area to explore is the concept of mindfulness in the present moment, rather than trying to control the narrative. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back and bring your attention to the sensation of your breath. Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it. As you focus on the breath, I want you to say to yourself, "I am not the thoughts." Just those two words, "I am not the thoughts." Allow them to be true, and see if that brings a sense of clarity or calm.

Patient: "I am not the thoughts." I said it while breathing, and for a second my chest loosened and the breath felt a bit clearer, but then my mind yelled that it's a lie and instantly narrated the whole collapse — I stumble, the team loses confidence, mistakes cascade, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything. I'm getting totally hooked on that story and it's really overwhelming — can we slow down? I don't know how to make that phrase stick.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the defusion of the thought, and is getting caught up in the narrative again. One specific area to explore is the concept of willingness to practice a new skill, rather than trying to control the outcome. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step towards practicing that phrase, "I am not the thoughts." Can you commit to practicing it just for a few more moments, without worrying about the outcome? Say it to yourself, "I am not the thoughts," and allow it to become a simple, repeated phrase. We can start with just one more breath, and see how that feels.

Patient: Okay, I'll try saying it once more and take a breath. But I'm already bracing—my brain will turn that calm into the prelude to disaster: I mess up, the team notices, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move ruins everything. I'm really overwhelmed and hooked on that chain—can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to let go of the narrative, even with the repetition of the phrase. One specific area to explore is the concept of self-compassion and acknowledging the effort. Goal: Validate the patient's willingness to practice.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to try to practice saying "I am not the thoughts" again, and I appreciate your willingness to take that step. It's okay if your mind starts to spiral again - that's not a failure, it's just the mind doing its thing. Can you allow yourself to take a moment to notice how you're feeling, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm noticing my chest is tight and my head's buzzing — the thoughts are loud and certain: if I let this sit, I'll try something, mess up in front of my team, HR will get involved, I'll get fired, and the move will collapse everything. I can repeat "I am not the thoughts" but it barely lands; I'm really overwhelmed and hooked on that story, so can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete to help me stay here?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the focus on the present moment, and is getting caught up in the narrative again. One specific area to explore is the concept of small, incremental steps towards self-care. Goal: Introduce a concrete, low-stakes action to help the patient stay present.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step towards taking care of yourself. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without trying to analyze it or change it? Just focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, and allow yourself to be there for a moment, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — my feet feel solid on the floor, a little pressure under the heels and a faint tingle at the toes, and that actually eases me for a few seconds. But as soon as I relax, my mind's already spinning the same movie: I try something, fumble, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move ruins everything. I'm really stuck on that chain and feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete to keep me here?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the focus on the present moment, and is getting caught up in the narrative again. One specific area to explore is the concept of mindfulness in a more tangible way. Goal: Create a concrete, experiential exercise to help the patient stay present.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like to try a simple exercise with you. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils? Just notice the sensation of the breath, without trying to analyze it or change it. Allow yourself to be present with that sensation, and see if that brings you back to the present moment.

Patient: I can feel the air in my nostrils — cool going in, warmer going out — and for a few seconds it steadies me. But almost immediately my fortune-telling machine kicks in: I stumble, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything. I'm getting totally hooked on that chain and starting to spiral; can we slow down and try something even more concrete to keep me here? I don't know how to stop it from spinning.

The patient is struggling to maintain the focus on the present moment, and is getting caught up in the narrative again. One specific area to explore is the concept of defusion through experiential exercise. Goal: Create a concrete, experiential exercise to help the patient break the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something more concrete. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your body as you sit here, without trying to change it or analyze it. Instead, I'd like you to imagine that your body is a blob of jelly, soft and squishy. Can you imagine that your body is a blob of jelly, and that it's completely relaxed and at ease?

Patient: Okay — I can try picturing myself as a blob of jelly; my shoulders loosen and my jaw unclenches for a second. But the instant I feel that calm, my brain yells that it's a setup: I look too relaxed, I fumble, the team loses confidence, mistakes spread, HR gets involved, I'm out, and the move ruins everything. I'm getting totally hooked on that chain and it's really overwhelming — can we slow down and do something more concrete to keep me here?

The patient is struggling to maintain the focus on the present moment, and is getting caught up in the narrative again. One specific area to explore is the concept of mindfulness in a highly experiential way. Goal: Create a concrete, experiential exercise to help the patient break the cycle of catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something more concrete. I'd like you to bring your attention to your sense of bodily sensations, one specific spot at a time. Let's start with your right foot. Notice the sensation of your right foot on the ground, without trying to analyze it or change it. Just notice the sensation, and allow it to be what it is. Then, when you're ready, we can move to your left foot.

Patient: Right foot: I feel the heel pressing into the floor, a steady weight, a slight warmth around the arch. Left foot: lighter, a bit more tingle at the toes and less pressure under the ball. But as soon as I notice that, my mind's already spinning the usual movie — I loosen up, I fumble something, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything — I'm getting really hooked on that chain and feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down?

One specific area to explore is the concept of mindfulness in a highly experiential way, using a different anchor.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. I'd like you to bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils again, but this time, I'd like you to notice the sensation of your heart beating. Can you feel the sensation of your heart beating, without trying to analyze it or change it? Just notice the sensation of the heartbeat, and allow it to be what it is.

Patient: I can feel my heart — it's fast and a little fluttery, like it's trying to sprint away. The moment I notice it my mind turns that into proof I'm panicking and narrates the whole collapse: I fumble, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything. I'm getting totally hooked on that chain and it's really overwhelming — can we slow down and do something even smaller or more concrete to keep me here?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something even smaller. Can you simply say to yourself, "I am here. I am sitting. I am present. I am willing to be present, even if my mind is having a story." Just say those words, and allow them to be true. Don't try to analyze or change them, just allow them to be.

Patient: "I am here. I am sitting. I am present. I am willing to be present, even if my mind is having a story." For a second it felt like it landed — a little steadiness — but then my mind yells that it's a lie and immediately spins the whole collapse: I fumble, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I'm fired, and the move ruins everything.

I am sitting. I am present. I am willing to be present, even if my mind is having a story." Just say it with me, and then pause for a moment before we try again.

Patient: "I am here. I am sitting. I am present. I am willing to be present, even if my mind is having a story." Saying it gave a tiny steadying feeling for a second, then my brain screamed that it’s a setup and spun the whole collapse — I fumble, the team loses confidence, HR gets involved, I get fired, and the move ruins everything.
