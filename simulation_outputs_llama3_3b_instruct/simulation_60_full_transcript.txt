--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Um, lately I've been stuck worrying all the time about how I'm doing at work—like if my lessons are good enough or if the kids think I'm, I don't know, any good. It's gotten to the point where I procrastinate preparing things because I'm scared they'll be wrong. I guess I'm just kind of overwhelmed and unsure how to stop.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses feeling stuck, with anxiety about work performance and uncertainty about being good enough. Core emotion is insecurity. Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of this avoidance behavior to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
What specific tasks or situations at work do you find yourself putting off because of worries about not being good enough, and what's the smallest, most manageable step you could take towards addressing those concerns?

Patient: I put off detailed lesson planning, grading stacks of papers, and sending parent emails—basically anything where I imagine being judged or messing up. I don't know... I guess the smallest step would be to set a 10‑minute timer and just write the lesson objective and one simple activity for tomorrow, nothing else.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's avoidance behavior is centered around fear of judgment and perfectionism, with a focus on the process (preparing materials) rather than the outcome (grading and communicating with parents). Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine having the exact same message for tomorrow's lesson, even if it's just a rough outline, and how would that feel to take this small action, as if it were a value-driven step towards being more confident and competent in your teaching?

Patient: I guess I can imagine sending the same rough outline for tomorrow. It would probably feel a little relieving — like less pressure than trying to perfect everything — but also kind of wrong, like I'm cheating or it won't be enough. I don't know, maybe it's a start, but I'm nervous it won't actually help.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient struggles with the concept of "good enough" and is caught between the desire to perfect and the fear of appearing imperfect. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Can you take a moment to acknowledge that the thought "cheating" or "not doing enough" doesn't quite capture what's really going on – that it's more about not wanting to be "perfect" and being willing to experiment with a smaller step, even if it doesn't lead to perfection?

Patient: I guess I can see that — it's probably more about this need to be perfect and being terrified of getting called out. I don't know, saying that out loud makes me feel exposed and kind of shaky. Can we... talk about how I'd actually do the 10‑minute plan without spiraling?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming more aware of their need for perfection and the fear of being called out, but is also struggling with self-revelation and vulnerability. Goal: Introduce mindfulness as a process for coping with spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a few deep breaths together and notice how your body feels right now – is there a physical sensation in your chest or belly that might be signaling when you're starting to feel shaky or overwhelmed?

Patient: I can feel it — a tightness in my chest and this knot in my stomach, and my breathing's pretty shallow. My shoulders are tense and my thoughts start racing. I don't know, saying that makes me feel exposed — can we talk about how to actually do the 10‑minute plan without me spiraling?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming more aware of their physical sensations and emotional responses to self-revelation. Goal: Introduce mindfulness as a process for coping with spiraling.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the physical sensations in your body, specifically the tightness in your chest and the knot in your stomach. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or stop it, just observe it as it is?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying — my breath's shallow and quick, my chest feels tighter and the knot in my stomach gets worse when I focus on it. I notice that as soon as I watch my breath my brain flips to all the stuff I should've done and I tense up. I don't know... can we go back to concrete steps for the 10‑minute plan and how to handle the racing thoughts when they show up?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having difficulty with mindfulness and self-regulation, as their thoughts quickly shift to rumination and anxiety. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help regulate thoughts and physical sensations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to pause before responding to your thoughts, and instead, focus on a simple phrase: "I will do the 10-minute plan as a small, imperfect action, even if I'm not sure what the outcome will be. I will take this step, and that's enough."

Patient: I guess I'll try saying that to myself — "I'll do the 10‑minute plan... and that's enough." I don't know, it still makes my chest tight and my mind just shoots off to a million other things. Can we actually map out what I'd do in those 10 minutes and what to say to myself when the racing thoughts start?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is having trouble integrating the new phrase and is getting caught up in racing thoughts again. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of the strategy.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at the 10-minute plan – what specific tasks are you committing to doing in those 10 minutes, and how can you phrase it in a way that acknowledges the uncertainty and imperfection? For example, instead of saying "I'll plan a perfect lesson," say "I'll write down a rough outline for tomorrow's lesson, and that's okay if it's not perfect."

Patient: Okay, I guess here's what I'd actually do in those 10 minutes:

- Set a 10-minute timer and write one sentence for the lesson objective.  
- Jot a single, simple activity (what kids will do) with 2 quick steps so it's usable.  
- List 2–3 materials or resources I'll need and write a one‑line exit ticket or assessment (like one question).

For the self-talk when my brain spins: "I'll write a rough outline for tomorrow — objective, one activity, materials — and that's enough for now, even if it's imperfect." If racing thoughts pop up, I'll quickly write the thought on a 'worry list' and say to myself, "Not now — I will come back to this after the 10 minutes."

I don't know, it still feels awkward saying it out loud, but can we try doing the first one together now?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has identified concrete steps for the 10-minute plan and has developed a self-talk strategy for coping with racing thoughts. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with setting the timer and writing the lesson objective – can you say the sentence out loud together: "I will write down one sentence for tomorrow's lesson objective"?

Patient: Okay... "I'll write down one sentence for tomorrow's lesson objective." I don't know, saying that feels kind of awkward—can we start the timer now so I actually do it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is taking concrete action and is becoming more comfortable with the self-talk strategy. Goal: Create a sense of momentum and confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start the timer now – 10 minutes begins now. As you write the sentence, allow yourself to focus on the physical act of writing, without judgment, and remember the phrase "I'll write a rough outline for tomorrow — objective, one activity, materials — and that's enough for now, even if it's imperfect."

Patient: Okay, I'm writing it: "Students will be able to identify the main idea and two supporting details in a short paragraph." My chest's tight and my hands are a bit shaky, but I got the sentence down. A thought just popped up — "What if they find it boring?" — so I wrote that on the worry list. I don't know, can we move on to the one simple activity now? Can you help me pick a two‑step, low‑prep activity I could actually do without spiraling?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
Patient has successfully written the lesson objective and has identified a worry thought, which was written down on a worry list. Goal: Introduce a low-stakes, low-prep activity to build confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's choose an activity that requires minimal setup and can be completed quickly – how about a simple "Show and Tell" where students share an object from home that illustrates the main idea of the lesson?

Patient: I guess that could work. Maybe keep it really simple: 1) kids bring an object and write one short sentence saying how it shows the main idea, 2) each student shows it and says that sentence (30–60 seconds) and then I ask one quick follow‑up question. 

I don't know… I'm worried it'll get chaotic or parents will think it's pointless. Can we talk about how I keep it short and low‑prep so I don't spiral?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is building confidence in their ability to implement the activity and is becoming aware of their worry about chaos and parental perception. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of the scenario.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at the "Show and Tell" activity – what if, instead of focusing on making it perfect, we focus on doing it for 2-3 minutes, and then we'll take a deep breath, pause, and then move on to the next step?

Patient: Okay... I guess that could work. Maybe keep it tiny: pick 3 volunteers, model one example first, set a 30–45 second timer per student, and use a clear hand signal when time's up. I'll have them write the one sentence before they speak so it's quick. I don't know, I'm still worried they'll ramble or parents will complain — what could I actually say to the class to introduce it so it's short and strict?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is refining the activity to make it more manageable and introducing a clear structure. Goal: Connect the activity to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
What would be an important value to you as a teacher, that aligns with this activity, and how could you introduce it in a way that connects to that value, such as "I want our students to be able to share their unique perspectives and insights with each other, and this activity will help us do just that"?

Patient: I guess an important value for me is helping students feel safe to share and practice being clear and respectful. I could say something like, "Today we're doing a very short show-and-tell to practice finding the main idea — I'll show one example, then three volunteers will share for about 30–45 seconds each, and we'll listen respectfully and ask one quick question." I don't know, that sounds kind of stiff when I say it out loud, but maybe the structure will keep it calm.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has connected the activity to a valuable goal and introduced it in a clear and concise manner. Goal: Create space for future willingness and experimentation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you say it again, slowly and with conviction, without worrying about sounding "stiff" – "Today, we're going to practice finding the main idea in a show-and-tell, and I'll guide us through it. We'll listen to each other's ideas and respect each other's thoughts. Let's give it a try."

Patient: Okay... "Today we're going to practice finding the main idea in a show-and-tell, and I'll guide us through it." "We'll listen to each other's ideas and respect each other's thoughts." "Let's give it a try." I don't know, saying that made my chest tighten and my voice feel kind of shaky — can we practice the quick hand signal I'll use so I don't panic when time's up?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is experiencing a physical response to the introduction, which may indicate some underlying anxiety. Goal: Introduce a small, low-stakes skill to help manage the physical sensation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a simple hand signal – make a gentle, open-fist gesture with your hand, palm facing upwards, and say "Time's up!" in a calm and clear voice. Let's do it together, slowly, and see how it feels.

Patient: Okay… I tried it: "Time's up!" My voice was shaky and my chest got tight — I don't know, it felt weird, but maybe that will help. Can we practice what I say if a kid keeps talking or argues when I stop them?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming more aware of their physical responses and is looking for ways to manage them. Goal: Introduce a simple skill to handle challenging behaviors.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a phrase that acknowledges the child's behavior while still setting a clear boundary – "I hear you, but we need to respect each other's turns. Let's take a deep breath and try again." Try it in a calm, gentle tone, and notice how it feels.

Patient: "Okay... 'I hear you, but we need to respect each other's turns. Let's take a deep breath and try again.'" My voice was shaky and my chest tightened — I felt like I might sound mean. I don't know, what do I actually say if a kid gets upset or keeps arguing?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is concerned about sounding mean or unkind, which may be a manifestation of their own anxiety and self-doubt. Goal: Introduce a skill to handle upset children in a kind and assertive way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a phrase that acknowledges the child's feelings while maintaining a calm and firm tone – "You're feeling really upset right now, and that's okay. It's okay to feel angry or frustrated, but we need to find a way to resolve this respectfully." Try it in a gentle, empathetic tone, and notice how it feels.

Patient: "You're feeling really upset right now, and that's okay. It's okay to feel angry or frustrated, but we need to find a way to resolve this respectfully."

I said it quietly and my voice shook a bit — my chest got tight and I felt kind of guilty like I was being mean even though I wasn't. I don't know… what if they start crying or get louder — what would I actually do next?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is becoming more aware of the nuances of their emotional responses and is looking for ways to manage them. Goal: Introduce a skill to handle escalated situations.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a calm and assertive response to a child who's becoming upset or loud – "I can see that you're really upset. I'm here to help you. Let's take a deep breath together and find a way to calm down. We can step outside for a moment if you need to calm down, and we'll come back to our activity when you're ready." Try it in a gentle, empathetic tone, and notice how it feels.

Patient: "Okay... 'I can see that you're really upset. I'm here to help you. Let's take a deep breath together and find a way to calm down. We can step outside for a moment if you need to calm down, and we'll come back to our activity when you're ready.'"

Saying it made my voice small and my chest tighten — I felt kind of guilty, like maybe I sounded mean even though I wasn't. I don't know... what if the kid refuses to go outside or starts yelling? Can we try a short, firm follow-up I can actually say without panicking? I guess I need something really simple.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling with assertiveness and feeling the need to avoid conflict, even if it means compromising their own needs. Goal: Introduce a simple, firm follow-up that prioritizes the child's safety and the class's well-being.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice a simple, firm follow-up phrase: "I need you to be safe, and I need the class to be respectful. If we can't calm down inside, we'll go outside."

Patient: I guess... "I need you to be safe, and I need the class to be respectful. If we can't calm down inside, we'll go outside." I said it, but my voice felt small and my chest tightened. I don't know — can we try making it even shorter? Maybe something like, "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off."


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is refining their ability to express boundaries and prioritize the class's well-being. Goal: Create a simple, assertive phrase that conveys a clear expectation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's practice the revised phrase: "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off." Notice how it feels to say it, and let's try it in a firm, calm tone, without apologizing or justifying.

Patient: "Okay... 'We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off.'" Saying it made my voice really small and my chest tightened — I kept wanting to soften it or apologize. I don't know, can we practice it again with a simple cue so I can try to stay firmer?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to maintain a firm tone and is tempted to soften or apologize, which may indicate a deep-seated need for approval. Goal: Introduce a simple cue to help maintain a firmer tone.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try practicing a simple hand gesture to remind you to stay firm: hold up your index finger on your dominant hand, and whenever you feel yourself softening, notice the finger and take a deep breath, then repeat the phrase again. Try it, and see how it feels.

Patient: I held up my finger like you said. I guess it helped a little — I actually paused and breathed, but my voice still felt small and my chest tightened. I don't know... can we do one quick run‑through of the whole intro and signal together so I can try it all at once?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is making progress in maintaining a firmer tone and using a simple cue to help them stay on track. Goal: Practice a complete scenario to build confidence and fluency.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a quick run-through of the whole intro and signal together. I'll start: "Okay, students, today we're going to practice finding the main idea in a show-and-tell...". Can you take over and introduce the activity, using the phrase "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off" when needed?

Patient: Okay... "Today we're going to practice finding the main idea in a show-and-tell, and I'll guide us through it." I'll model one quick example, then three volunteers will share for about 30–45 seconds each — please write one short sentence first so it's quick. I'll use the hand signal when time's up, and if we can't stay calm we'll step outside to cool off: "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off." I don't know, that felt kind of shaky, but... can we try it now?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has a solid plan in place and is ready to practice it in a real-world scenario. Goal: Offer a final opportunity to practice and reinforce new skills.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do a quick practice run-through together, and I'll respond as a simulated student. Remember to use the hand signal and the phrase "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off" as needed. Go ahead and start the show-and-tell activity.

Patient: Okay... "Today we're going to practice finding the main idea in a show-and-tell, and I'll guide us through it." I'll model one quick example: this small plant shows the main idea that plants need sunlight to grow — it makes food and leans toward light. Then three volunteers will share: write one short sentence first, show your object, say the sentence (about 30–45 seconds), and I'll ask one quick question. I'll use the hand signal when time's up. I don't know... who wants to go first?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling more confident and prepared to implement the new plan. Goal: Reinforce the new skills in a low-stakes setting.

Therapist Answer:
Let's have Sarah go first. She looks like she's eager to participate. As Sarah writes her sentence, use the hand signal and phrase "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off" if needed.

Patient: Okay, Sarah — when you're ready, show us your object and read your one‑sentence explanation. Try to keep it to about 30 seconds and we'll listen quietly. I guess... go ahead.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
[Thinking and Answer keywords missing]

Therapist Answer:
Sarah:
*holds up a small toy car* "My favorite toy car shows the main idea that cars can be used for fun and transportation." *speaks clearly and at a moderate pace, within the 30-second limit*

You:
*notices the time is up, uses the hand signal, and says* "We need calm now. Let's step outside to cool off."

Patient: Okay... thanks, Sarah. Quick follow-up — can you say in one sentence how your car shows transportation? I don't know, my voice feels kind of shaky, but go ahead.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is starting to feel more confident in their ability to follow up and provide more detail.

Therapist Answer:
Sarah:
"Like, I can drive it in my backyard and my family takes it to grandma's house on the weekends."

Patient: Okay, thanks, Sarah — that actually makes sense. I feel kind of guilty, like maybe I cut her off and parents might complain. I don't know, did that follow-up sound okay? I guess I'm just worried it'll seem too strict or like I'm overreacting.
