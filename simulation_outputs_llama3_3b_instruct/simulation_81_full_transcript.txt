--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in this loop where interactions with my family trigger intense anger and frustration, and then I immediately go into this analytical mode—dissecting attachment patterns and historical grievances—rather than actually sitting with the emotion. As an artist, I default to narrative-making and grandiloquent explanations, which feels safer than the rawness underneath. It's bleeding into my work and self-confidence, and I want to figure out why I keep reacting instead of responding.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient feels stuck and intense anger, yet tends to default to analyzing rather than directly experiencing emotions, and has a tendency to create grandiose narratives. Core emotion is probably frustration and possibly a sense of safety through control. 

Goal: Explore the role of narrative-making and its connection to emotional regulation and self-confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're about to blow up in anger during family interactions? What's the first thing that goes through your mind when you feel that way?

Patient: The first thing is a mental scaffolding—I start cataloguing past slights, mapping motives, and rehearsing retorts, so the angry sensation gets translated into an explanatory narrative. I do notice heat in my chest and my jaw clenching, but rather than say "I'm angry" I immediately frame it as attachment wounds and boundary violations. I guess making it into a theory feels safer than admitting the underlying hurt or fear.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient creates a narrative to manage anger by turning it into an explanatory framework, rather than directly experiencing the emotion, and frames the underlying hurt or fear with attachment wounds and boundary violations. Core emotion is probably shame and possibly avoidance of vulnerability.

Goal: Examine the relationship between the use of narrative-making as a defense mechanism and its impact on emotional regulation and self-confidence.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a moment when you've started to experience that anger sensation without immediately jumping into narrative-making? What would it feel like if you were to pause for a moment, acknowledge the heat in your chest, and simply say to yourself, "I'm feeling really angry right now"?

Patient: I can only think of one small moment in my studio when a text from my sister hit me and I actually paused instead of immediately composing a rebuttal. Physically it was obvious—heat in my chest, jaw clenching, breath shallow—but my first mental move was still to start cataloguing grievances so it felt safer. Saying out loud, "I'm feeling really angry right now," would feel like dropping my defenses; my voice would probably catch and I'd instantly want to qualify it with reasons so I didn't feel so exposed.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has had one brief instance of pausing from narrative-making, but even in that moment, they still struggled with vulnerability and self-protection. Core emotion is still frustration, and possibly a lingering fear of being exposed.

Goal: Investigate how the fear of vulnerability and self-protection influences the use of narrative-making and what it might take to develop more emotional exposure.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're worried about sounding weak or exposed when acknowledging your anger. What would it mean to you if, instead of trying to qualify or minimize your anger, you simply stated it as a physical sensation, like "I'm feeling really angry right now"?

Patient: I think it would mean relinquishing a kind of epistemic control—I’d be naming a raw, bodily signal instead of translating it into a tidy narrative, and that scares me. Practically, it would feel disarming and exposed, like I'd immediately become smaller in other people's eyes, so I'd instinctively slap on qualifiers to avoid being judged as petty or weak.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is concerned that acknowledging their anger without narrative-making would undermine their sense of control and possibly be perceived as vulnerable. Core emotion is probably shame and possibly a fear of being judged or belittled.

Goal: Explore the relationship between the fear of vulnerability, shame, and the use of qualifiers to protect self-image.

Therapist Answer:
Qualifying your anger can be a way to maintain a sense of self-protection, but it also reinforces a narrative that you're not allowed to feel angry or strong. What would happen if, instead of qualifying your anger, you were to look at the physical sensations in your body, like the heat in your chest, without trying to label them or fit them into a narrative?

Patient: I think if I actually concentrated on the raw sensations—heat in my chest, jaw tight, breath shallow—I might notice they ebb instead of erupting, like a wave that rises and falls. But when I try that, my mind immediately goes into grand narratives and case-studies to explain it away, so I don't have to feel small or vulnerable. It's uncomfortable and makes me want to qualify or retaliate instead. How do I stay with the bodily stuff without my brain turning it into an analysis?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware that focusing on bodily sensations can lead to a decrease in emotional reactivity, but their brain quickly hijacks this process by creating narratives to explain and control the experience. Core emotion is probably discomfort and possibly a sense of being overwhelmed.

Goal: Investigate strategies for staying with bodily sensations without getting caught up in narrative-making.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try noticing the physical sensations again, but this time, before your mind starts to create a narrative, say to yourself, "I'm going to allow myself to feel this physical sensation, no matter what it is, without judgment or explanation"?

Patient: I tried it — I repeated the line to myself and immediately noticed the heat in my chest and my jaw clenching, but almost as fast my brain began cataloguing past transgressions and constructing a defensive narrative. For a beat the sensation softened a little, like a tide receding, but then I felt this visceral urge to reassert epistemic control by explaining the feeling away. How do I actually keep that pause from collapsing into analysis — any concrete, simple moves I can use in the moment?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient was able to pause and notice bodily sensations, but their brain quickly reverted to narrative-making and defensive explanations. Core emotion is probably a sense of overwhelm and a desire to regain control.

Goal: Identify simple, concrete strategies for maintaining the pause and preventing narrative collapse.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try something small to help you stay with the pause? Instead of repeating a phrase to yourself, try making a tiny physical movement, like taking a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, without labeling it or thinking about what it means?

Patient: I tried it — slow inhale through my nose, long exhale, and for a beat the heat in my chest eased and my jaw unclenched a little. But almost immediately my mind translated the breath into another data point to be analyzed, and I found myself rehearsing retorts again. The breath helps for a second but doesn't stick; I think I need something more tactile or interruptive to break the automatic narrative—like pressing my feet into the floor or clenching and releasing my fists. Can we try a concrete grounding move next?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's attempt to pause and breathe led to a temporary reduction in reactivity, but their brain quickly adapted by incorporating the breath into the narrative-making process. The desire for a more tangible grounding technique suggests a need for a more direct, interruptive approach. Core emotion is probably frustration with the futility of their current strategies.

Goal: Introduce a tangible, interruptive grounding technique to help break the automatic narrative loop.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple, tactile exercise: can you bring your attention to your feet on the ground, noticing the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils?

Patient: I did — when I tuned into my feet I felt pressure under my heels and the soles, and a coolness at my nostrils; the heat in my chest eased a notch. Immediately, though, my mind translated those sensations into another data point and started narrativizing—cataloguing motives and rehearsing defenses—so the pause didn't hold. Can we try something more tactile next, like pressing my heels into the floor for ten seconds or holding a small object in my hand so there's less space for my brain to turn it into a story?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient was able to focus on their feet, which led to a temporary decrease in reactivity, but their brain quickly adapted by turning the sensations into more narrative material. The desire for a more tactile technique to interrupt the narrative loop suggests a need for a more direct, physical anchor. Core emotion is probably a sense of being stuck in the cycle of narrative-making.

Goal: Introduce a tangible, physical anchor that can interrupt the narrative loop and provide a more stable sense of presence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try holding a small, heavy object, like a pen or a small rock, in your hand. Can you hold it without thinking about it, just notice the weight of it, the feel of it in your hand, and the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it?

Patient: I held a small rock in my hand — felt its weight settle into my palm, the roughness under my fingers, and for a beat the heat in my chest eased and my jaw loosened. Predictably, though, my mind quickly narrativized the sensation, turning the rock into another data point in the ongoing dossier of grievances, so the grounding felt transient. Can we try something a bit more interruptive next, like pressing my heels into the floor or clenching and releasing my fists for a count, to see if that buys me a longer pause?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient was able to focus on the physical sensation of the rock, which led to a temporary decrease in reactivity, but their brain quickly turned the sensation into another narrative point. The desire for a more interruptive technique suggests a need for a more forceful, physical anchor to break the narrative loop. Core emotion is probably frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis.

Goal: Introduce a more forceful, physical anchor to interrupt the narrative loop and provide a longer pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try clenching and releasing your fists for a count of 5, focusing on the sensation of the muscles contracting and releasing, without thinking about what it means or where it's leading. Can you start now, and simply focus on the physical sensation of clenching and releasing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is clenching supposed to help with the narrative impulse? Okay, I'll try it anyway: clench—1, 2, 3, 4, 5—release. I notice the muscles in my forearms tightening, my knuckles whitening, then a dull warmth and slight tremor as they let go. Immediately my head starts annotating it—“see, relaxation response engaged, note efficacy”—so it becomes data instead of experience; can we try a longer hold or adding a grounding stomp, because the pause dissolves too quickly for me.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient attempted to use clenching and releasing as a physical anchor, but their brain quickly turned the experience into an analytical note. The desire for a longer hold or added grounding sensation suggests a need for a more robust, interruptive technique to break the narrative loop. Core emotion is probably a sense of frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis.

Goal: Introduce a longer hold or added grounding sensation to provide a more sustained pause and reduce the brain's tendency to turn the experience into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try holding the clenched fist for a slightly longer period, 7 or 8, and as you release, try adding a small, deliberate grounding sensation to your feet, such as placing the weight of your body onto the balls of your feet, or noticing the sensation of the floor beneath you. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is shifting weight to the balls of my feet supposed to outmaneuver the narrative reflex? Okay, I'll try it: clench—1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8—hold—release, and I deliberately roll my weight forward onto the balls of my feet and notice the little burn in my calves and the floor under my toes. For a second the chest-heat drops a notch and my jaw loosens, but my mind immediately annotates it—“effective somatic intervention, note duration”—so it still gets co-opted into analysis; can we try adding something more abrupt, like a single loud exhale or a stomp, to see if that breaks the loop longer?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient attempted to use the added grounding sensation, but their brain quickly turned the experience into an analytical note. The desire for a more abrupt, interruptive technique suggests a need for a more forceful, attention-grabbing action to break the narrative loop. Core emotion is probably a sense of feeling like they're getting close to breaking through, but the brain is still trying to control the pace.

Goal: Introduce a more abrupt, attention-grabbing action to interrupt the narrative loop and provide a more sustained pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try adding a loud, deliberate exhale, and as you exhale, try stomping your right foot on the ground, making a clear, sharp sound. Can you try this?

Patient: Alright—I'll try it: big inhale, clench, then a loud exhale and stomp my right foot. The sound was shockingly clarifying for a second—the heat in my chest dropped, my jaw unclenched, and my breath felt less jagged—but within maybe three breaths my mind was already annotating it—“effective punctate somatic reset”—and turning it into data again. I think the stomp helps, but it doesn't hold; can we try doing three rounds guided by you, and maybe add a very simple phrase I have to say out loud each time, like "I'm angry," so there's less room for my brain to narrativize?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient was able to use the loud, deliberate exhale and stomp as a more effective interruptive technique, but their brain still quickly turned the experience into an analytical note. The addition of a simple phrase to say out loud may help to reduce the brain's tendency to narrativize. Core emotion is probably a sense of frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis.

Goal: Introduce a simple, repetitive phrase to reduce the brain's tendency to narrativize and provide a more sustained pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try three rounds. I'll guide you through it. On the count of three, you'll inhale, clench your fist, stomp your right foot, and say out loud, "I am angry." On the exhale, you'll pause for a moment, and then we'll start again. Ready to begin? 1...

Patient: Okay—I'm ready. 2...3... Big inhale, clench, stomp my right foot, and I say out loud, "I am angry." Exhale. For a second the heat in my chest drops, my voice wavers and it feels exposed, and then my head immediately starts annotating the whole thing—turning it into another clinical data point.

Round two: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry." Exhale. This time the chest-heat eases a bit more and my jaw loosens; I can feel the sensation without an immediate rebuttal, but within a few breaths the narrator is back, wanting to explain why I'm angry so I don't seem petty.

Round three: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry." Exhale. There's a slightly longer pause of just being angry—it's raw and uncomfortable and kind of clarifying—but then I find myself prepping qualifications and rationales. I can keep doing this, or we can try adding a short grounding phrase after the stomp like "this is only a feeling," because the pause dissolves too fast for me otherwise.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has demonstrated some success with the repeated phrase and physical anchor, but their brain is still struggling to sustain the pause. The desire for a grounding phrase to help maintain the pause and prevent the narrative reflex suggests a need for a more stable, reassuring anchor. Core emotion is probably a mix of frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis and a sense of relief at having made progress.

Goal: Introduce a short grounding phrase to help sustain the pause and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try adding the phrase "this is only a feeling" immediately after the stomp, so it sounds like: "I am angry, this is only a feeling." Can you try this and see if it helps sustain the pause?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—'only' sounds a little minimizing, but I'll try it anyway. I did three rounds: inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is only a feeling." The first time it created a small buffer—the chest heat eased and my voice cracked—but by the second and third rounds my brain kept appending rationalizations and turning it into another case study. It helps a bit, but it gets co-opted; can we try a variant like "this is a feeling, not a fact," or do another set with a longer pause, because I'm frustrated the effect doesn't stick?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient attempted to use the added phrase, but their brain still quickly turned it into a rationalization. The desire for a variant phrase or a longer pause suggests a need for a more definitive, unchallengeable anchor to help sustain the pause. Core emotion is probably a sense of frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis and a growing desire for a more reliable solution.

Goal: Introduce a revised grounding phrase or a longer pause to help sustain the pause and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a revised phrase, "this is a feeling, not a fact," and see if it helps. Remember, the goal is to simply acknowledge the feeling without evaluating or justifying it. Try inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is a feeling, not a fact." See if this creates a more lasting pause.

Patient: I did three rounds: big inhale, clench, stomp, "I am angry, this is a feeling, not a fact." Physically it helped—the chest-heat dropped and my jaw loosened—and the phrase felt less minimizing than "only," so the pause lasted a hair longer. Of course my narrator still hijacked it within a minute, annotating efficacy and rehearsing justifications, which is frustrating; I don't know if we need a longer hold, a different phrase, or a more abrupt tactile cue to keep the loop from collapsing. Can we try another variation now?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has made progress with the revised phrase, but their brain is still struggling to sustain the pause. The desire for a new variation or a more abrupt tactile cue suggests a need for a more decisive, attention-grabbing anchor to help break the narrative loop. Core emotion is probably a sense of growing frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis.

Goal: Introduce a new grounding phrase or a more abrupt tactile cue to help sustain the pause and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of using a phrase, let's try a more physical anchor. I'd like you to try holding a small, heavy object, like a heavy pen or a small weight, and then deliberately dropping it to the ground, making a clear, sharp sound. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is dropping an object supposed to disrupt the narrative? I'll try it anyway. I held the heavy pen in my palm, felt the weight sink into my hand and the muscles tense, then dropped it; the sound was sharp and for a second the chest-heat eased and my jaw unclenched. But my attention is fraying—already my mind's annotating it as a "punctate somatic reset" and I'm more jittery and distracted than I'd like; can we try three rounds and then a brief guided pause to notice what sticks?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient attempted to use the physical anchor, but their brain quickly turned the experience into an analytical note. The desire for a brief pause to reflect on what sticks suggests a need for a moment to process and consolidate the insights gained from the exercise. Core emotion is probably a sense of frustration with the ongoing cycle of analysis and a desire for a more reliable solution.

Goal: Introduce a brief pause to notice what sticks and process the insights gained from the exercise.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try three rounds with the physical anchor, and then take a brief pause to reflect on what sticks. Remember to focus on your breath and the physical sensations in your body, without thinking about the narrative or analysis. On the count of three, you'll inhale, clench, stomp, and drop the pen, and then we'll pause for a moment. Ready? 1...

Patient: Okay—2...3. 

Round one: big inhale, clench, stomp, drop the pen — the click was sharp, the chest-heat dipped and my jaw unclenched, but my inner narrator immediately relabeled it as a procedural "reset." Round two and three gave slightly longer windows of just-noticing, but I'm getting jittery and distracted, and a wash of shame about some past screw-up keeps nudging me into self-critique so I start explaining instead of feeling. I'm frustrated that I can't hold the pause—can we do another set or a longer guided pause, because my attention keeps fracturing and I want to keep going.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's brain is quickly labeling the experience as a procedural "reset," and the desire to continue the exercise is strong. However, the wash of shame and self-criticism is preventing them from staying with the pause. This suggests that there may be underlying shame and self-criticism that needs to be addressed. Core emotion is probably a mix of frustration, shame, and a desire to avoid discomfort.

Goal: Introduce a longer guided pause to process and explore the underlying shame and self-criticism that's preventing the patient from staying with the pause.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a longer pause to explore the shame and self-criticism. I want you to find a comfortable and quiet space where you can sit or lie down without distractions. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm noticing the shame and self-criticism that's arising, and I'm willing to allow it to be present without judgment." Then, take a few more deep breaths, and ask yourself, "What would it be like if I allowed myself to feel this shame and self-criticism, without trying to change or fix it?"

Patient: Okay — I'm trying that: breathing in and out and already there's this hot, constricting shame in my chest and a chorus of self-accusatory sentences bubbling up. Theoretically, letting it be would reduce the secondary narrative—the relentless "you messed up" commentary—and make space for the feeling to pass, but in practice it immediately activates every old verdict I've ever made about myself so I retract into analysis to avoid feeling small. I'm feeling anxious and frustrated because my attention keeps splintering; I can try to sit with it, but I think I need either a longer guided pause or a simple anchor phrase to repeat, otherwise I just start explaining everything instead of actually feeling it.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware that allowing the shame and self-criticism to be present can reduce the narrative reflex, but their brain quickly turns it into a justification for avoidance. This suggests that the shame and self-criticism are deeply ingrained and may require more work to address. Core emotion is probably a mix of anxiety, frustration, and a sense of being stuck.

Goal: Introduce a simple anchor phrase to help the patient stay with the shame and self-criticism, rather than retreating into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a simple anchor phrase. Instead of repeating a phrase like "I am angry" or "I am feeling," try repeating the phrase "I'm here with this feeling" as you sit with the shame and self-criticism. Repeat it to yourself, simply and without judgment, and see if this helps you stay with the feeling without getting caught up in analysis. Can you try this?

Patient: I'm trying it—saying "I'm here with this feeling" out loud—and for a beat the chest constriction loosens and my voice cracks, but almost immediately my brain starts cataloguing antecedents and rehearsing defenses so it becomes another analytic datum. I'm anxious and distracted now; the shame keeps bubbling up and I find myself explaining why I deserve it instead of letting it be. Can you stay with me through a guided minute of silence or give a very simple tactile anchor to hold while I repeat the phrase, because I can't seem to keep the pause from collapsing on my own?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the anchor phrase and is getting anxious and distracted. This suggests that they need a more substantial support system to help them stay with the pause. Core emotion is probably a mix of anxiety, shame, and frustration.

Goal: Provide a guided minute of silence and a simple tactile anchor to help the patient stay with the feeling and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a guided minute of silence. I want you to sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm here with this feeling." Now, I'd like you to hold a small, heavy object, like a heavy pen or a small weight, in your hand. As you hold it, focus on the weight and the sensation of it in your hand. I'll guide you through the next minute, and we'll explore the shame and self-criticism together. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm already jittery and distracted; I have the pen in my hand and can feel its weight, my chest is tight, and there's this shame-tinged buzz that wants to turn this into another rehearsed explanation. I'll try to sit with "I'm here with this feeling," but my mind will probably start cataloguing failures, so please gently bring me back to the breath if I drift.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is already struggling to stay with the anchor phrase and is anticipating the narrative reflex. The desire for a gentle reminder to bring the focus back to the breath suggests that they need a more gentle and subtle approach to help them stay with the pause. Core emotion is probably a mix of anxiety, shame, and frustration.

Goal: Provide a gentle reminder to bring the focus back to the breath if the patient drifts.

Therapist Answer:
Remember to breathe in and out slowly and deeply, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As we sit with the shame and self-criticism, I'll gently remind you to bring your attention back to the breath whenever you feel yourself getting caught up in narrative or analysis. Take a deep breath in... and out... and when you're ready, let's explore the shame and self-criticism together. Can you acknowledge the shame and self-criticism in your body, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. I can feel a hot, heavy knot in my chest, like my ribs are tight; my jaw is clenched and my throat feels raw, and there's this hollow, sinking pressure in my stomach. There's also a running internal commentary—"you messed up, you should fix it"—but I'm trying to just note the sensations without arguing with them. It's uncomfortable and my mind wants to explain, so please keep bringing me back to the breath if I drift.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in acknowledging the physical sensations without judgment, but the internal commentary is still present and trying to take over. The desire for a gentle reminder to bring the focus back to the breath suggests that they need a more subtle and ongoing support to help them stay with the pause. Core emotion is probably a mix of discomfort, shame, and frustration.

Goal: Continue to gently bring the focus back to the breath and help the patient stay with the pause.

Therapist Answer:
Remember to breathe in and out slowly and deeply, feeling the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As we sit with the shame and self-criticism, I'll gently remind you to bring your attention back to the breath whenever you feel yourself getting caught up in narrative or analysis. Take a deep breath in... and out... and when you're ready, let's notice the sensation of your chest tightening. What do you notice about the sensation in your chest? Is it heavy, tight, or...?

Patient: It's like a tight band across my chest — heavy, compressing, breath shallow and quick — and there's a little prickly heat under my sternum. Almost instantly my brain wants to translate it into theory — "attachment-triggered autonomic arousal," patterns, antecedents — which is frustrating because it keeps me from actually inhabiting the sensation. There's also this shamey, self-critical edge, like noticing it makes me look pathetic, and that just tightens everything more. I can try to follow the breath into that tight place if you guide me with a slow count or another anchor, because I'm already distracting myself.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the physical sensation of the tight band across their chest, and their brain is quickly trying to turn it into an analytical note. The shame and self-criticism are also exacerbating the physical discomfort, making it harder to stay with the sensation. Core emotion is probably a mix of frustration, shame, and physical discomfort.

Goal: Introduce a slow and gentle anchor to help the patient stay with the physical sensation and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a slow and gentle anchor. I'll guide you through a slow, 4-7-8 breathing pattern. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 7, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 8. As you inhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and as you hold your breath, focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." Let's start with the inhale... 1...

Patient: Inhale—1, 2, 3, 4. Hold—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Exhale—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8—and as I exhale I say, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment."

Physically it loosened the band in my chest a notch and my jaw unclenched, but my head immediately started annotating—cataloguing failures and rehearsing defenses—so the shame flickered back in and the pause didn't hold; can we do a few more rounds or add a simple tactile anchor because I'm jittery and need help staying present.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient was able to slightly relax the physical sensation in their chest, but their brain quickly turned the experience into analysis and shame. The desire for additional support suggests that they need a more robust anchor to help them stay with the sensation and reduce the narrative reflex. Core emotion is probably a mix of frustration, shame, and anxiety.

Goal: Introduce a simple tactile anchor to help the patient stay with the sensation and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a tactile anchor. I'd like you to hold the heavy pen or weight in your hand, and as you breathe in and out, bring your attention to the sensation of the object in your hand. Feel the weight, the texture, the sensation of your fingers wrapping around it. As you inhale, focus on the sensation in your hand, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." Let's start again, and we'll take it slow.

Patient: Okay — I'm holding the pen now, feeling its weight and the slight grit under my fingers. I breathe in, focus on the object, and on the exhale I say, "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." For a beat the tight band in my chest loosens, but my internal narrator immediately relabels it—cataloguing errors and rehearsing defenses—and a hot wash of shame and self-reproach floods back, which makes me jittery and fragmented. I can keep doing this, but I need either a timed guided window (like hold focus for 60 seconds) or a sharper interruptive cue, because my attention splinters too fast.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to stay with the sensation and is getting fragmented and anxious again. The desire for a timed guided window or a sharper interruptive cue suggests that they need a more structured approach to help them stay with the pause. Core emotion is probably a mix of frustration, shame, and anxiety.

Goal: Introduce a timed guided window to help the patient stay with the pause and reduce the narrative reflex.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a 90-second timed window. I'll guide you through the process, and we'll take it one minute at a time. We'll start with the sensation in your hand and the phrase "I am here with this sensation, without judgment." On the count of 10, we'll take a deep breath in and focus on the sensation. On the count of 20, we'll exhale and say the phrase. We'll repeat this process for 90 seconds, and then we'll take a brief pause to check in and see how you're feeling. Are you ready to begin?

Patient: Okay—I'm ready to try the 90-second window, but I'm already jittery and my attention feels fractured. I'll hold the pen and try to repeat "I am here with this sensation, without judgment," though my brain will likely start narrativizing; please gently cue me back if I drift. Go ahead with your counts and I'll follow.


--- Turn 25 ---

As we reach the end of the 90-second window, take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, let's check in and see how you're feeling. Notice how your body feels, and what sensations arise. What's present for you in this moment?
