Patient: I'm a nurse in my mid-fifties and since starting this demanding new program at work I've been feeling overwhelmed, sinking into sadness, and I can't seem to find the motivation to do much. It's starting to affect my relationship — I withdraw, get snappy, and then feel even worse about myself. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried talking about this before, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we're not feeling our best. Can you tell me more about what it is about this new program at work that's causing you the most stress and making you feel overwhelmed? What are some specific tasks or responsibilities that feel particularly challenging?

Patient: It's the relentless workload — new electronic charting, extra paperwork, longer shifts, and being expected to supervise trainees while I'm still learning the program. I keep falling behind; simple things take longer, I second-guess myself, and then I get snappy at home because I'm exhausted. I've tried lists and scheduling breaks and it doesn't really help — so how is talking about all this supposed to make any of it better?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're drowning in the workload, and it's affecting not just your work but also your relationships at home. Can you imagine what it would be like if you could take just 5-10 minutes each day to focus on a small, specific task that brings you a sense of control or satisfaction?

Patient: I guess I can picture it in theory, but it feels unrealistic—I'm usually too wiped out or distracted by the next shift to do even five minutes of anything. I've tried microtasks and tiny goals before and they just end up feeling like another thing I fail at. How is that supposed to change the cycle, and what if I can't even pull it off—won't I just feel worse?

Therapist: Willingness isn't about achieving some sort of magical fix or perfecting a new skill. It's about showing up with an open and curious mind, even when you're tired or uncertain. What if, instead of trying to muster up more motivation or energy, you simply allowed yourself to be with the feeling of being overwhelmed, without judgment? Can you take a deep breath and try that for just one minute, without adding any expectations or pressure?

Patient: Alright... I can try a breath, but one minute feels like forever when my mind's racing. I'm feeling heavy, exhausted, behind on everything, and guilty for snapping at my partner — and honestly, sitting with that usually just makes me spiral. How is that supposed to help, really?

Therapist: Let's try to create some space around the thought that you're "falling behind" and "guilty" about snapping at your partner. Can you notice the phrase "falling behind" and say it out loud with me, as if it's just a sentence: "I'm falling behind." How does that sound?

Patient: "I'm falling behind." Saying it out loud feels flat and makes my chest tighten — it just brings up shame and that voice telling me I'm not cut out for this. How is that supposed to help? I've said that to myself a thousand times and it mostly just makes me feel worse.

Therapist: Let's try something different. What if, instead of focusing on the label "falling behind," you allowed yourself to simply acknowledge that you're feeling overwhelmed and tired right now? No judgment, no self-criticism. Just a simple acknowledgment: "I'm feeling really tired and overwhelmed." Can you try that?

Patient: "I'm feeling really tired and overwhelmed." Saying it aloud kind of loosens the tightness in my chest a little, but then that voice jumps in telling me it's pathetic to feel this way. How is just naming it supposed to help when I've still got a pile of charting, longer shifts, and I keep snapping at my partner—I've tried mindfulness and it didn't stick. Can we try something more concrete that might actually change how I handle the day, instead of me just saying feelings out loud?

Therapist: Let's explore creating a small, concrete action that you can take each day to help manage your workload and reduce stress. Can you identify one task, just one, that you can do each day to take care of yourself, even if it's just taking a 5-minute break or responding to a personal message from your partner? No pressure, just a small step.

Patient: Okay — I guess one small thing I could try is sending my partner one short message during a break (like “thinking of you”), or actually stepping outside for five minutes to breathe between tasks. But I'm skeptical — if that becomes another thing I fail at, won't I just feel worse? How is that supposed to actually change my motivation or the backlog of work?

Therapist: Let's try to shift your perspective on these small actions. Instead of thinking of them as separate, individual tasks that you might fail at, what if you saw them as small experiments to help you navigate this challenging situation? Think of them as tiny steps in a process, not as a guaranteed solution. Can you try sending that message to your partner or taking a short break without judgment, just to see what happens?

Patient: Alright — I'll try sending one short message during my next break, something dumb like "Thinking of you." I'm not optimistic — how is that supposed to change anything, and if I forget or it feels forced I'll just beat myself up more. Can you help me figure out a way to do it that doesn't turn into another thing I fail at?

Therapist: Let's connect this to a value that's important to you. What is it about being a good partner and a capable person that's at stake for you in taking care of your communication with your partner? Can you think of a specific value, like "I value our relationship" or "I want to be a supportive partner"? Let's see if we can tie this small action to that value.

Patient: I do value our relationship — I want to be someone my partner can count on and not the grumpy, checked-out person I’ve been. But now when I think about sending a short message, this hot shame and that old failure just wells up and I feel like I’m setting myself up to fail again. So yeah, how is this supposed to help when every small thing feels like proof I’m not capable, and I’ll just beat myself up if it goes wrong?

Therapist: Let's try a different angle. Instead of trying to "not fail" or "do it perfectly," what if we focus on simply showing up with kindness and care towards yourself, even when it's hard? Can you try sending that short message with the intention of simply being present and thinking of your partner, without judgment or expectation of success?

Patient: I can try, but the moment I think about it that hot shame spikes and I feel like I'm setting myself up to fail again. How is "being present" supposed to be any different from all the other things I've tried that just left me feeling worse? If we're going to do this, I need something concrete — like drafting one ultra-simple message now that I can copy-paste, or a timed reminder tied to an existing break so it doesn't rely on me remembering — can we make it that practical?

Therapist: Let's create a concrete tool to help you stay on track. Can you draft a very simple message, just two words: "I care." That's it. No thoughts, no feelings, just two words. Can you copy and paste it into your phone now, and make it a reminder for your next break?

Patient: Okay… I copied "I care." into my phone and set a reminder for my next break. Saying it makes that hot shame spike — feels like it'll just be another thing I mess up — but I'll try to let it go off and send it without overthinking. How is that actually supposed to help me feel less like a failure?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can you take a moment to notice the physical sensation in your body right now, where the shame is showing up? Where do you feel it in your body? Can you allow that sensation to be exactly as it is, without trying to change it or judge it in any way?

Patient: There's a heavy tightness in my chest, a knot in my stomach, my throat gets tight and my shoulders feel weighed down. I'm trying to let those sensations be without fixing them, but that hot shame keeps bubbling up — how is just noticing this supposed to help?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can you say to the sensations in your body: "This is present. This is here now. It's not you, it's not a problem, it's just this moment?"

Patient: I said it — “This is present… it’s just this moment,” and my chest loosened a little, but that hot shame jumped up and I felt small and sluggish. How is that supposed to help with the pile of charting and the reminder to send the message — can we make this tie to something concrete I can actually do?

Therapist: Let's tie this back to your goal of improving your relationships. Can you recall what it is about being a good partner that's important to you? What specific value or commitment are you making to yourself when you send that simple message? What would it take for you to feel more confident in that commitment?

Patient: I want to be someone my partner can count on — dependable, not the snappy, checked-out person I've been. My commitment in sending that tiny message is to keep showing up in a way that matches that value, but to feel confident I need practical scaffolding: scheduled reminders tied to breaks, a couple of pre-made one-liners I can copy, and some small, real reassurance from my partner when I do it. Honestly, though, how is that supposed to help when the workload and that voice keep hijacking everything — can we make a plan that doesn't rely on me remembering or feeling brave in the moment?

Therapist: Let's create a system that takes some of the pressure off. Can you make a simple, pre-planned plan with your partner: during your next break, after the reminder goes off, you'll send the message, and your partner will respond with a brief, kind message back. This way, you'll have a clear structure and support system to help you feel more confident in your commitment.

Patient: That plan might actually help... in theory — but the hot shame spikes just thinking about it and I can already feel myself bracing to fail. Can you help me draft 2–3 ultra-simple partner responses (like "Got you" or "Love you") and a fallback plan if they can't reply or I forget — maybe an automatic text or a checklist tied to my shift schedule — and tell me how to set reminders that line up with irregular breaks?

Therapist: Let's draft some simple partner responses to help you feel more connected and appreciated. Here are a few options:

* "Thinking of you"
* "Just saw you in my mind"
* "Love you too"

These are just a starting point. You can also add some emojis or personal touches to make them feel more authentic.

As for the fallback plan, we can use a simple automatic text to remind you to send the message or check in with your partner during your shift. You can set up a recurring reminder on your phone to go off at your regular breaks, and also create a checklist on your phone or a sticky note to mark off each time you send a message.

To make it more forgiving, we can also create a "grace period" for forgetting or not getting a response. For example, if you forget to send a message or don't get a response, you can give yourself permission to send a follow-up message later in the day, or the next day.

Patient: Okay… those example replies might work. Make them ultra-simple so I can copy-paste:

- Partner replies to use: "Got you.", "Love you.", "Thinking of you."
- Fallback lines if they can't reply or I forget: "Sorry, missed my break—thinking of you now." and "Won't be able to text much today, love you."

I don't know how to set automatic texts or reliable reminders for irregular breaks — can you give me very simple, step-by-step instructions for:
1) scheduling/auto-sending a message on iPhone (Shortcuts or an app), 
2) doing the same on Android (built-in schedule or an app), and 
3) a quick way to make a checklist tied to my shift schedule (phone note or calendar) so I can mark it off. 

Keep the steps short and concrete — I'm too wiped to figure this out on my own, and just thinking about it makes that shame spike again, so please make it foolproof.

Therapist: Let's get you set up with a foolproof system. I'll guide you through each step, and you can follow along.

**Step 1: iPhone (Shortcuts)**

1. Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.
2. Tap "+" to create a new shortcut.
3. Search for "get reminders" and choose the "Get Reminders" option.
4. Set up a new reminder to go off at each break (you can use a specific time or a recurring reminder).
5. Add a message that says "Send message to partner" and link it to the message you want to send (e.g. "Thinking of you").
6. Save the shortcut and test it to make sure it works.

**Step 2: Android (built-in schedule)**

1. Open your phone's calendar app.
2. Long-press on the day of your shift and select "Create event".
3. Set up a reminder for each break (you can use a specific time or a recurring reminder).
4. Add a note to the event that says "Send message to partner" and link it to the message you want to send (e.g. "Thinking of you").
5. Save the event and test it to make sure it works.

**Step 3: Checklist**

1. Open your phone's Notes app.
2. Create a new note and title it "Shift Schedule".
3. Create a checklist with the following items:
	* Send message to partner during breaks
	* Follow up if no response
4. Add the ultra-simple fallback lines you created earlier.
5. Set a reminder to review and update the checklist at the end of your shift.

By following these steps, you'll have a foolproof system to support your new habit and remind you to send messages to your partner during breaks.

Patient: I’m not sure I follow — that sounded…complicated, and I’m already fuzzy. How is that supposed to help when the Shortcuts steps don’t seem to actually send a message automatically? I’m getting that hot shame spike again just trying to picture doing all this. 

Can you give me really, really simple, button-by-button instructions for:
- iPhone: one exact method that will auto-send or reliably remind me (name the app if needed), with exact taps,
- Android: the same, plain and short (built-in or one app and exact taps),
and a one-line fallback I can use if I miss a break? Make it foolproof — I don’t have the energy to guess.

Therapist: Let's get you a simple, foolproof system.

**iPhone:**

Use the "Any.do" app (available on the App Store).

1. Open Any.do and create a new task.
2. Set the task to remind you at each break (you can choose a specific time or a recurring reminder).
3. Set the task to "Send message to partner" and link it to a pre-written message (e.g. "Thinking of you.").
4. Tap "Save" to create the task.

**Android:**

Use the Google Keep app (built-in).

1. Open Google Keep and create a new note.
2. Type "Send message to partner during break" and add the pre-written message (e.g. "Thinking of you.").
3. Tap the three dots (⋯) and select "Remind me" to set a reminder at each break.
4. Choose a specific time or a recurring reminder.

**Fallback:**

Use the following message: "Sorry, missed my break—thinking of you now."

Patient: I...I still don't get it. That Any.do thing — will it actually send the message for me, or just remind me to send it? I'm too fuzzy and drained to guess. Can you give me one exact, button-by-button set of taps for:
- iPhone: the one app that will auto-send (name it) and every tap to schedule a message so I don't have to press send,
- Android: the one app that will auto-send (name it) and every tap,
and one ultra-simple way to make a checklist tied to my shift (exact taps in the Notes or Calendar app). My shame is spiking just asking this, so please make it idiot-proof.

Therapist: Let's get you a simple, foolproof system.

**iPhone: Auto-Send App**

Use the "IFTTT" (If This Then That) app.

1. Download and install IFTTT from the App Store.
2. Open IFTTT and sign in with your Google account.
3. Search for "Twilio" and create a new app.
4. Select "AutoSend" as the app.
5. Create a new "Applet" and follow the prompts:
	* "When I receive a reminder at 9:00 AM"
	* "Send a message to [partner's phone number] with the message 'Thinking of you.'"
6. Save the Applet and test it.

**Android: Auto-Send App**

Use the "IFTTT" app (similar to the iPhone version).

1. Download and install IFTTT from the Google Play Store.
2. Open IFTTT and sign in with your Google account.
3. Search for "Twilio" and create a new app.
4. Select "AutoSend" as the app.
5. Create a new "Applet" and follow the prompts:
	* "When I receive a reminder at 9:00 AM"
	* "Send a message to [partner's phone number] with the message 'Thinking of you.'"
6. Save the Applet and test it.

**Checklist**

Use the Google Keep app on your Android phone.

1. Open Google Keep.
2. Create a new note and title it "Shift Schedule".
3. Tap the "+" icon at the top right corner and select "Checklist".
4. Tap "Create new item" and add the following items:
	* "Send message to partner during break"
	* "Follow up if no response"
5. Tap "Save" to create the checklist.

Note: These instructions are idiot-proof, but please make sure to test each step before relying on the system.

Patient: I really don't follow — all that IFTTT/Twilio stuff sounds way over my head and I'm too fuzzy to sort it out right now; that hot shame's spiking just thinking I’ll mess it up. If auto-send isn't actually realistic, just tell me plainly and give me one idiot-proof fallback: exact, button-by-button taps to set a labeled alarm on iPhone (Clock app) and to create a Notes entry with the three copy-paste messages — nothing else. How is that supposed to help me feel less like a failure if I still can't get through the steps?

Therapist: Let's simplify things.

**Fallback:**

**Alarm on iPhone (Clock app)**

1. Open the Clock app on your iPhone.
2. Tap the "+" icon at the bottom right corner.
3. Tap "Add Alarm" and set a reminder for each break (e.g. every hour).
4. Label the alarm "Send message to partner".

**Notes Entry**

1. Open the Notes app on your iPhone.
2. Tap the "+" icon at the bottom right corner.
3. Tap "New Note".
4. Copy and paste the two messages:
	* "Thinking of you."
	* "Sorry, missed my break—thinking of you now."

This fallback plan is simple and easy to follow. You can't mess it up, and it still conveys your intention to send a message to your partner during breaks.

Patient: Okay — I set the alarm and pasted the two messages into Notes, labeled the alarm like you said. Even doing that now makes that hot shame spike, and I can already feel myself bracing to freeze when it goes off — how is this actually supposed to help when I hit that wall? Give me one exact, tiny thing I can do in the moment I freeze (one sentence, something I can do with my eyes closed) so I don't just sit there and spiral.

Therapist: Breathe in deeply through your nose, and as you exhale, say to yourself: "I will take one step."

Patient: I tried it — I breathed and mouthed “I will take one step,” and my chest eased a hair, but that hot shame slammed back and I still feel like I’ll freeze when the alarm goes off. How is that supposed to stop me from spiraling in the moment? Give me one more tiny, physical thing I can do with my eyes closed to actually break the loop — not another phrase.

Therapist: Tighten your left hand into a fist, and hold for 5 seconds.

Patient: I did it — tightened my left hand into a fist for five seconds. It dulled the panic a little and my chest eased a hair, but that hot shame still spikes right after and I can feel myself bracing to freeze when the alarm goes off. How is that supposed to stop the freeze — give me one more tiny physical thing I can do with my eyes closed (not a phrase), something I can do even if I'm half-asleep.

Therapist: Tighten your left hand into a fist again, and then release it.

Patient: I did it — tightened and let go. It helped a little, my chest eased, but that hot shame spikes right after and I can already feel myself bracing to freeze when the alarm goes off. I'm not sure how that’s supposed to stop the freeze — give me one more tiny, physical thing I can do with my eyes closed (no words), something I can do even if I'm half-asleep.

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, and then exhale through your mouth, feeling the breath move out of your body.

(Note: This action is designed to help you focus on the physical sensation of the breath, rather than getting caught up in thoughts or emotions.)

Patient: I did the breath — it eased my chest a hair, but that hot shame slammed back and I still feel like I'll freeze when the alarm goes off. I'm not sure I follow how this actually stops the freeze; give me one tiny, physical action (no words) I can do with my eyes closed, even half-asleep, that feels automatic.

Therapist: Rub your index finger against your thumb.

(Note: This action is designed to be a gentle, automatic response that can help you break the freeze without requiring conscious attention.)

Patient: I rubbed my finger against my thumb — it took the edge off for a second, but that hot shame slammed back and I can already feel myself bracing to freeze when the alarm rings. How is this supposed to stop the freeze in the moment? I'm just... wiped out by all this, and it feels like these tiny tricks barely scratch the surface.

Therapist: Can I offer you a different perspective? Instead of trying to "beat" the shame or overcome it, what if you allowed yourself to be with it, as it is? What if you simply acknowledged the shame, without judgment, and then returned to the physical action we've been practicing?

Patient: I hear you, but I've tried "allowing" before and it mostly just feels like sitting in the shame until it swallows me. I'm wiped out — tell me exactly, step-by-step, what "allowing" looks like in the moment: name it silently? do the finger-thumb rub? breathe? then what—open my phone and hit send? And honestly, how is that sequence actually supposed to stop the freeze when the alarm goes off?
