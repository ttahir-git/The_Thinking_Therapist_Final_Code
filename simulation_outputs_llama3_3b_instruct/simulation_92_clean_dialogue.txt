Patient: Lately I've been contending with a pervasive sadness and a marked lack of motivation that started after a major family conflict, and it's begun to erode both my relationship and my capacity to run the business. My instinct, being a business owner, is to intellectualize—mapping dynamics and constructing hypotheses—rather than actually sitting with the feeling, which I suspect perpetuates the stalemate. My generalized anxiety just amplifies the rumination, so I often feel paralyzed instead of productive.

Therapist: Can you describe what happens when you try to sit with this feeling of sadness or frustration? What do you typically do or what sensations do you experience in your body when you attempt to engage with it?

Patient: When I try to sit with the sadness my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, like there's a heavy knot under my ribs, and my stomach goes queasy and cold. Almost immediately I switch to analysis—cataloguing what happened, constructing theories about motives, rehearsing possible interventions—because thinking feels safer than feeling. That intellectualization blunts the immediate anxiety but leaves me numb and unmotivated, like I've exhausted myself avoiding the emotion.

Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a strong urge to avoid the emotional discomfort, but at the cost of feeling numb and unmotivated. Would you be willing to experiment with allowing yourself to feel this knot in your chest and queasiness in your stomach for just a short while, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I can try, though I should say up front my go-to is immediate intellectualization — cataloguing motives and contingency plans — which usually takes over within seconds. Could we make it a very short, contained trial (like 60 seconds) with you timing it and then asking me what I noticed? I’ll attempt to stay with the knot and my breath, but I’ll likely narrate it as I go and will tell you if it becomes too much.

Therapist: Let's do a 60-second trial. When I say "go," I want you to focus on your breath and the sensation in your chest and stomach, without trying to change or analyze it. You can simply acknowledge it as you go, like "Ah, this knot is here" or "My stomach feels queasy." We'll use a metronome to keep the time. Ready?

Patient: Okay, I'm ready. When you say "go" I'll try to focus on my breath and the knot in my chest—I can already feel the anticipatory anxiety and the urge to analyze, but I'll try to just name sensations as they come.

Therapist: Go.

Patient: Okay — my chest feels tight, like a band pressing under my ribs, and my breath is shallow and a bit rapid. There's a cold, queasy knot in my stomach that seems to tighten when I inhale. My shoulders are pulled up, tense, and already my mind is cataloguing possible causes and next steps instead of staying put with the sensations. I'm naming them as they come, but I can feel the analytic impulse rising.

Therapist: It sounds like the cataloguing impulse is strong, and that's okay. Can you notice what happens to your body or your mental state when you give in to that impulse to analyze? Does it feel like a release, or does it lead to getting more caught up in thoughts and feelings?

Patient: When I give in to the analysis it provides a fleeting illusion of control—my breathing might steady a little and the immediate panic backs off—but the knot in my chest doesn't actually dissipate; the body stays tense while my mind proliferates hypotheticals and contingency plans. It's a pseudo-relief that increases cognitive load and leaves me feeling more exhausted, demotivated, and oddly distant from the actual feeling. I'm frustrated with myself because it feels like avoidance dressed up as competence.

Therapist: It sounds like you're acknowledging that this avoidance strategy might be serving as a way to feel competent or in control, even if it's not truly addressing the underlying emotions. Can you think of a value or aspect of yourself that might be important to you, something that would be worth feeling uncomfortable or uncertain about, in order to connect with that feeling and actually move forward?

Patient: I think what's important to me is relational integrity — being present and reliable for my partner and not letting this conflict erode what we've built; that's something that feels worth tolerating discomfort for. I also value authenticity over performative competence, even though I often frame vulnerability as a strategic risk. Saying that still feels a bit abstract, but it gives me a concrete reason to try leaning into the discomfort.

Therapist: With a sense of relational integrity and authenticity guiding you, what would be a small, concrete action you could take in the next 24 hours to move forward with your business and partner, despite feeling uncomfortable or uncertain?

Patient: Okay — concretely: I'll schedule a 15‑minute check‑in with my partner tonight and say something simple and honest (like, "I've been feeling overwhelmed since the family conflict and it's affecting us") and invite their perspective rather than trying to solve it on the spot. For the business, I'll commit to one 25‑minute focused task (a Pomodoro) on a small, actionable item and then immediately delegate or list next steps so I don't get mired in paralysis. Before both, I'll do a two‑minute breathing grounding exercise to notice the knot without launching into analysis, even though I expect that narrating impulse to arise.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Before we wrap up, can you tell me what you think you'll feel like you've gained from committing to these small actions?

Patient: I think, theoretically, I'll gain a small restoration of agency—proof that I can take discrete steps even when I feel immobilized—and a modest reconnection with my partner so "relational integrity" isn't just an abstract value. Emotionally, I'd like to feel less hollow and a quieting of that persistent self-reproach, though I can already feel the familiar heat of shame and frustration at the prospect of trying and possibly failing again. That's me narrating it, of course, but the hope is tangible: less paralysis, slightly more presence. If those feelings of shame flare up, how would you suggest I keep going without getting derailed?

Therapist: Shame and frustration can be intense, but they can also be noticed and accepted as they are, without judgment. Would you like to try a brief defusion exercise with me, where we acknowledge and thank your mind for those feelings, and then gently bring your attention back to the concrete actions you've committed to taking?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the defusion exercise. There's that familiar hot shame and frustration already nudging me toward meta-commentary, and my energy feels pretty depleted, so I might slip into analysis, but I'll attempt to thank the thoughts and then gently bring attention back to the concrete actions. Let's do it.

Therapist: You've taken a big step by committing to these concrete actions and starting to defuse your thoughts. Can I ask: What's one small step you can take in the next hour to maintain this momentum, even if it feels uncomfortable or difficult?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how exactly does thanking the thoughts change what I do in the moment? Still, a concrete step: in the next hour I'll draft and send a one‑sentence text to my partner asking for the 15‑minute check‑in, then set a 15‑minute timer to do one focused business task. I can already feel that familiar prick of shame and the urge to overanalyze the wording, but I'll send it anyway and try to notice the feeling rather than immediately cataloguing solutions.

Therapist: It sounds like you've got a concrete plan to take the next step. As you draft and send that text to your partner, notice the physical sensations in your body, especially in your chest and stomach. Instead of trying to analyze or change those sensations, simply acknowledge them as they are, without judgment. Would you like to take a moment to do a brief breath check, right now, and simply notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow exactly how this changes anything, but okay — I'll try a breath check. My breaths are shallow; the band in my chest is still there and my stomach feels cold and tight, and already my head's generating explanations and a hot prick of shame. How long do you want me to stay with this before I send the text?

Therapist: I'd like you to stay with your breath and physical sensations for just 30 seconds more before sending the text. When you're ready, we'll check in again and see how you're feeling. Take your time, and remember, it's okay if your mind starts to wander – simply acknowledge the thought and gently bring your attention back to your breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow exactly how this changes things, but I'll do it. My breath is shallow; that band across my chest is still there and my stomach's clenching. My head is already busy rewording the text and running through worst‑case edits, with that hot prick of shame in the background. After about thirty seconds the tightness eased a fraction, but the commentary never stops. I'm going to send the one‑sentence text now and set the 15‑minute timer, even though I can feel the self‑critique gearing up — can you stay with me as I do that?

Therapist: I'll be with you as you send the text and start the timer. As you're typing, I want you to notice the self-critique that's arising, and instead of trying to change or silence it, I'd like you to thank it for its role in helping you prepare for the conversation. Can you say it with me: "Thank you, self-critique, for your efforts to help me prepare for this conversation"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how thanking it changes anything — it feels paradoxical, but I'll try. "Thank you, self-critique, for your efforts to help me prepare for this conversation." Saying that brings a hot flush of shame and a weary frustration; my head's already re-editing the text, so can you stay with me while I send it?

Therapist: I'm here with you as you send the text. Take your time, and as you're typing, I'd like you to continue to acknowledge the shame and frustration that's arising. Instead of trying to edit the text further, can you say to yourself, "May I be kind to myself as I send this text, even if it's not perfect"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this changes anything, but I'll try: "May I be kind to myself as I send this text, even if it's not perfect." Saying that brings a hot prick of shame and a weary tightness in my chest, and my head is already reediting—I'm going to send it and start the timer now; can you stay with me while I do that?

Therapist: I'm here with you as you send the text and start the timer. Take a deep breath and acknowledge that you've taken a significant step in reaching out to your partner and taking action towards your business. Can you give yourself a small, kind nod of acknowledgement for that, even if it feels imperfect or uncertain?

Patient: Okay — I give myself a small, tentative nod; it feels awkward and thin, more like a symbolic gesture than a real shift. There's that hot prick of shame and a heavy tiredness underneath, so the nod only moves the story a little bit and my chest is still tight. Can you stay with me while I notice whether that tiny acknowledgement changes the tightness at all?

Therapist: I'll stay with you as you continue to notice the physical sensations in your body. Can you bring your attention to the hot prick of shame and the tightness in your chest, and ask yourself: "Is this shame trying to tell me something about what I'm trying to achieve with this action?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that helps, but when I actually bring attention to the shame and the chest tightness the heat spikes and my breathing constricts. Conceptually, it seems like shame is signaling a perceived threat to my competence and relational standing—a defensive heuristic that pushes me into analysis and control instead of vulnerability, which, paradoxically, undermines the relational integrity I say I want. Saying that brings a weary flush of shame and irritation, and I'm already sliding into intellect again—can you stay with me while I try to sit with this for a moment?

Therapist: I'll stay with you as you sit with the shame and its related sensations. It's as if you're experiencing a kind of inner conflict between the desire for relational integrity and the defensive impulse to analyze and control. Can you take a deep breath and notice what's happening to your body when you feel the shame rising up, and what you'd like to happen instead?

Patient: When I actually slow down and notice the shame, my chest clamps, breathing shortens, there's that hot prick behind my ribs and my stomach goes cold — my system shifts into fight/defend and my mind immediately mobilizes into problem‑solving. What I'd like instead is for those sensations to ease enough that I can breathe more fully, tolerate the vulnerability, and stay present with my partner without reflexively turning it into an intellectual exercise — basically permission to be imperfect rather than perform competence. Saying that already saps me and the self‑reproach is flaring, so can you help me pick one tiny, concrete thing to do in the moment that would scaffold that tolerance?

Therapist: Let's start small. When you feel the chest clamping and the fight/defend response, can you bring your attention to your breath and notice the sensation of your fingers on the keyboard as you type out the next sentence? Focus on the physical sensation of your fingers on the keys, the feeling of the keyboard beneath your fingers, and the sound of the keys as you type. Can you stay with that sensation for just a few more seconds before continuing to type?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how focusing on my fingers changes things, but I'll try — my fingertips are cool on the keys, each press makes a thin click, and the keyboard feels slightly slick under my palms. My breath is still shallow and that hot shame spikes when I notice the clumsiness, which makes holding the sensation feel like a lot of effort, but I'm staying with it for a few more seconds before I finish typing.

Therapist: Now that you've finished typing, I'd like you to notice the physical sensations in your body, including the shame, and simply say to yourself: "This is just the sensation of shame" - no judgment, no analysis, just a neutral acknowledgment. Can you do that?

Patient: Okay—I can try: "This is just the sensation of shame." Saying it out loud is...thin. The heat spikes, my chest clamps tighter, and my head immediately starts rewriting the sentence and critiquing it; I'm irritated and kind of wiped out. I'm not sure I follow how this helps, but I want to keep trying—can you stay with me while I notice what happens next?

Therapist: I'll stay with you as you notice what happens next. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the heat in your chest and the clamping of your chest, and ask yourself: "What is the critical inner voice trying to tell me about this sensation?"

Patient: It tells me, bluntly, that the sensation is proof I'm failing — that this tightness equals incompetence and that if I show it I'll lose standing with my partner or in the business. The critic frames the bodily alarm as evidence demanding immediate remediation, so my mind jumps into contingency‑planning and control. Saying that out loud makes the heat spike and leaves me feeling drained and a bit foggy, like I can describe it but I can't actually make it stop.

Therapist: It sounds like the critical inner voice is very insistent and demanding. Can you try a different response to it? Instead of trying to silence it or disown it, can you say to yourself: "This is just a thought, and I've already done this before"? This acknowledges the thought without taking it on as true or reacting to it.

Patient: Okay — I'll try: "This is just a thought, and I've already done this before," even though it feels a bit performative and paradoxical. Saying it buys a tiny bit of distance, but the shame's heat spikes and a weary frustration washes over me while my mind immediately argues back, so the effect feels fragile; can you stay with me while I notice if that sliver holds at all?

Therapist: I'll stay with you as you notice the fragile distance. Can you bring your attention to the shame and the critical inner voice, and ask yourself: "What would happen if you didn't try to respond to this thought? What would be the difference if you simply allowed it to be there without trying to push it away or argue with it?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — conceptually, not responding could produce habituation and decouple the critic from the cascade of defensive behaviors, preventing it from reifying into action. In practice, when I try that the heat spikes, my chest clamps, breathing shortens and I feel drained and foggy, so the theory sounds plausible but the execution feels like wading through molasses. Still, I'm willing to experiment: can we do a brief 30‑second practice now where I simply allow the thought and sensations without responding, with you timing me and staying with me afterward?

Therapist: I'll start the timer for 30 seconds. As soon as you feel the heat spike, the clamping of your chest, or any other physical sensations, I'll ask you to notice them exactly as they are, without trying to change them or respond to them. You can say to yourself "This is just the sensation of shame" or "This is just the feeling of tightness in my chest" - simply acknowledge the sensation, without judgment or analysis. We'll stop the timer when it goes off. Are you ready?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. My chest's already clamping and that familiar hot shame is nagging, so the 30 seconds feels small but heavy; start the timer and I'll notice the sensations without reacting.

Therapist: Timer started. Go ahead and begin noticing the sensations without trying to change or respond to them. When you feel ready, I'll start the timer again after 30 seconds, and we'll see if the sensation has changed. (silence)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow exactly how that helps, but I did it. The first few seconds the heat spiked and the chest clamp felt almost sharper, my breathing stayed shallow, and my head immediately started annotating the experience—classifying it, predicting outcomes. After maybe twenty seconds there was a tiny loosening, like a paperweight shifted a fraction, but the critic was still there, whispering that this was evidence of failure. Saying that aloud fatigues me; I feel drained and a bit foggy, and yet I'm here—wanting to know whether that small loosening is something we can build on or if it was just a fluke.

Therapist: The tiny loosening is indeed something to build on. Let's explore it further. Can you take a moment to notice the sensation of that loosening, without trying to change or analyze it? What does it feel like, exactly? Is it a sense of relaxation, a release, or something else?

Patient: It's a very small, almost imperceptible easing — like the band loosens a notch and there's a tiny, cooler space on the inhale, not a full relaxation or release. My reflex is immediately to objectify it — label it a "micro‑release" and predict its decay — and that prediction brings a familiar sting of shame and frustration, which makes holding the loosening feel effortful and precarious. How do you suggest we scaffold that sliver so it doesn't evaporate the moment my brain narrates it away?
