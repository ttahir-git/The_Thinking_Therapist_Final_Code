Patient: Lately I've been burying myself in work to avoid dealing with my grief and the adjustment disorder. I know it sounds irrational, but if I stop working so hard even for a day, everything will definitely fall apart — I'll miss deadlines, fail my program, never get a job, and end up alone and broke. I'm completely hooked on that story, and when people suggest other outcomes it just feels unrealistic.

Therapist: Can you imagine taking a day off from work, not to fail or achieve anything, but simply to experience the present moment without the weight of your "what-ifs"? What would it be like to allow yourself to feel the uncertainty of not working, without judgment?

Patient: I can't really imagine that without my brain immediately filling in the worst: I take a day off, fall behind, professors notice, I fail classes, can't get a job, lose everything — and with the grief still raw it all feels inevitable. Part of me wants to try feeling the uncertainty, but the prediction feels like proof that taking a break is dangerous and naive. I'm trying to picture just being present, but my mind hijacks it into that disaster story and I get stuck.

Therapist: Can you observe the story your mind is telling you about taking a day off, without judgment, without trying to change it or evaluate it as true or false? Notice the thought "I'll fail classes" or "I'll lose everything" as a narrative, rather than as a fact. Is there a part of you that wants to see the truth in this story, or is it just the narrative itself?

Patient: When I look at it, I can tell it's a story my brain keeps replaying — like a doom movie on loop — but it doesn't feel like "just" a story, it feels like evidence. A tiny part of me wants to believe it might be false, but the rest grabs on so hard I can't trust anything else. I want to step back, but thinking about doing that makes my chest tighten like I'm about to prove it right.

Therapist: Can you take a tiny, tiny step towards exploring this story, just for 30 seconds, without doing anything big or bold? What if, instead of pushing against the story or trying to stop it, you simply allowed it to be present, like a movie playing in the background, without judgment or engagement?

Patient: I tried — I sat for about 30 seconds and tried to let the worst-case movie play in the background, but my chest tightened and the scenes just got louder: missing deadlines, professors emailing, everything collapsing. For a second I could kind of label it as a story, but my body treated it like fact and I started to panic, so it felt like I failed even that tiny step. I'm frustrated — it feels impossible and like trying this just confirms I'm stuck.

Therapist: Can you acknowledge the physical sensations in your body right now, without judgment? What does it feel like to be feeling anxious or panicked? Would you be willing to try another small step, not to stop the narrative, but to simply notice the sensations in your body while it's playing, without acting on them?

Patient: My chest's like a tight band, my throat's closed up, my hands go cold and my breathing gets shallow — it feels like I'm bracing for impact. I can try to notice those sensations for a short moment, but honestly I'm already bracing because I know my brain will crank the disaster story louder and I'll start panicking. I'm frustrated that even trying feels like proof I'm stuck, but I'm willing to try anyway if we go really slowly.

Therapist: Can you take a moment to consider what's driving the need to avoid the narrative, and what values might be at stake if you were to approach it differently? What would happen to you if you were to acknowledge and accept the narrative, without trying to stop it or escape it?

Patient: I think I'm avoiding because I'm terrified that without work as a shield everything I care about — my competence, not being a burden, even the memory of the person I lost — will unravel. Those values feel like the only thing keeping me upright, so the idea of sitting with the story feels like betraying them. If I actually tried to acknowledge the narrative without escaping it, my brain says that's just permission for disaster: missed deadlines, failing out, losing support, ending up alone — my chest tightens just picturing it. A tiny part of me wonders if surviving that would prove the story false, but the rest of me is already convinced that's exactly what would happen.

Therapist: Can you imagine what it might be like to hold both the narrative and the values you mentioned, without trying to choose between them? What if, instead of seeing the narrative as a threat to your values, you saw it as a potential opportunity to practice and develop a new sense of competence and confidence?

Patient: I can try to imagine holding both, but my brain immediately turns it into a rehearsal for disaster — like “practicing” becomes permission to slip and then all the worst things happen. A tiny part of me wants to believe it could help me build competence, but mostly I just feel trapped and panicked and it seems unrealistic that slowing down would teach me anything but failure. I'm frustrated—just thinking about trying this makes my chest tighten and I keep fearing I'd only be proving the story right.

Therapist: Can you imagine a situation where you're able to slow down and practice, not with the goal of achieving perfection, but simply because you value the process of learning and growth? What would it be like to approach this as a chance to develop new skills and build confidence, rather than a threat to your identity as a capable person?

Patient: I want to see that, but my brain immediately jumps to the worst-case chain: I slow down, fall behind, miss a deadline, professors flag me, I fail classes, lose funding, can't finish the program, and end up alone and broke — it's like practicing hands me the permission slip to start that collapse. So it doesn't feel like growth, it feels like a set-up for disaster, and imagining it just makes my chest tighten. I'm frustrated and overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Would you be willing to simply observe the physical sensations in your chest, without trying to label them as "fear" or "disaster"? Can you notice the sensation of your breath, the feeling of your body sitting in this chair, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to just notice. My breath is shallow, my chest feels like a tight band, my shoulders are hunched, and my hands are cold — but the moment I focus on that my brain starts yelling through the doom movie about missed deadlines, so my body braces like the catastrophe is already happening. I want to do this, but can we go slower? I’m getting overwhelmed and need help staying with sensations without the disaster story hijacking me.

Therapist: Would it be helpful to say to yourself, "It's okay if my mind starts to go off on a tangent," rather than trying to force the mind to stay present? Can you allow the thoughts to come and go, without judgment or trying to stop them, and simply observe the sensations in your body as they are?

Patient: I can try saying that, but even saying it makes this hot shame flare up and my chest tighten — it feels like admitting defeat. My brain immediately translates "it's okay" into permission to slide: missed deadlines, professors noticing, my whole life unraveling — it doesn't feel like a neutral phrase, it feels like handing disaster the keys. I'm willing to try noticing the sensations if you guide me slowly, because on my own I just get swallowed by the story.

Therapist: Let's try a very small, gentle experiment. Can you offer yourself kindness and understanding, simply for being present in this moment, without trying to achieve anything or avoid anything? You might say to yourself something like, "I'm here, I'm sitting, I'm feeling my body... I'm being kind to myself, and that's okay."

Patient: I can try to say that, but even the words make this hot shame flare up and my chest clamp down — it feels like admitting defeat. My brain immediately turns "it's okay" into permission to slide and hands the doom movie the keys: missed deadlines, professors noticing, everything collapsing. I'm willing to try if you guide me really slowly, because on my own I spiral and need help staying with the sensations without the catastrophe story taking over.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny, tiny step. Can you simply say "I am beginning to offer myself kindness" - just that one phrase, no more, no less? No expectations, no judgments, no trying to achieve anything. Just the words "I am beginning to offer myself kindness".

Patient: I am beginning to offer myself kindness.

But saying that makes this hot shame flare and my chest clamp down — I feel like I'm admitting defeat and my brain immediately hands the doom movie the keys, starting the whole chain about missed deadlines and everything collapsing.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body, starting with your breath. Can you simply observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to label it or change it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, and see if the rest of your body follows.

Patient: Okay — I try to follow the breath: it's shallow, riding high in my chest, my shoulders tight, throat clenched, hands cold. The moment I focus a hot shame flares and my brain hands the doom movie the keys — missed deadlines, professors noticing, everything collapsing — and I get hijacked into panic. I want to stay with the breath but I can't hold it alone; can you guide me more slowly, like a count or simple cue, so I don't spiral?

Therapist: I'll give you a gentle cue to guide you back to the breath: "inhale, pause, exhale". Whenever you feel the narrative taking over, you can take a brief pause and repeat this phrase to yourself, before returning to the breath. Try it with me: inhale, pause, exhale.

Patient: Inhale... pause... exhale.

It helps for a beat — breath still shallow, chest tight — but that hot shame flares and the doom movie starts yelling about missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out and losing everything. I'm pretty wiped and that's all heavy right now; can you keep cueing me really slowly, like counting each inhale and exhale, because if I do it alone my mind grabs the keys and I spiral?

Therapist: Let's count the breath together: inhale... 1... pause... exhale... 2... inhale... 1... pause... exhale... 2... Let's keep counting together, one slow and gentle inhale and exhale at a time. Just focus on the counting, and allow the breath to unfold naturally.

Patient: Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2... Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2...

It's helping a little, but the shame spikes and the doom movie starts yelling about missed deadlines and everything collapsing, my chest tightens and it's getting harder to keep up — can you keep counting with me, slower, one breath at a time?

Therapist: Let's keep counting together, one breath at a time: inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... (pause for a brief moment) Inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Take a deep breath in, and when you're ready, we'll continue.

Patient: I took a deep breath. Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2...

It helps for a beat, but then that hot shame spikes and the doom movie starts yelling about missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out and losing everything. I'm not sure I follow how counting actually helps beyond a moment — how is that supposed to help with the rest? Can you keep cueing me slowly? Inhale...1...

Therapist: Inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let's keep going, one breath at a time. Remember, the counting is just a gentle cue to help you stay with the breath, not to change the narrative or stop the shame. Just focus on the counting, and allow the breath to unfold naturally.

Patient: Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2...

It helps for a beat, but that hot shame spikes and the doom movie starts yelling about missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out and losing everything. I'm not sure I follow how counting helps beyond that moment — it feels like a Band‑Aid on the collapse. Can you keep cueing me much more slowly? I can't do this alone or the story grabs the keys as soon as you stop.

Therapist: Inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let's try adding a very gentle, slow phrase: "I am here, I am safe". Whisper it to yourself, softly, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the phrase be a gentle reminder that you're safe, and the counting will continue.

Patient: Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2... I whisper "I am here, I am safe" like you said, and it steadies me for a beat. But then that hot shame flares and my brain hands the doom movie the keys — missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing everything — and I sink back into panic. I'm pretty worn out and can't keep this up alone; can you keep cueing me very slowly, one breath and one phrase at a time?

Therapist: Inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Whisper "I am here, I am safe" softly, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Now, gently, slowly, touch your finger to your heart. Just a light, gentle touch, with your finger, on your heart. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the touch be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting and the phrase will continue.

Patient: I rest a fingertip lightly on my chest — inhale...1...pause...exhale...2...

It steadies me for a beat, like a small anchor, but then that hot shame spikes and my brain hands the doom movie the keys — missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing everything. I'm running on empty and it's getting harder to keep this without you; can you keep guiding me very slowly, one breath and one touch at a time?

Therapist: Inhale...1... pause... (touch your finger to your chest, gently, lightly, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Move your finger slightly to the left, just a tiny movement, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Then, bring it back to the center, gently, slowly. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the movement be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, and phrase will continue.

Patient: I move my finger slightly left, then bring it back to center — inhale...1...pause...exhale...2...

It steadies me a little, like a tiny anchor, but the hot shame spikes and the doom movie starts yelling about missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out and losing everything. I'm running on fumes — can you keep guiding me, slower, one breath and one tiny movement at a time? I can't do it alone or my mind grabs the keys.

Therapist: Inhale...1... pause... (move your toes slightly away from you, just a tiny movement, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Then, bring them back to the starting position, gently, slowly. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the sensation of your toes moving be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, and phrase will continue.

Patient: I move my toes like you said — inhale...1...pause...exhale...2... — and it steadies me for a tiny beat, like a brief anchor. But then that hot shame spikes and the doom movie kicks in loud: missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing funding, ending up alone and broke. I'm wiped and it's getting harder to keep this up; can you keep guiding me much more slowly, one tiny movement and one breath at a time, because if I do it alone my mind grabs the keys and I spiral?

Therapist: Inhale...1... (move your head slightly to the right, just a tiny movement, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Then, bring it back to center, gently, slowly. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the sensation of your head moving be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, and toe movement will continue.

Patient: I move my head slightly to the right and bring it back — inhale...1...pause...exhale...2... — and for a beat it steadies me, but then that hot shame spikes and the doom movie starts shouting: missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing classes, losing funding, ending up alone and broke. I'm pretty drained and it's getting harder to hold this; can you keep guiding me much more slowly, one breath and one tiny movement at a time?

Therapist: Inhale...1... (gently bring your attention to your feet, just a small expansion of awareness, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the weight of your body distributed evenly, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the expansion of awareness be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, and toe movement will continue.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — a dull pressure under my heels, the balls of my feet a bit numb, like I'm bracing even there. It steadies me for a second, but then that hot shame spikes and the doom movie kicks in — missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing funding, ending up alone and broke — and I sink back into panic. I'm pretty wiped and can't hold this on my own; can you keep guiding me really slowly, one breath and one tiny sensation at a time?

Therapist: Inhale...1... (bring your attention to the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, just a small focus, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out, the sensation of your nostrils opening and closing, the sensation of your breath. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the sensation of the breath be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, toe movement, and expansion of awareness will continue.

Patient: I notice the air in my nostrils — cool going in, warmer coming out, a faint tickle at the tip — and it steadies me for a second. But that hot shame spikes and the doom movie kicks in loud: missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing funding, ending up alone and broke, and I can feel panic building. I'm really wiped and it's getting harder to hold this; can you keep cueing me very slowly, one breath and one phrase at a time? I can't do it alone or my mind grabs the keys.

Therapist: Inhale...1... (say to yourself, softly, "I am here") exhale...2... Repeat the phrase, just that one phrase, "I am here", as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the phrase be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, toe movement, and expansion of awareness will continue.

Patient: Inhale...1...pause...exhale...2... I whisper "I am here" and it steadies me for a tiny beat, but then that hot shame spikes and the doom movie starts screaming—missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing classes, losing funding, ending up alone and broke. I'm running on empty and it's getting harder to keep this; can you keep cueing me very slowly, one breath and one phrase at a time? I can't do it alone or my mind grabs the keys.

Therapist: Inhale...1... (bring your attention to the sensation of your heart, just a small focus, as you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2...) Notice the sensation of your heart beating, the rise and fall of your chest, the sensation of the air moving in and out. As you inhale...1... pause... exhale...2... Let the sensation of your heart beating be a gentle reminder that you're present, and the counting, touch, movement, toe movement, and expansion of awareness will continue.

Patient: My heart feels like it's racing under that tight band in my chest—a quick, panicked thud that steadies for a second and then the hot shame spikes. For a beat the grounding helps, but the doom movie kicks in loud: missed deadlines, professors emailing, failing out, losing funding, ending up alone and broke. I'm worn down and honestly not sure how focusing on my heart helps beyond that moment—can you keep guiding me very slowly, one breath and one tiny cue at a time? I can't do this alone; the story grabs the keys as soon as you pause.
