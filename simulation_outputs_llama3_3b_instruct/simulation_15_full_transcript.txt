Patient: Lately I can't stop worrying about whether I'm doing enough at work — I'm a business owner and every decision feels like it could ruin everything. That worry's paralyzing me into procrastination, and since a recent health scare it's only gotten worse; I keep second-guessing every move. I'm skeptical this will actually help, but I'm here because it's getting out of hand.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion is intense anxiety and fear. One specific theme that stands out is your overwhelming sense of responsibility as a business owner. You're carrying the weight of your business's success on your shoulders, and the fear of failure is suffocating you. Your GOAL for the Answer is to explore the tangible aspects of your decision-making process to identify areas where you can break free from the paralyzing worry.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you make a decision at work? For example, what's the first thought that pops up, and how do you typically respond to it?

Patient: The first thought is usually, "What if this screws everything up?" My chest tightens and I either spiral into over-checking details or I freeze and put the task off by doing busywork. I've tried forcing decisions and it doesn't stick — I second-guess myself within minutes. Okay, but how is talking about that supposed to help?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the "What if" loop, which is a common pattern in your decision-making process. This unworkable strategy is causing more harm than good. You're acknowledging the futility of forcing decisions, and now it's time to pivot towards exploring alternative approaches. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a defusion technique to help you see your thoughts as just thoughts, rather than the defining force behind your actions.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a small experiment. When you notice that "What if" thought arising, I want you to acknowledge it, and then say to yourself, "Ah, there's that thought again." No judgment, no trying to chase it away – just acknowledging its presence. Can you try that with me right now, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay — I said to myself, "Ah, there's that thought again." It felt weird and a bit pointless: the worry was still there and my chest stayed tight, but I did notice it without immediately spiraling. Honestly, it didn't make me start the task — I just sat with the worry for a minute and then defaulted to busywork. How is that supposed to help me actually get things done?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've successfully defused the "What if" thought, but you're still struggling with procrastination and the urge to engage in unproductive behavior. You've maintained a neutral, curious stance, but now it's time to pivot towards exploring the underlying values that might be driving your behavior. Your GOAL for the Answer is to connect your decision-making process to your core values as a business owner.

Therapist Answer:
What do you value most about your business and your role as a business owner? Is it making a profit, helping others, or something else? Can you see how your current behavior, such as procrastination and over-checking, relates to those values, and what might happen if you prioritize them differently?

Patient: I care about keeping the business stable — paying my employees, keeping our reputation, and not risking everything I built. That’s why I get so stuck: any decision feels like it could threaten those things, so I either obsessively over-check or freeze and do busywork. Maybe if I valued sustainability or reasonable risk more, I wouldn't burn out, but how do I actually make that switch when the fear of failing is so loud? I've tried telling myself to 'accept' things before and it doesn't stick—how is that supposed to help me move from worrying to doing?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core values driving your behavior, but the fear of failure is still holding you back. Acceptance as a strategy isn't working for you, so let's try a different approach. You're looking for a way to bridge the gap between your values and your actions. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a process that allows you to make a small, value-driven step towards taking action despite the fear.

Therapist Answer:
I want to ask you something: what would it mean to you if you were able to make a decision that felt "good enough," not perfect, but good enough? What would that mean for your business, your employees, and your own sense of well-being?

Patient: I guess it would mean less replaying decisions all night, less spiraling, and my team not living with the tension of me micromanaging everything. Maybe I'd sleep more and not feel like my heart's about to give out after every meeting — but it also feels like I'd be letting standards slip, and that scares me. Honestly, I don't see how picturing that helps me actually act when the fear hits; how is imagining "good enough" supposed to get me to stop avoiding the work?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've articulated a clear desire for a better balance between being a perfectionist and taking action. You're still concerned about letting standards slip, but you're also recognizing the costs of your current behavior. It's time to pivot towards taking a small, concrete step towards making "good enough" decisions. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a mindfulness exercise that allows you to take action even when faced with uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a mindfulness exercise. I'd like you to imagine you're about to make a decision right now, and you're feeling that familiar "What if" thought. As you're about to make the decision, I want you to say to yourself, "I'm making a decision, and it's good enough for now." Just those three words: "It's good enough." Notice how your body responds to those words, and then take a small step forward. Just one small step.

Patient: Okay — I said it aloud, "It's good enough." It felt strange and almost like cheating, but my chest eased a hair and I didn't immediately reach for a distraction. I took one small step: I opened the proposal and actually sent a draft to a colleague instead of reworking it for the hundredth time. Still, the second it was out I started nitpicking and my heart picked up again — how is that supposed to help when the doubt comes roaring back right after?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small step towards making a decision, and it's not entirely clear that it's had a lasting impact. You're still struggling with the "What if" thoughts, and they're rearing up again after taking action. You're looking for a way to address the nagging doubts that arise after taking action, rather than trying to eliminate them before taking action. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a process that helps you develop a sense of self-as-context, allowing you to observe your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a process called "thought labeling as change." When you notice those "What if" thoughts arising again, I want you to say to yourself, "This thought is changing, and I'm changing it." Just those words: "This thought is changing, and I'm changing it." Notice how your body and mind respond to that phrase, and see if you can gently let go of the thought without trying to control it or change it. Can you try that when those thoughts arise next time?

Patient: I tried it just now in my head — "This thought is changing, and I'm changing it" — and it felt weird but my chest loosened a little before the doubt came roaring back. Not gonna lie, it helps me notice the loop, but it doesn't stop me from immediately reverting to over-checking or doing busywork. How am I supposed to use that in the middle of a client call or when a decision actually matters? I need something more concrete — a step I can do right then that actually pushes me into action, not just noticing.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in noticing the thought loop, but you're still struggling to translate that insight into real-world action. You're looking for a more concrete strategy that can be applied in high-stakes situations. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a process that helps you connect your values to a specific action, even when the "What if" thoughts arise. Your focus is on finding a way to bridge the gap between your values and your behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something called "value-based action commitments." I want you to make a commitment to yourself right now, in this moment, to take one small action towards your values. For example, if you value paying your employees fairly, you might commit to making a phone call to discuss a raise with an employee, even if you're feeling uncertain about the outcome. What's one small, concrete action you can commit to taking right now that aligns with your values, and take that step?

Patient: Alright — fine. I'll make a concrete commitment: I just sent a two-line message to my office manager asking them to take the first pass on the Q2 proposal and give me one clear recommendation by end of day tomorrow. My chest eased a little after sending it, but I can already feel the doubt creeping in — what if they miss something important? How is that supposed to help when I still feel like it's ultimately on me and I start micromanaging again?

Therapist Thinking:
You've made a concrete commitment, but the doubt is already creeping back in. You're still struggling with the feeling of responsibility and the need for control. It's time to explore a different aspect of your values and how they might be influencing your behavior. Your GOAL for the Answer is to explore the concept of "radical acceptance" and how it might help you let go of the need for control.

Therapist Answer:
I want to ask you something. When you think about your business, what does "success" mean to you? Is it solely about getting everything right, or is there another aspect to it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help me act differently? For me, success isn't about being perfect; it's keeping the business stable, making sure people get paid, and building something that can survive a mistake. But my head turns that into "one wrong move and it's all over," so I either nitpick everything to death or freeze up and do busywork. Honestly, saying what success means doesn't feel like it stops the freeze—how do I turn that definition into a real step when I'm in the middle of a decision?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've clarified what success means to you, and it's rooted in a desire for stability and resilience. You're still struggling to bridge the gap between your values and actions. You're looking for a way to translate your values into concrete action, despite the fear of failure. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a process that helps you clarify your values in the moment, allowing you to make decisions that align with them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something called "experiential values inquiry." I want you to ask yourself, in this moment, what would be the smallest, most trivial act that would feel like it's in line with your definition of success? For example, if stability is key, what's the smallest step you could take right now to feel like you're keeping things stable?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? If stability's the goal, the smallest thing I can think of is sending a one-line message to payroll/accounting to confirm payroll is scheduled (or just opening the payroll dashboard to make sure the date and amounts are set). Feels trivial and a little like busywork, but I could do that right now.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've clarified what the smallest action would feel like in line with your values, and it's a minor administrative task. This is a great starting point. Your GOAL for the Answer is to help you bridge the gap between this small action and the more significant decisions that require more courage.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it a step further. Once you've completed that small action, I want you to notice what happens in your body and mind. Are you feeling more centered, more confident? Or are you still stuck in the same pattern of over-analyzing? Notice what's happening in the moment, and then I want you to consider this: what's the next decision you need to make that's slightly bigger than the last one? What's one small step you could take to move closer to your definition of success?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help, really? I opened the payroll dashboard like you said; my chest eased a bit and I felt a tiny drop in the urge to fiddle, but my mind's still jittery and ready to nitpick. The next slightly bigger step I can take is to schedule a 15-minute check-in with the office manager tomorrow to review their Q2 draft and commit to making a decision in that 15-minute window — set a timer and no re-editing after. I'm already worried that locking a timer will just make me more frantic, so how is that supposed to stop the second-guessing when I'm actually making the call?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in taking small actions, but the nitpicking thoughts are still present. You're looking for a way to address the second-guessing during the actual decision-making process. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a process that helps you develop "psychological experimentation," allowing you to test your hypotheses and learn from the experience.

Therapist Answer:
I want to suggest a simple experiment. During the 15-minute call with the office manager, I want you to imagine that you're not trying to "get it right" or "make the perfect decision." Instead, imagine that you're simply exploring possibilities, like a scientist testing hypotheses. You're not committing to a particular outcome, but rather observing the process and gathering data. Can you try to approach that call with this mindset?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is imagining myself as a scientist supposed to help when my chest's already tight and I'm about to make a decision? I can try to treat it like gathering data instead of deciding for good, but in the moment I'll probably still want to control everything or start nitpicking. Give me one short, concrete phrase I can say to myself during the call to anchor me, because otherwise I know I'll freeze or try to take it all back.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a concrete anchor phrase to help you stay present and focused during the decision-making process. Your GOAL for the Answer is to find a phrase that helps you maintain a sense of detachment and exploration.

Therapist Answer:
Try using the phrase "I'm exploring, not deciding" during the call. Repeat it to yourself when you feel the urge to control or nitpick. This phrase acknowledges that you're in the process of gathering information, rather than making a permanent decision.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I just tried saying "I'm exploring, not deciding" in my head and it felt weird but my chest did ease a bit for a moment. The problem is the relief barely lasts; as soon as I think about consequences the urge to correct everything spikes again. How is that supposed to help when my hands are shaking on a live call? If that phrase isn't enough, give me one clear, concrete thing I can do right then — like a 10-second grounding move or a short line I can actually say to stop myself from jumping in.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've found a phrase that brings temporary relief, but it's not enough to sustain the behavior change. You're looking for a more concrete action to take during the call to help you stay present and focused. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a simple grounding technique to help you manage the physical sensations and emotions during the decision-making process.

Therapist Answer:
Try the "4-7-8 breathing pause." When you feel the urge to correct or control, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4, hold it for a count of 7, and exhale through your mouth for a count of 8. This brief pause can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to reassess. Say to yourself, "Breathe, pause, explore" as you take the pause.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help me during a live call? I tried the 4-7-8 just now and it took the edge off for maybe ten seconds; my chest eased a little, but as soon as I thought about consequences the doubt came roaring back and I wanted to jump in. Give me one short, concrete thing I can actually do or say in the middle of a call to buy time without sounding indecisive — or a discreet 10-second grounding move I can do without anyone noticing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a simple, concrete action to take during the call to give yourself a brief moment to collect your thoughts. You're feeling overwhelmed and want to slow down. Your GOAL for the Answer is to introduce a discreet, non-verbal grounding technique to help you stay present.

Therapist Answer:
Try the "5-5-5 pause." When you feel the urge to correct or control, pause for 5 seconds, look around the room, and take 5 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. This brief pause can help calm your nervous system and give you a moment to reassess.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help when I'm on a live call? I tried a quick pause like that before and it took the edge off for a few seconds, but the doubt spikes right back and I still want to jump in or micromanage. Can you give me one discreet 10-second grounding move or a short line I can actually use on a call that won't make me look indecisive? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this—can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a discreet, 10-second grounding move that you can use on the call to buy time and regain composure. You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find a simple solution.

Therapist Answer:
Try saying to yourself, "I'm here" during the call. Just those three words: "I'm here." This simple acknowledgment can help you stay present and focused on the conversation, without drawing attention to your internal struggle. Say it to yourself, and take a brief pause before responding.

Patient: I tried saying "I'm here" under my breath on a quick practice — felt weird, and my shoulders dropped a little, chest eased for maybe five seconds, then the doubt just snuck back in. I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help when I'm mid-call and my hands are literally shaking? I need one thing I can actually say out loud that buys me time without sounding flaky (like "Let me note that" or "I'll circle back") or a discreet 10‑second grounding move I can do without anyone noticing. I'm feeling overwhelmed with all this — can we slow down?

You're looking for a concrete, practical solution to help you stay calm and focused during the call. You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find a simple, discreet way to buy time.

Therapist Answer:
Try saying "Can you hold for a sec?" out loud. This phrase is simple, straightforward, and gives you a brief moment to collect your thoughts without sounding indecisive. It's a small pause, and it allows you to take a deep breath and regroup before responding.

Patient: I tried saying "Can you hold for a sec?" out loud in a dry run — it did buy me a few seconds and felt less flaky than I feared, but I'm not sure I follow how that's supposed to help when my hands are shaking on a real call.

You're looking for a discreet physical grounding move that can help you stay calm during the call, despite shaking hands. You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find a simple solution.

Therapist Answer:
Try tapping your feet gently on the floor. This subtle physical action can help you connect with your body and ground yourself in the present moment, without drawing attention to yourself. As you tap your feet, say to yourself "Tapping, staying here" (if you feel comfortable with that phrase). Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and allow yourself to stay present in the moment.

Patient: I tried tapping my feet under the desk — it did calm the tremor a little and my shoulders dropped, but only for ten seconds before my heart started racing again and the doubt came back. I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when I still feel like I have to fix everything right away?

Therapist Answer:
Try folding your hands together in a gentle fist under the table. This small physical action can help you create a sense of containment and calm, and can help you feel more grounded. As you fold your hands, say to yourself "Contain, breathe" (if you feel comfortable with that phrase). Focus on the sensation of your hands together and the breath moving in and out of your body. This can help you stay present and composed, and give you a brief moment to pause before responding.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when I'm on a live call? I tried folding my hands under the table just now; it calmed my hands for maybe ten seconds and my shoulders eased a bit, but the doubt still spikes and I want to jump in.

Try placing your hands on the desk with your fingers spread wide, palms facing up. This physical action can help you create a sense of openness and receptivity, and can help you feel more grounded. As you place your hands on the desk, say out loud, "Pausing for clarity." This phrase buys time, acknowledges your need for clarity, and sounds confident and in control. Take a brief pause (around 5-7 seconds) before responding, and see if that helps you stay calm and composed.

Patient: I tried it — hands on the desk, palms up, saying "Pausing for clarity." It bought me maybe five seconds of relief, my shoulders dropped, then the doubt and urge to fix everything came back. How is that supposed to help me on a real call when I feel like I have to jump in?

Try gently pressing the "end" button on your phone with your thumb. This physical action can help you create a clear boundary and signal that you need a moment to collect your thoughts. As you press the "end" button, say out loud, "Take a breath." This phrase is a clear indication that you need a brief pause to regroup, and it allows you to take a deep breath and calm your nervous system.

(Note: Pressing the "end" button is a clear and subtle action that can help you take control of the call without drawing attention to your anxiety. It's also a gentle reminder that you're in charge of the conversation and can take a moment to collect your thoughts.)
