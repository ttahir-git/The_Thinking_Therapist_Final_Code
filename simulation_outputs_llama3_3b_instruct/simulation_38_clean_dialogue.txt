Patient: Hi — I've been ruminating a lot about this persistent sense of stasis since my breakup and the burnout at work. It feels like my identity has compressed into the single variable of "software developer," and I've been trying to analytically map out other axes of meaning but keep getting stuck in abstractions. I know I intellectualize my feelings a lot, but basically I'm directionless and unsure what actually matters to me beyond my job.

Therapist: Can you elaborate on what you mean by "analytically mapping out other axes of meaning"? What do you hope to gain by doing this, and how does it feel when you get stuck in abstractions?

Patient: Mostly I mean I try to formalize this into a model—listing values, hobbies, identities, and weighting them like features in a vector—to see what combination might produce a livable sense of self beyond 'engineer'. I'm hoping that by quantifying and organizing it I can regain some agency and resilience, so a relationship ending or a rough quarter at work doesn't utterly deflate me. But when I get stuck in abstractions it feels like semantic paralysis: lots of elegant frameworks, no gut-level pull, and this weird buffering state where I'm both relieved I'm being "rational" and frustrated/quietly anxious that I'm avoiding actually feeling anything.

Therapist: Can you describe what happens in that "buffering state" when you feel like you're avoiding emotions? What's the sensation like when you're in that state, and how does it relate to the relief of being "rational"?

Patient: It's like my affect gets dialed down to a monotone—there's this cognitive fog, a mild chest tightness, and my inner narrative shifts into meta-mode: cataloguing, hypothesizing, and systematizing instead of actually experiencing. Being "rational" functions as a regulation strategy; it gives a pseudo-sense of control and predictability, so the sudden spikes of vulnerability after the breakup or at work feel less catastrophic. But that safety is thin—alongside the relief there's this low-grade irritation and anxiousness that I'm dodging real contact with what hurts, which just fuels more analysis. I don't know exactly how to breach that loop without feeling exposed—does that make sense, or am I just over-intellectualizing it again?

Therapist: It sounds like you're acknowledging the importance of safety, but also recognizing that it comes with a cost. Would you be willing to explore what would happen if you didn't prioritize "rational control" in these situations, but instead made space for a more embodied experience of emotions? What's the worst that could happen if you allowed yourself to feel the vulnerability, even if it feels uncomfortable?

Patient: If I let myself be vulnerable, the worst-case I imagine is an uncontained emotional cascade—crying at work, being unable to focus on code, my competence-feeling imploding, and people pulling away because they don't know how to handle it. There's this narrative that I'll be seen as weak or unprofessional, or that I'll lose the identity scaffold I've been clinging to, and that prospect feels genuinely terrifying. I can hear the rational part of me labeling that as catastrophizing, but another part is genuinely terrified of the uncertainty and of not being able to 'fix' it quickly. I'm parsing this instead of just saying "I'm scared," which is probably my avoidance—do those catastrophes sound realistic to you, or am I protecting myself with a melodramatic inner script?

Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that your inner script is quite dramatic, but you're also scared. Can you imagine if instead of catastrophizing, you simply acknowledged your fear with yourself, without judgment, and said, "I'm scared, and that's okay"? What would it be like to have a conversation with that scared part of yourself, and what might come up in that conversation?

Patient: I can picture that conversation fairly clearly: the scared part would rattle off worst-case narratives—“you’ll be seen as incompetent, you’ll lose people, you’ll feel hollow”—and my immediate reflex is to counter with metacognitive distancing, statistics, and solution schemas. Underneath that rhetoric the scared voice is much smaller and simpler: “I’m lonely, I don’t know who I am without this job,” and imagining that actually spoken aloud gives me a tight chest and this weird queasy heat, which is why I default to analysis. I can imagine trying to reply with something like, “I hear you, you’re scared and that’s OK,” but even rehearsing that feels exposed and performative. I don’t really know how to stay with that feeling without pivoting to problem-solving—how would I practice holding the scared part without immediately trying to fix it?

Therapist: Let's try an experiment: when you're in that conversation with your scared part, instead of trying to fix it or move on, can you simply observe it with kindness and curiosity, like you would a stranger's fear? Notice the sensation of your chest, the queasiness, without judgment – just witness it, as if you're watching a scene unfold. Would you be willing to just be with that feeling, without trying to change it, for just 30 seconds, 1 minute, or 5 minutes?

Patient: Okay—I'll try for one minute. Even saying that makes my chest tighten and my brain immediately wants to inventory feelings; I'm already picturing a checklist. If you count me down or give a prompt, I'll try to notice the tightness, the queasy heat, and the thoughts without trying to fix them.

Therapist: Let's bring in a small mindfulness exercise to help you anchor in the present moment. Can you bring your attention to your breath, feeling the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? Just observe the sensation of each breath, without judgment, and see if that brings you a sense of calm or grounding.

Patient: Okay — I tried that. At first my chest was tight and my breaths were shallow, like my body was bracing; after a few inhales it loosened a touch and my exhales felt a little longer. My mind immediately started cataloguing sensations and turning them into a checklist, and images of code reviews and the breakup kept flickering in, which made me anxious about getting “it” right. Noticing the breath without doing anything felt oddly vulnerable but also a tiny bit stabilizing — can we do another minute with a little guidance? I'm worried I'll just slip back into analysis.

Therapist: Let's add a physical anchor to help you stay grounded. I'd like you to place one hand on your heart and the other on your belly. Bring your attention to the sensation of your hand on your heart, feeling the weight of your hand, the sensation of your fingers, and the movement of your chest. Then, bring your attention to the sensation of your hand on your belly, feeling the weight of your hand, the sensation of your fingers, and the movement of your abdomen. Just notice the sensations, without trying to change them, and see if that helps you stay present and disengage from thoughts.

Patient: My right hand on my chest felt warm and a little heavy, and my left on my belly moved a bit with each breath — that tiny movement was oddly reassuring. At the same time my brain immediately started labeling everything (weight, temperature, amplitude) instead of just feeling it, so there’s a mix of a little grounding and an urge to evaluate whether I’m doing it “right.” I did notice the tightness ease a touch and the exhales lengthen, which felt good, but I'm worried I'll slide back into analysis—can we do another minute with you guiding me?

Therapist: Let's try to soften the invitation to notice your experience. Instead of trying to get everything just right, let's say "Okay, it's okay if I don't have a perfectly stable or calm feeling. It's okay if I'm still thinking, if I'm still feeling anxious, if I'm still getting distracted. Can I just be with whatever is here, in this moment, without judgment, just as it is?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Saying "it's okay if I'm still thinking" just sounds like another rule to follow, and my brain immediately tries to turn it into a checklist of whether I'm doing acceptance correctly. I can try to "be with whatever's here," but already I notice the chest tightness and that queasy heat and the narration—I'm annoyed that I'm narrating instead of feeling. Can you give a concrete example of what staying with it looks like when it isn't just another cognitive maneuver?

Therapist: Let's try a simple exercise. As you continue to breathe, I'd like you to bring your attention to your left hand on your belly. Notice the sensation of your hand on your belly, the movement of your abdomen, the sensation of your fingers on the blanket or chair, just as it is, without trying to change it. Don't try to make it perfect, don't try to relax it, just notice it exactly as it is. Can you stay with the sensation of your left hand on your belly, without judgment, for just 30 seconds?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to do the 30 seconds, though I'm not sure I follow how this is any different from the last prompt; it still feels like a procedural thing my brain can critique. Right now my left hand feels warm and a little heavy on my belly, I notice the tiny rise and fall, and underneath that there's the same chest tightness and this queasy heat; my mind keeps doing play-by-play labeling and wondering if I'm "doing it right." Could you count me down or set a simple timer, and then I'll report what actually registers for me after?

Therapist: I'm not going to give you a countdown or a timer. Instead, I'd like you to just notice the sensations, exactly as they are, without trying to change them or evaluate them. I'll pause for a moment, and then I'll make a simple comment that might throw you off the track. Then, I want you to just notice what comes up for you, without trying to think about it or analyze it. Ready? Here it goes: "Your eyes are blue."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "Your eyes are blue" supposed to help? That comment kind of pulls the rug out from under my checklist and makes me self-conscious, which immediately triggers analysis-thinking: Is this an observation, a test, or just a random anchor?

If I try to notice without doing that, what shows up physically is the same chest tightness and queasy heat, my left hand warm on my belly, and a little flutter in my throat. Emotionally it's weirdly off-putting and also a tiny bit flattered, which I then distrust and turn into a theory about why I feel that. I tried to stay with it, but my brain kept narrating—can we try another prompt and I'll keep focusing on the sensations without spinning into explanations?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. I'd like you to bring to your attention the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Just notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body, without trying to think about it, analyze it, or explain it. Don't try to do anything with it, just simply observe it. Can you focus on the sensation of your nostrils without getting caught up in thoughts or explanations?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my nostrils meaningfully different from the other anchors, but I'll try. I noticed a cool, slightly ticklish inhale and a warmer exhale, a faint pressure at the top of my nasal passages, and underneath that the same chest tightness and queasy heat; my mind still kept translating sensations into labels, which feels like emotional avoidance. Can we do a short guided version where you prompt me every 15–20 seconds so I don't just slip into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try a guided exercise. I'll prompt you every 15-20 seconds. Here's your first prompt: "Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground." Just notice it, without thinking about it, without trying to explain it.

Patient: Okay—my feet feel solid on the floor; I notice pressure under my heels and the balls of my feet, a faint coolness by my toes. At the same time my brain is already racing—listing things I should've done this morning, rehearsing potential code-review critiques—so there's this jittery buzz and a tighter chest that keeps pulling me out of the sensation. I can try to stay with it if you prompt me again in 15–20 seconds.

Therapist: Here's your next prompt: "I'm going to pause for 5 seconds before I prompt you again. During that time, can you simply stay with the sensations in your feet, without thinking about them, without trying to analyze them, without doing anything with them? Just be with what's happening right now."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how a five-second pause is meaningfully different, but I'll try. In that short silence I could feel the pressure under my heels and a coolness by my toes, but my chest tightened and my thoughts sprinted—lists, missed tasks, a knot of dread—so it was hard to stay with just the feet. I can keep doing this if you prompt me every 15–20 seconds; I need that scaffolding because my brain keeps hijacking the moment.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of a pause, I'll give you a clear signal to help you transition back to the sensations in your feet. When I say "Ground", I want you to gently bring your attention back to the sensations in your feet, without trying to think about them. When you're ready, you can come back to our conversation. Got it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is a single cue like "Ground" supposed to anchor me when my chest's already tight and my mind's sprinting? I can try it, but it might feel performative unless you repeat it or pair it with a very brief concrete instruction (like "feel the pressure under your heels now").

Therapist: Let's try a revised approach. When I say "Notice", I want you to gently bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, without trying to think about them, without trying to analyze them. Try to simply notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, without adding anything to it. Let's start again, and I'll give you the cue "Notice".

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, but I'm not sure I follow how the single cue helps; my chest's tight and my mind's already sprinting through a backlog of tasks. Say "Notice" and I'll try to bring attention to my feet, though I might need you to repeat it a couple times so I don't slip into analysis.

Therapist: "Notice". Take a deep breath and bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Just notice, without trying to think about them, without trying to analyze them, without doing anything with them. "Notice". Take another breath and bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet. "Notice".

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "Notice" supposed to help? It sounds good as a concept, but when you say it my chest tightens and my brain immediately flips to a to‑do list and anxious scenarios, so I can feel my feet and also be narrating why I'm not feeling them. I can try again, but I need you to repeat the cue more often and give a really concrete micro-instruction (like "Notice — breathe in for 4, out for 6") or I'll just keep narrating and analyzing instead of actually staying with it.

Therapist: "Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Breathe in for 4... and then out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Breathe in for 4... and then out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground." Repeat after me: "Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground."

Patient: "Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground."

Okay—I breathed in for 4 and out for 6 like you said; I can feel pressure under my heels and a coolness near my toes, but my chest tightened and my brain immediately sprinted into a backlog of code tasks and potential social faux pas. I'm not sure I follow how repeating that phrase is supposed to interrupt the meta-narration—it feels like telling a compiler to stop compiling itself. I can keep doing it if you cue me more often, or if you let me say the intrusive thoughts out loud as they come so they don't pile up under my ribs.

Therapist: I'd like you to speak your thoughts out loud, just as they come, without trying to evaluate or analyze them. You can say them to me, and I'll simply listen without judgment. If you need to, you can say "interrupted" or "held up" when you feel yourself getting caught up in thoughts, and we can start again. Let's try this: what's the first thought that comes up for you, and can you express it out loud?

Patient: "Did I just miss that PR comment?" — and then it escalates into, "If they flag it I'll look incompetent, which feeds into this broader narrative of being reduced to my job, which then links back to the breakup and my whole identity collapsing," and now I'm already spinning a theory instead of sitting with the tightness in my chest. Interrupted.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to express yourself. It sounds like you're having a lot on your mind, and that's okay. Can you take a deep breath with me and focus on the physical sensation of your feet on the ground? Just notice the pressure under your heels and the coolness near your toes, without thinking about anything else. Let's start again.

Patient: I'm not sure I fully follow how focusing on my feet fixes anything, but I did it—took a deep breath and felt the pressure under my heels and a coolness by my toes, and my chest is still tight. As soon as I try to stay with that, my mind shoots off to the PR comment and this whole narrative about competence and the breakup, so I end up narrating instead of actually feeling it. Interrupted — can we try it again with you cueing every 10 seconds? I need the scaffolding or I just keep spiraling into analysis.

Therapist: Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground.

Patient: Okay — I did the 4/6 breaths with your "Notice" prompts. I could feel the pressure under my heels and a coolness by my toes, and the exhales lengthened a bit so my chest loosened marginally, but the queasy heat stayed and my mind kept generating meta‑narratives about the PR and my identity collapsing. I'm frustrated and a little embarrassed that I can't just "be" with this; I keep converting sensations into theories. Can you keep cueing me every ~10 seconds and tell me to say "held" when I get stuck, because I really need that micro‑scaffolding or I just drift back into analysis.

Therapist: Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Say "held". Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Say "held". Notice - breathe in for 4, out for 6. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Say "held".

Patient: Held. Held. Held.

I did the 4/6 breaths with your prompts — pressure under my heels, coolness by my toes, exhales a bit longer, chest marginally looser — but the queasy heat stuck around and my mind kept spinning PR/competence/breakup narratives. Saying "held" helps a tiny bit to notice the hijack, but I'm still defaulting to analysis; can you keep cueing at that pace and maybe shorten the intervals, or give a very concrete next micro-prompt so I don't just narrate myself into oblivion?

Therapist: Notice - breathe in for 2, out for 3. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Notice - breathe in for 2, out for 3. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Say "held". Notice - breathe in for 2, out for 3. Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. Say "held".

Patient: Held. Held.

I did the 2/3 breaths and noticed the cool inhale at my nostrils and the pressure under my heels, but my chest tightened and a jittery cascade of task-thoughts ramped up—it's like the breathing grounds me a bit but also makes the anxious noise louder. I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to interrupt the narrative loop; saying "held" helps me notice the hijack but doesn't stop the analysis, so can you keep cueing me every 8–10 seconds or give a very specific micro-instruction I can follow?

Therapist: Notice - touch your left hand to your left thigh. Notice the sensation of your hand touching your thigh. Notice - touch your left hand to your left thigh. Notice the sensation of your hand touching your thigh. Say "held". Notice - notice the sensation of your left hand touching your thigh. Say "held".

Patient: Held.

My left hand feels warm and a little heavy on my thigh, I notice the fabric texture and a tiny micro-movement with each breath. At the same time my chest tightens and the queasy heat is still there, and my mind immediately slips into meta-mode—cataloguing temperature, theorizing about interoceptive avoidance—instead of just being with it. I'm not sure I follow how this is meaningfully different from the other anchors; can you keep cueing every ~8 seconds or give a very concrete next micro-prompt so I don't just narrate myself into analysis?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of your feet on the floor. Notice the weight and pressure of your body on the floor. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. Say "held". Notice the sensation of your hands on the floor. Notice the sensation of your hands touching the floor. Say "held".

Patient: Held.

My feet feel heavy into the floor—pressure under the heels, a coolness near the toes; the air in my nostrils is cool on the inhale, warmer on the exhale; my hands on the floor register fabric texture and a slight micro‑movement with each breath. At the same time my chest is tighter and there's this queasy heat and my mind is sprinting—PRs, deadlines, that old competence narrative—so I'm more jittery and distracted than before. Saying "held" flags the hijack but doesn't stop the meta‑narration; can you keep cueing every ~8 seconds or give one very concrete micro‑task I can follow so I don't just turn this into another analysis?

Therapist: Slowly lift your left hand off the floor. Notice the sensation of your hand leaving the floor. Hold your hand suspended in mid-air for a count of 4. Notice the sensation of your hand in mid-air. Slowly lower your hand back down to the floor. Notice the sensation of your hand touching the floor again. Say "held".

Patient: I did it — slowly lifted my left hand and felt a subtle lightness, a little muscle tension in the wrist, and a faint tingling where my fingers left the fabric; holding it suspended felt oddly exposing, like a small test. Lowering it back down, I felt the contact return and the same chest tightness and queasy heat undercutting everything, while my mind kept riffing on PRs and deadlines. Held. Can we keep going with another very concrete micro-prompt? I need the scaffolding every few seconds or I just slip into analysis.
