Patient: I'm an older student dealing with burnout after a recent health scare, and it's been on my mind nonstop. Whenever I get angry or frustrated — especially about doctors or test results — my brain flips into this fortune-telling mode that insists the worst will happen: I'll get sicker, fail my studies, lose my independence, and everything will spiral, like it's already decided. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't seem to take other outcomes seriously, and it makes me snap at people and feel trapped.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it's like when your brain starts flipping into this fortune-telling mode? What sensations or emotions do you notice, and what happens in your body when you start predicting all these worst-case scenarios?

Patient: It starts in my chest — a tight, icy pressure — and my jaw and hands clench before I even know why; my heart kicks up, I feel hot and shaky, and everything narrows. Emotionally it's this ugly mix of anger and dread, like I'm furious at the world for what I just "know" is going to happen and terrified at the same time. My mind instantly strings together a chain of disasters — one test goes wrong, then classes collapse, then I lose my independence — and I can't stop replaying that movie until I snap at whoever's there. Afterward I'm embarrassed and wiped out, but the stories pull me right back, so when someone says maybe it won't happen, I just think they're not seeing the truth.

Therapist: It sounds like having a sense of control and being able to predict what's going to happen is extremely important to you right now. Can you think of a time when having control or certainty would truly feel empowering to you, even if it meant tolerating some uncertainty?

Patient: Yeah — if a doctor could just say flat-out, "Your tests are fine and here's a guaranteed plan that keeps you independent," I think I'd stop spiraling long enough to breathe. Right now any hint of ambiguity makes my brain build the worst possible chain — and honestly, tolerating uncertainty feels like pretending the catastrophe won't come when it's already in motion. I get furious when people suggest "it might be okay"; to me that sounds naive, not helpful.

Therapist: I can see why a clear message from the doctor would be reassuring, but what if I told you that you could find some calm in the midst of uncertainty? What would happen if, instead of expecting a guarantee, you were to approach life with a sense of curiosity and openness, even when faced with ambiguity?

Patient: Curiosity sounds like pretending nothing's wrong, and I can't do that. If I try to be open my brain screams that I'm lying to myself — one missed sign turns into a missed diagnosis, then hospitalization, then I fall behind in classes and lose my apartment and independence; that's the chain that will definitely happen. I get furious when people say "be curious" because to me it feels like they're giving me optimism instead of a plan, and I just can't take other outcomes seriously.

Therapist: Can you imagine you're walking through a familiar place, like your campus, and you notice a small, insignificant detail that catches your attention, like a leaf on the ground or a song playing in the distance? What would it be like if, instead of immediately jumping to worst-case scenarios, you allowed yourself to observe that detail without judgment or interpretation?

Patient: I can't just look at a leaf — my brain immediately strings a whole catastrophe: I slip on it, break a hip, wind up in the hospital, miss exams, and suddenly I'm dependent and ruined. When that movie starts my chest tightens, my hands clench, and I get hot and furious at anyone who says it's nothing — it feels like they're denying the obvious. Trying to "observe" calmly just feels like lying to myself, and that makes me angry and even more stuck.

Therapist: Can you imagine you're with a friend who's experiencing a similar emotional response to your catastrophizing? What would you say to your friend to help them feel more grounded and present in the moment, and would that same approach work for you with your own thoughts when they start spiraling?

Patient: I'd probably tell a friend to slow down, breathe, and list the facts — like, what's actually happened versus the story their mind is telling — to pull them out of the runaway worst-case movie. But if I tried that myself it wouldn't work; my head just keeps insisting the disaster chain is real and I get angry that people hand me "maybe" answers like they're hiding the truth. It feels hypocritical and infuriating, and I can't see how calm advice would quiet the predictions.

Therapist: Let's try something simple: when you feel the thoughts of a worst-case scenario arising, I'd like you to say to yourself, "I will observe this thought, and that's it." Can you practice saying that sentence out loud with me, and then pause for a moment, without trying to analyze or change the thought?

Patient: "I will observe this thought, and that's it." I said it out loud. 

But as soon as I tried to pause my chest tightened, my jaw clenched, and the movie started: a bad test, a hospital stay, failing classes, losing my independence — like it's already set. I tried to just notice it, but it felt like lying to myself and that made me angry and shaking. Can we try it again? I don't think it'll work, but I'm willing to try.

Therapist: Can you try a tiny, tiny adjustment to the phrase: "I will notice this thought, and that's it." Instead of saying "will observe," what if you said "noticing" instead? Sometimes, a slight shift in wording can help us feel more comfortable with the action.

Patient: Okay — "I'm noticing this thought, and that's it." 

I said it, but my chest tightened and the worst-case movie kicked in right away: a bad test, hospital bed, failing classes, losing my independence — like it's already happening, and that makes me furious at whoever tells me to "notice" it like it's nothing. Can we try it again? I don't think it'll help, but I'm willing to keep going.

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensations in your body when you try to notice the thought. Can you bring your attention to your breath, and notice how your body feels when you say "I'm noticing this thought, and that's it"? Are there any other physical sensations, like tension, numbness, or relaxation?

Patient: When I try to breathe into it, my breaths get short and shallow, like I'm holding myself up, and my chest feels like a tight band — my jaw and fingers clench and my stomach goes cold. Saying "I'm noticing this thought" actually seems to turn the movie up louder: I get hot, my hands tremble, and the worst-case chain starts running like it's already happened. That makes me prickly and furious, not calmer — I don't relax, I just feel more wound up and exhausted. I don't know if that helps you, but I'm willing to keep trying — what should we do next?

Therapist: Can you imagine that your body is like a small, calm lake, and your thoughts are like ripples on its surface? What if, instead of trying to control the ripples or the thought, you simply allow the lake to be what it is – calm, or calm-ish – even if the ripples are present?

Patient: I can't picture a calm lake without my brain turning the tiniest ripple into a tsunami — a leaf falls, ripples, becomes a storm, the dam breaks, I'm in a hospital bed, behind in classes, losing my independence. The image feels like a lie that lets the disaster sneak up, and that makes me angry and tense, not soothed. I can try to force the lake picture, but I don't expect it to quiet the movie — what exactly should I do while I'm trying it?

Therapist: Can you try simply noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Notice this sensation without trying to change it or interpret it. Just be with it, as it is.

Patient: I tried — my feet felt heavy and a little cold on the floor, the air on my face was faintly cool, and my breath was shallow and quick, but as soon as I tried to stay with those sensations the chest tightness and jaw clench kicked in. The movie started anyway: one small stumble, a broken hip, hospital, missed exams, losing my independence — like it's already unfolding — and that makes me hot and furious at the idea that "noticing" could help. I feel ridiculous and embarrassed, but I'm hooked on the story and can't let it go. Can we slow down? I don't know what else to do right now, but I'm willing to keep trying if you guide me through it more slowly.

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step back. Can you take one deep breath in, and then let it out slowly, without trying to control it or change it in any way? Just allow the breath to be what it is. Then, can you bring your attention to one small aspect of your body, like your left hand or your left foot, and simply notice its presence without trying to do anything with it? No thinking, no interpreting, just noticing.

Patient: I took a deep breath out, but it felt short and thin and my chest stayed tight — like I was holding everything up. When I turned my attention to my left hand it felt heavy and a little numb, but the moment I tried to stay with that sensation the worst-case movie started up again — a fall, a hospital, failing everything — and I got hot and furious at the idea that "noticing" could fix it. Can we slow down? I don't know that this will help, but I'm willing to try if you guide me more slowly.

Therapist: Let's take another tiny step back. Can you simply observe yourself sitting in this moment, without trying to change or interpret anything? Just notice the sensation of your seat on the chair, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sound of your own breathing. No goal, no expectation, no trying to achieve anything. Just being with what is, as it is.

Patient: I can feel the chair under me and the air on my skin for a beat, but my breath stays shallow and the movie kicks in right away — I slip, break a hip, end up in hospital, fail my courses, lose my apartment and independence like it's already certain. That flips me into hot, furious shame, like whoever tells me to "just notice" is mocking the truth. Can we slow down? Tell me exactly what to do next — I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling.

Therapist: I want you to know that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to acknowledge and be proud of. Now, I'd like you to do something small, just for this moment. Can you gently put one finger on your chest, where the tightness is, and say to yourself, "I am here, and I am experiencing this." Just say it, without trying to change it or interpret it. No judgment, no expectations.

Patient: Okay — I put a finger on my chest and said, "I am here, and I am experiencing this." It felt heavy and tight, my breath stayed shallow, and as soon as I said it the worst-case movie revved up — hospital, failing classes, losing my independence — which made me hot and furious. I don't know how to stay with this without spiraling; can we slow down and do the next step very slowly?

Therapist: I want you to take another small step back. Can you look down at your finger on your chest, and simply notice its position, its weight, its sensation of being there? Don't try to think about it or analyze it. Just look at it, without judgment or expectation. Just be with the sensation of your finger on your chest.

Patient: I looked down — my finger felt cool and a bit heavy, like it didn't want to be there, and it trembled a little. The instant I tried to stay with that feeling the worst-case movie surged — a fall, hospital, failing my classes, losing my independence — and I got hot, furious, and my chest tightened worse. Can we slow down? Tell me exactly what to do next, step by step, because staying with this already feels like it's slipping away.

Therapist: I want you to take another tiny step back. Can you take a tiny breath in, just one more breath, and as you exhale, bring your attention back to your finger on your chest? Don't try to notice it, just gently acknowledge its presence. As you exhale, say to yourself, "My finger is there." No judgment, no thinking, just a simple statement of fact.

Patient: I took the tiny breath and, as I exhaled, said, "My finger is there." It landed hollow — my chest tightened, my jaw clenched, and the worst-case movie jumped right back in: a stumble, a hospital bed, failed exams, losing my independence — like it's already happening, and that makes me hot and furious. I need us to slow way down; tell me exactly what to do next, step by step, because right now staying with this just feels like it's slipping away and I'm hooked on the story.

Therapist: I want you to take another tiny step back. Can you notice the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth? Just notice its position, its weight, its sensation of being there. Don't try to think about it, don't try to change it, just notice it as it is. As you notice your tongue, say to yourself, "My tongue is touching the roof of my mouth."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? 

I tried it: my tongue feels dull and pressed to the roof of my mouth, a little dry, but the moment I said "My tongue is touching the roof of my mouth" the worst-case movie blasted back in — I stumble, break something, I'm in a hospital bed, I fail exams, I lose my independence — like it's already done. 

That just makes me hot and furious, like noticing is a trick that makes the story louder. Can we slow way down? Tell me exactly what to do next, step by step.

Therapist: I want you to focus on your breath. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it? Just notice the sensation of the breath as it is. Don't think about it, don't try to analyze it, just notice it. As you notice the breath, allow yourself to be present with it, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on my breath supposed to help? I tried it: the breath's shallow and quick, my chest stays tight, my jaw clenches, and the moment I notice it the worst-case movie floods in — I stumble, end up in a hospital bed, fail my courses, lose my independence — like it's already decided. That just makes me hot, furious, and embarrassed, not calmer. Can we slow way down? Tell me exactly what to do next, step by step, because I want to try but I keep getting pulled into the story.

Therapist: I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the weight of your feet, the sensation of the floor beneath them, the feeling of your feet being in contact with the earth? Don't try to think about it, don't try to analyze it, just notice the physical sensation of your feet touching the ground.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on my feet supposed to help? 

I tried it: my feet feel heavy and a little numb on the floor, but the moment I try to notice that the movie kicks in — I slip, break a hip, wind up in a hospital bed, fail my exams, and lose my independence like it's already decided. 

That makes me hot, furious, and ashamed, like whoever tells me to "feel my feet" is trying to distract me from the obvious. Can we slow down? Tell me exactly what to do next, step by step, because right now staying with this just pulls me deeper into the story.

Therapist: I want you to look at me. Just look at me, without trying to think about me, without trying to analyze me, without judging me. Just look at my face, my eyes, my expression.

Patient: I'm not sure I can just look at you — it feels... loaded, like your face will confirm the disaster I'm already seeing. The moment I meet someone's eyes my chest tightens and my head starts narrating: the doctor looks worried, the tests are bad, I'm in a hospital bed, I fail my classes, I lose my independence — and then I get hot and furious at whoever dares to tell me "it might be okay." 

Can we slow down? Tell me exactly what you want me to do with my eyes, step by step, because I'm afraid if I try on my own the movie will take over.

Therapist: I want you to look at the back of my head, where the nape of my neck meets my shoulders. Can you look at the back of my head, without looking at my face or any other part of me? Just look at the back of my head, and hold that look for just one second, without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without judging it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is looking at the back of your head supposed to help? Just thinking about doing that makes my chest tighten, my jaw and hands clench, and the fortune-telling movie starts: the doctor looks away, the tests are bad, I'm in a hospital bed, I fail my classes, I lose my independence. That whole chain makes me hot and furious like you're pretending it's nothing—can we slow down? Tell me exactly what to do, step by step, because if I try on my own the story will take over.

Therapist: I want you to gently take a small, tiny step forward, just one tiny step, with your feet. Can you take that tiny step, without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without judging it? Just take one tiny step forward, and hold that step for just a moment.

Patient: Okay — I can try. I took a tiny step forward, just an inch or so, but my chest immediately tightened and my brain started the movie: I stumble, break a hip, end up in a hospital bed, fail my classes, lose my independence like it's already decided. I get hot and furious that this is supposed to be simple — I'm not sure I follow how a tiny step helps. Can we slow down? Tell me exactly how small you want it and what to do if the panic spikes.

Therapist: I want you to simply relax your jaw. Can you allow your jaw to drop slightly, just a tiny bit, without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without judging it? Just relax your jaw, and hold that relaxation for just a moment. If your panic spikes, I want you to pause and simply acknowledge it as a physical sensation. Say to yourself, "My jaw is relaxed."

Patient: I tried to let my jaw drop a little — it felt strange and loose, but the moment I did my chest clenched and the worst-case movie kicked in full blast: bad test, hospital bed, failed classes, losing my independence. I said, "My jaw is relaxed," like you suggested, but it sounded hollow and made me hotter and angrier, not calmer. I'm not sure I follow—how is loosening my jaw supposed to stop that chain? Can we slow way down and you tell me, step by step, what to do if the panic spikes?

Therapist: I want you to pause for a very brief moment, just 1-2 seconds, after you say "My jaw is relaxed." Can you pause, and just be with the phrase, without thinking about it, without analyzing it, without judging it? Don't try to control the pause or change it, just allow it to be what it is.

If your panic spikes during this pause, I want you to acknowledge it as a physical sensation, and then say to yourself, "I am here, and I am experiencing this." Don't try to change the thought, don't try to control it, just acknowledge it as a physical sensation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried to pause after saying "My jaw is relaxed," but the second I held it my chest squeezed, my hands trembled, and the movie blasted back in: bad tests, hospital, failed classes, losing my independence. I said, "I am here, and I am experiencing this," like you asked, but it sounded hollow and just made me hotter and angrier, and I couldn't keep the pause. Can we slow way down? Tell me exactly, step by step, what to do when the panic spikes, because right now the story takes over every time.

Therapist: I want you to gently acknowledge the feeling of panic, without trying to change it or analyze it. When your panic spikes, can you simply acknowledge it as a physical sensation, without judgment or expectation? Say to yourself, "My body is experiencing this feeling of panic." Don't try to control it, don't try to change it, just acknowledge it as a physical sensation.

Next, I want you to bring your attention to your breath, and say to yourself, "I am breathing." Don't try to focus on the breath, don't try to control it, just acknowledge its presence. Allow yourself to be present with the breath, without judgment or expectation.

If your panic spikes again, we'll take it one small step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I'll try.

"My body is experiencing this feeling of panic." "I am breathing." Saying that out loud did something small — my chest is a tight band, breaths are shallow, my hands tremble and I feel hot and furious — and the worst-case movie immediately starts: hospital, failed exams, losing my independence, like it's already decided.

I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and do the next step very slowly, step by step, and tell me exactly what to do when the panic spikes, because right now the story takes over and I can't think straight.

Therapist: I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without trying to think about it, without analyzing it, without judging it? Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor.

When your panic spikes, I want you to say to yourself, "I am noticing my feet touching the floor." Don't try to control the panic, don't try to change it, just acknowledge it as a physical sensation. Allow yourself to be present with the sensation of your feet touching the floor, without judgment or expectation.

If your panic spikes again, we'll take it one small step at a time. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to your feet touching the floor again. Say to yourself, "I am noticing my feet touching the floor."

Patient: Okay — I took a deep breath in and exhaled, and as I did I tried to bring attention to my feet and said, "I am noticing my feet touching the floor." It felt hollow — my chest tightened into that same band, my breath stayed shallow, my hands trembled, and the movie kicked in: I slip, break something, wind up in a hospital bed, fail my exams, lose my independence — like it's already happened. 

I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow way down and you tell me exactly what to do next, step by step, and what to do the moment the panic spikes?
