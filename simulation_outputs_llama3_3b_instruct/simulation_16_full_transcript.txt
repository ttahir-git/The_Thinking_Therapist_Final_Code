--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling stuck — my life seems to only matter when I'm at work as a nurse, and since my partner died I don't know who I am beyond that. My confidence is low and I get anxious about even thinking what else should matter to me. I don't expect this will fix anything, so how is talking about it supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses a deep sense of identity tied to their work as a nurse, feeling lost without their partner, and struggles with low confidence and anxiety about exploring alternative sources of meaning. Core emotion is a sense of uncertainty and confusion. Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of 'stuck' and its relationship to identity to identify potential areas for committed action.

Therapist Answer:
That sounds like a really tough place to be. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "my life only matters when I'm at work"? What is it about being a nurse that gives your life meaning, and what happens when you're not in that role?

Patient: Being a nurse gives me a schedule and a sense that I'm needed — I know what to do and I can be useful, which makes the day matter. When I'm not working it's mostly quiet, things around the house remind me of him, and I feel like I don't have a purpose or interests that stick. I've tried picking up activities and even volunteering, but it doesn't last — so honestly, how is talking about this supposed to help if I can't seem to make anything change?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's sense of identity is deeply tied to their work, providing structure and a sense of purpose. Their grief and loss are causing a sense of emptiness and uncertainty about their identity outside of work. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, focusing on small, low-stakes actions to create space for new experiences.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck between the security of your work and the emptiness of your personal life. I want to gently suggest that maybe the problem isn't that you can't make change, but rather that you're not giving yourself permission to explore what else might be meaningful to you. What if, instead of trying to find a new hobby or activity, you started small, like taking a 5-minute walk outside each day, or chatting with a friend for 10 minutes? Would that be a tiny, low-risk step to create some space for new possibilities to emerge?

Patient: I get what you're saying about tiny steps, but honestly that sounds almost trivial — how is a 5‑minute walk supposed to change years of feeling empty? I've done little things before and they peter out; I end up back at the house with everything reminding me of him. I could try it, but I'm not sure what would be different or how that would stop the whole weight of it from coming back.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to see the value in small, incremental changes, feeling like they need a more substantial solution to address years of emotional pain. Core emotion is frustration and desperation. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) to explore the thought patterns and emotions driving their skepticism.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why a 5-minute walk might seem like a small thing. The truth is, it's not about fixing everything at once, but about creating a tiny crack in the dam. What if, instead of trying to "stop" the weight of your grief, you started to acknowledge it as a part of you? Can you think of a sentence that describes your relationship with grief right now? For example, "Grief is a heavy, constant presence in my life" or "I feel overwhelmed by the memories of him"? Sometimes, by naming and accepting our emotions, we can start to create some space from them.

Patient: Grief feels like a dull, constant ache that fills the quiet and makes everything else fade—like I'm only the nurse and nothing else matters. I don't see how naming it will change that; I've talked about it before and it didn't do much. How is that supposed to help now?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to see the value in naming their grief, feeling like it's a fixed, all-consuming presence. Core emotion is resistance to change. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that naming grief hasn't provided a clear solution in the past. Can I ask, what's the difference between naming your grief now versus talking about it for the first time? Is it just that you're already comfortable with the idea of talking about it, or is there something specific that's making you hesitant to explore it further?

Patient: I guess naming it now doesn't feel any different—I've named it a hundred times. How is that supposed to help? I'm hesitant because talking feels like re‑opening the wound without fixing anything, and as a nurse I'm used to doing things that produce results, not just words. I'm willing to try, though I'm doubtful—so how would you do it differently so it actually makes a difference?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is skeptical about the value of talking, feeling like it's just words without action, and is used to taking tangible actions as a nurse. Core emotion is still resistance to change. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, focusing on a more experiential approach.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your hesitation. Let's try something different. Instead of just talking about your grief, what if we do a simple exercise together? We can take a few deep breaths, and I'll guide you through a brief mindfulness exercise that might help you connect with your body and emotions in a more embodied way. No talking, just presence. Would you be willing to try that with me?

Patient: Alright... I'll try it, even though I'm skeptical — how is breathing supposed to change years of this? I've taught patients breathing exercises before and it didn't fix the rest of their lives, but I'll do a few breaths with you and I'll tell you if it just makes the ache worse.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still skeptical about the value of the exercise, but willing to give it a try. Core emotion is still some level of frustration and skepticism. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and explore the relationship between physical sensations and emotional pain.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to try. As we breathe, notice where you feel the ache in your body, and I want you to do that without trying to change it or push it away. Just observe it, like you would observe a patient's pain. Can you bring your attention to that sensation right now, and see if you can find any words to describe it, like "it's a heaviness in my chest" or "a tightness in my shoulders"?

Patient: I notice a dull, heavy ache right in the center of my chest, like there's a weight pressing down; my throat tightens and my shoulders tense up with it. Taking a few breaths loosens it for a few seconds, then it settles back in. I can point it out, but how is knowing where it is supposed to help me actually find anything that matters beyond work?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has begun to notice their physical sensations and can describe them, which is a small step towards defusion. Core emotion is still a desire for concrete solutions. Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
That's really great that you can point out where the ache is and notice how it changes with your breath. Now, I want to ask, what is it about being a nurse that feels most meaningful to you? What is it about the work that gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment? Can you think of a specific moment or experience that stands out to you, even just for a brief moment, where you felt like you were making a real difference?

Patient: I think it's the being-needed part — knowing someone depends on me and that I can stay calm and do the right thing when everything else is chaotic. Once I stayed late with an older woman, Mrs. Alvarez, as she died; I held her hand and talked about her garden until her son came, and when he squeezed my hand and thanked me I actually felt like I mattered. But those moments vanish the second I leave the ward, and honestly — how is talking about them supposed to help me feel that way outside of work?

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a specific aspect of their work that brings them a sense of purpose and fulfillment, being needed by others. Core emotion is still a desire for a sense of connection and meaning outside of work. Goal: Connect this sense of purpose to a broader value.

Therapist Answer:
Those moments with Mrs. Alvarez sound incredibly meaningful to you, and it's beautiful that you're willing to hold onto those feelings. I want to ask, is there a value that you're trying to live up to, a value that says "I'm worthy of being needed, of being loved and cared for" outside of your work? For example, is it the value of being a good person, being a caring friend, or something else?

Patient: I guess the value is being useful and compassionate — being someone others can rely on, the sort of person who stays calm and does the right thing. But at home there's nobody counting on me and I don't have any proof I'm that person anymore, so I feel worthless and it's hard to hold onto it. I'm feeling jittery and distracted right now — how is naming that value supposed to help me actually live it outside of work?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has identified a value that is closely tied to their work, but is struggling to apply it outside of that context. Core emotion is still feeling worthless and uncertain. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, focusing on small, concrete steps to apply the value in everyday life.

Therapist Answer:
Those feelings of worthlessness and uncertainty are really tough to deal with. I want to ask, what if, instead of trying to live up to that value in big ways, we focus on small, everyday actions that show up in your daily life? For example, how would you take care of yourself today, if you didn't have to think about work? What simple things could you do to show up as the compassionate and useful person you value being?

Patient: I guess small things might be calling an old friend for ten minutes, making myself a proper meal and actually sitting to eat it, watering the plants and tending the little things around the house, or writing a short note to someone who mattered to him. I'm feeling jittery and distracted right now — my hands are a bit shaky — so I don't know how reliable I'd be at actually doing them. But honestly, how is those little things supposed to make me feel like I matter when everything that matters disappears once I walk out of the ward? I've tried bits like that before and they don't stick.

Therapist Thinking:
The patient has begun to think of small, everyday actions that can help them show up as the compassionate and useful person they value being. Core emotion is still feeling uncertain about the reliability of these actions. Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and explore the relationship between self-doubt and the value of action.

Therapist Answer:
I can see why you're worried about being able to stick to these small actions. But what if, instead of focusing on whether you can do them perfectly or not, we looked at it as a way to practice being reliable and compassionate, not for anyone else's benefit, but for yours? What if, instead of trying to do these things to prove your worth, you did them because they bring you a sense of comfort and peace?

Patient: I appreciate the idea, but I'm not convinced—how is doing little things for myself supposed to change that when I'm jittery and distracted; my hands shake and my mind keeps slipping back to him? Practicing being reliable for myself sounds nice on paper, but I've tried self-care and it doesn't make me feel like I matter outside work. If you really think this could help, tell me plainly: how would you help me actually follow through when I get like this?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to see the value in self-care and is skeptical about their ability to follow through on small actions. Core emotion is still uncertainty and frustration. Goal: Introduce experiential support as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
I want to tell you something plain: when I see you getting stuck, I'm here to support you in small ways. When you feel jittery and distracted, I'll be here to remind you of your breath, to help you come back to the present moment. I'll also offer you a specific, concrete action to take next, something that's easy to do, like taking a few more deep breaths or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground. My goal is not to tell you what to do or try to fix everything, but to create a gentle, supportive space for you to explore your own capacity for self-care and compassion. Would you be willing to try this with me?

Patient: Alright... I'll try, though I'm jittery and my hands are shaking. Give me one simple, concrete thing to do right now — not a list — something I can actually do in this moment. And be honest: how is that one thing supposed to help when the relief always vanishes as soon as I'm back home?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to take a small step, but still uncertain about the long-term impact. Core emotion is still a sense of desperation for lasting relief. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible action to create a brief sense of relief.

Therapist Answer:
Right now, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice the feeling of the chair beneath you, the sensation of your feet touching the floor. Just focus on that sensation, without trying to think about anything else. Can you do that for just 30 seconds, without moving or doing anything else?

Patient: Okay — I tried. I could feel the pads of my feet on the floor and the chair at my back; it grounded me for a few breaths, then my mind darted to him and my hands started shaking again. How is feeling my feet supposed to make this less heavy when it always comes back?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has taken a small step and experienced a brief sense of grounding, but their mind has already returned to their grief. Core emotion is still a sense of desperation for lasting relief. Goal: Create a sense of curiosity about the relationship between the physical sensation and the emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore this further. What happens when you feel the weight of your grief and your mind starts to wander to him? What's the first thing that pops into your mind, or what's the first thing you notice about your body when you feel that way?

Patient: The first thing that pops up is the empty chair at the kitchen table or his mug — and right away my chest feels like it's being pressed down, my throat tightens, and my shoulders bunch up. My hands get shaky, my breath gets shallow, and I get jittery and distracted so I can't hold on to anything else. I can tell you all that, but I don't see how just noticing it helps — what am I supposed to do with that when it just pulls me back under?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient has vividly described the automatic response to their grief, and is seeking a clear direction for action. Core emotion is still a sense of hopelessness. Goal: Introduce a small, experiential action to create a sense of control and agency.

Therapist Answer:
I want to ask, what if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts or feelings, you could learn to observe them with a sense of curiosity, like a scientist studying a natural phenomenon? Would you be willing to try that, not to change anything, but just to see what happens when you observe it with a curious, open mind?

Patient: I guess I can try, though I'm jittery—my hands are shaking and I can't focus. How am I supposed to "observe" a memory—just notice it and name it? I've tried watching my thoughts before and it felt like just sitting with the ache—how is that supposed to help? If you're going to ask me to try, give me one clear, concrete step I can do right now.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is willing to try observing their thoughts and emotions, but is struggling to focus due to physical symptoms. Core emotion is still a sense of frustration and desperation. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible action to create a sense of control and focus.

Therapist Answer:
I'm going to ask you to do something very simple, just to help you feel more grounded. Can you slowly and gently say the word "acknowledged" to yourself, in a soft voice, without trying to add anything else? Just say "acknowledged" - no elaboration, no interpretation, just the word.

Patient: Okay... I said it — "acknowledged" — softly. It loosened the tightness for a breath or two, but my hands are still shaking and my mind's already darted back to the chair at the kitchen table. How is saying one word supposed to get me past this when it always fades so fast?

The patient has taken a small step in observing their thoughts, but their mind is already returning to their grief. Core emotion is still a sense of hopelessness. Goal: Introduce a sense of interdependence and support.

Therapist Answer:
I want to acknowledge that it's not just you against your thoughts and emotions. Would you be willing to hold onto my presence with you, just for this moment, and say "I'm here" to yourself? Not trying to change anything, just a simple acknowledgement of my presence with you.

Patient: Okay... I'll try — "I'm here." It loosened the knot for a breath, but I'm still jittery and my hands are shaking and my mind's already back on the chair at the kitchen table. How is saying that supposed to make any of this stick when it always fades? Give me one clear, concrete thing I can do right now when it comes back — not a list.

The patient has begun to acknowledge their emotional state and the present moment, but is struggling to sustain the feeling. Core emotion is still a sense of desperation for lasting relief. Goal: Introduce a small, tangible action to create a sense of momentum.

Therapist Answer:
When your mind starts to wander back to the chair at the kitchen table, I want you to pause and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, counting to four on your exhale. Can you do that for me right now?

Patient: Okay — I did it. I breathed in slow, out through my mouth counting to four on the exhale; it eased the tightness for a single breath but my hands are still shaking and my mind's already back on the chair. If it comes back in the same way, give me one single, concrete thing to do right then that actually helps me stay with it — not a list, just one thing.

Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet being in contact with the ground, without trying to think about anything else?

Patient: Okay — I looked: faded green curtains, a sun patch on the rug, a chipped mug on the counter, a crooked photo frame with his picture. It steadied me for a breath, but my heart's racing, my hands are still shaking, and my mind's already back at his empty chair. How is noticing this supposed to stop the spiral long-term?

Patient: I did — I reached out and set my hand on the armrest. It's solid and a bit worn; it steadied me for a breath but my heart's still racing and my hands are shaking and my mind's already darted back to the chair.

If your mind snaps back to the chair at the table, and you place your hand on the armrest, I want you to look me in the eye and say, "I will get up and do something, right now." Not "I will try to do something," or "I'll think about doing something," but "I will get up and do something."

Patient: Okay... I can't really look you in the eye right now, but I'll say it: "I will get up and do something, right now."
