Patient: Hi — I'm a manager and lately I've been using procrastination to numb the uncomfortable feelings from my adjustment disorder, especially with ongoing financial stress. It's making me feel stuck and guilty, like I should be doing more but I keep avoiding it. I guess... I don't know, it's really hard to talk about.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically feels stuck for you in terms of tackling your financial stress? Is it the actual numbers, the decisions you need to make, or something else entirely?

Patient: I think it's less the raw numbers and more the decisions — I freeze when I have to choose, like what to cut or whether to ask for help. The uncertainty feels huge and I keep putting things off to avoid feeling ashamed or panicked. I don't know... I guess talking about it just makes me uneasy.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge how hard this is for you. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of putting things off, you made a small decision today, just a tiny step towards facing your financial stress, without any expectation of success or failure?

Patient: I guess if I made a tiny decision today I might feel a bit less panicked — like calling one creditor or deciding to skip one nonessential expense. But I don't know, I'm scared it'll be the wrong choice so I just delay instead. Can we... could we think about what one really small, low-stakes step would even look like?

Therapist: Let's break down the idea of "wrong" a bit further. What if "wrong" isn't about making a perfect decision, but rather about showing up and taking action, even if it's imperfect? Can you imagine taking a tiny step, like writing down one thing you're willing to try to tackle today, without editing or judging yourself afterwards?

Patient: I guess I could write down one tiny thing — maybe set a 10-minute timer to look at last month’s credit card statement or decide to cancel one small subscription. But I don't know, even that already feels... kind of big and awkward. Can we make it even smaller or talk about how not to let it spiral?

Therapist: Let's make the next step even smaller. Instead of writing down a plan or making a decision, can you simply observe the thought "I'm avoiding this" without judgment? Notice it arises, and then let it go, without trying to engage with it or push it away. Can you do that for just a few breaths?

Patient: I tried noticing it for a few breaths, but my chest got tight and my mind immediately started listing bills and things I should've done. I guess I felt like I was faking calm — I don't know, it just kept spiraling. Can we talk about how to stay with the feeling without it turning into frantic planning?

Therapist: Instead of trying to stay with the feeling, can we focus on the sensation of your body, like the tightness in your chest? Notice it as a physical sensation, without trying to change it or react to it. What's the sensation like, right now, without any thoughts or judgments about it?

Patient: It's like a tight band across my chest, heavy and my breaths feel small and quick. My shoulders tense, my stomach knots, and there's a kind of buzzy ache in my hands. I don't know — focusing on it makes me want to look away and start planning something instead; I guess staying with it just feels really uncomfortable.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together, and as you exhale, I want you to say "these sensations" – just those two words, without adding any interpretation or meaning. Can you do that with me? "These sensations"

Patient: Okay... I took a breath. "These sensations." I guess saying it made the tightness feel more real — my chest actually tightened and I wanted to look away. I don't know, it felt weird not to start planning right away.

Therapist: Notice that you're willing to observe your sensations, even if it's uncomfortable. What's one value that's related to taking action on your financial stress, and is related to the idea of observing your experiences without judgment? Is there something that feels important to you, like being honest with yourself or taking care of your well-being?

Patient: I guess being responsible for my family — wanting stability and not to feel like I'm failing them — feels important to me. But saying that makes me feel exposed and a bit ashamed, like I should've done more already. I don't know... can we think about one tiny, no-pressure step that ties to that value?

Therapist: Let's take it back to the tiny step. What if, instead of trying to plan a big solution, you simply showed up to one conversation with one family member today, and you shared one thing you're doing to work on your financial stress? No expectations, no pressure, just showing up and sharing a small part of your process.

Patient: I guess I could try — maybe tell my partner I'll spend 10 minutes tonight looking over one credit card statement, nothing more. I don't know, I'm nervous they'll react like it's not enough or I'll just clam up — can you help me figure out a super simple thing to say so I don't make it into a big deal?

Therapist: Before you talk to your partner, can you try saying something like, "Hey, I'm just going to take a few minutes tonight to look over my finances, and I want to make sure we're on the same page." Then, instead of making a big deal about it, can you focus on simply being present and saying, "Just looking at the statement"? No explanation, no justification, just "Just looking"?

Patient: I guess I could try saying, "I'm just going to spend 10 minutes tonight looking at the credit card statement." But I don't know — I'm already picturing them rolling their eyes and me shutting down. Can we… can we role-play that once or maybe make the line even more neutral? I'm not great at saying this without making it into a big thing.

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. I'll be your partner, and we can practice having this conversation. Can you imagine we're sitting in the living room, and you say to me, "I'm just going to spend 10 minutes tonight looking at the credit card statement." Then, instead of responding with judgment or criticism, I'll respond with a neutral phrase, like "Okay, that's okay. Take your time." Go ahead and say it, and I'll respond in a neutral way.

Patient: "I'm just going to spend 10 minutes tonight looking at the credit card statement." 

Okay... you said "That's okay." I guess saying it out loud made a tiny part of me breathe easier, but I'm already picturing myself getting up or turning it into a bigger thing. I don't know — can we quickly practice a super-short fallback if I start to bail, like a 30-second grounding script or something?

Therapist: Let's practice a 30-second grounding script. Can you repeat after me: "I am here, I am present, and I am taking one small step towards my goal. I will breathe in, breathe out, and focus on this moment."

Patient: "I am here, I am present, and I am taking one small step towards my goal. I will breathe in, breathe out, and focus on this moment."

I guess saying that made my shoulders drop a bit, but I don't know — it still feels strange and my mind wants to jump to planning. Can we have a very short fallback phrase I can use if I start to bail?

Therapist: Let's come up with a very short fallback phrase. Can you think of a phrase that you can use if you start to feel like you're getting anxious or want to plan? Something like "I'll get back to it" or "That's okay, I'll come back to it later"?

Patient: I guess something like, "I'll come back in 10 minutes," feels right — short and gives me a tiny anchor so I don't completely bail. Or if that feels too specific, "Not right now — I'll check back later" is more vague. I don't know, saying either of those still makes me uneasy; can we try the 10-minute one once now?

Therapist: Let's try the 10-minute anchor. I'll give you a nod, and you say "I'll come back in 10 minutes." Then, after 10 minutes, we'll revisit the conversation and see how you're feeling. Go ahead and say it now, and I'll give you the nod.

Patient: "I'll come back in 10 minutes." 

Okay... I said it. I'm already jittery and picturing myself getting up and avoiding it. Can you remind me to check in after 10? I don't know, I don't want to bail.

Therapist: Don't worry, I've got you. I'll remind you to come back in 10 minutes, and we'll check in then. Just focus on the next 10 minutes, and when the timer goes off, we'll take a short break, and then come back to it.

Patient: Okay... thank you. I’ll try to focus — I’ll set a 10-minute timer on my phone so I can’t pretend I forgot. I’m really nervous I’ll get up and avoid it; if I do, can you just ask me, “What happened?” in a calm way instead of making me explain? I don't know, I just don’t want to make myself feel worse.

Therapist: If you do decide to get up and avoid looking at the credit card statement, I'll simply say, "What happened?" in a calm and curious tone, without judgment or criticism. No questions like "What did you do wrong?" or "Why did you give up?" just "What happened?" Can you take a deep breath and remember that we'll simply acknowledge the fact that you had a setback, and we can try again if you're ready?

Patient: Okay... I took a deep breath. I guess I'll try to stick with the 10 minutes — I'm really anxious and I keep picturing myself getting up and pretending I forgot. If I do bail, please just ask "What happened?" like you said, because I don't want it to turn into a big scene. I don't know, I just feel shaky about this.

Therapist: Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and it's okay to take a break if you need to. But if you do decide to take a break, I'll be here when you're ready to come back to it. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Take care of yourself, and when you're ready, we can pick up where we left off.

Patient: I don't want to stop yet — I'm still really shaky and scared I'll freeze when I actually open the statement. Could we do one quick thing: help me make a 2-line fallback script to say if I open it and feel overwhelmed, and then practice you asking "What happened?" once more in that calm way? I don't know, I just need that.

Therapist: Let's create a fallback script. What do you think would be a simple, reassuring phrase you could say to yourself if you feel overwhelmed while looking at the credit card statement? Something like "I've got this" or "I can handle this" might not feel right, but what's one thing that feels more gentle and compassionate?

Also, I'll practice asking "What happened?" in a calm tone, just like we discussed earlier. Here goes: "What happened?" (said in a calm, non-judgmental tone)

Patient: Okay — a super short two-line fallback script I can actually say out loud:

"I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break."  
"I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute."

And... about "What happened?" — I guess I opened the statement and my chest just tightened, and I closed it right away. I don't know, it felt like everything I’d been avoiding was suddenly glaring at me, and I panicked.

Therapist: Great job on developing the script and taking a real-world step. Notice how your chest tightened when you opened the statement, and it's okay that you closed it right away. That was a perfect opportunity to practice your fallback script. You said "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break" and "I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute." That takes a lot of courage. Can you notice how your body feels now, and are you ready to try again?

Patient: My chest is still tight and my shoulders feel like a knot, my breaths are small and quick and my hands are a bit buzzy. I guess I'm willing to try again for one more minute, but I'm really nervous I'll freeze or close it again. Can you remind me to use the fallback lines and, if I bail, calmly ask "What happened?" so I don't spiral?

Therapist: You've got this. Remember to take a deep breath and say "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break" if you feel like you're getting overwhelmed again. And if you need to take another break, that's okay. I'll be here when you're ready. If you do decide to take a break, just say "What happened?" in a calm tone, and we'll start fresh when you're ready. Take one more deep breath and let's try again. When you're ready, say "I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute."

Patient: Okay... I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute. I don't know, I'm really shaky but I'll try.

Therapist: Take two minutes to breathe, and when you're ready, we'll try again. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and come back to it when you're feeling more ready. Just show up and take the next step. When you're ready, we'll keep going.

Patient: Okay — I did the two minutes. My chest feels a bit less tight but I'm still shaky and my hands are buzzing. I guess I'll try opening it for one minute, but I'm nervous I'll freeze; can you stay with me and gently prompt the fallback if I start to bail? If I shut it, please calmly ask "What happened?" because I don't want to spiral. I don't know, I'm trying.

Therapist: You're doing great. I'm here with you. Take one more deep breath and open the statement for one minute. Remember, it's okay to take a break if you need to, and if you do, just say "What happened?" in a calm tone. I'll stay with you and help you get back on track. Go ahead and open it now, and I'll support you.

Patient: I opened it for maybe twenty seconds and then closed it. My chest got tight, I started listing everything I owe and felt ashamed, so I shut it — I don't know, it felt like I couldn't breathe. Can you ask me "What happened?" like we practiced? I don't want to make excuses, I'm just really overwhelmed.

Therapist: What happened? (said in a calm, non-judgmental tone)

Patient: I opened it for about twenty seconds and then shut it because my chest tightened and I started listing everything I owe and felt ashamed. I don't know... I guess I panicked and couldn't stand feeling that way, so I closed it. I'm willing to try again but I'm scared—can we do an even smaller step, like just look at the very first line together, and remind me to use my fallback if I start to bail?

Therapist: Let's start with just looking at the first line together. I'll read it out loud, and you can follow along. Then, if you feel overwhelmed, just say "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break." We'll start fresh when you're ready. Here's the first line: "February's statement balance is $______".

Patient: Okay... I read it: "February's statement balance is $______." My chest tightened and I can feel myself start to freeze. I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break — I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute. I don't know, this still feels really hard.

Therapist: You're doing great. Take those two minutes to breathe, and when you're ready, we'll try again. Remember, it's okay to take breaks and come back to it when you're feeling more ready. You're taking care of yourself by prioritizing your well-being. When you're ready, we'll keep going. Take one more deep breath and when you're ready, let's try again.

Patient: Okay... I took the breath. My chest's still tight but I guess I can try to look at the next line — maybe just the due date, nothing else. I don't know if I'll last, so please remind me to say "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break" if I start to shut it.

Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a look at the due date. Here it is: "Due date: _______. Take your time, and don't worry about anything else. Remember, if you need to, just say "I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break." I'll be here with you. Go ahead and take a glance at the due date.

Patient: I glanced — it shows a due date and that made my chest tighten. I'm feeling overwhelmed; I need a short break — I'll breathe for two minutes and then try one more minute. I don't know, I'm really scared it'll make me freeze or start planning; can you remind me to prompt the fallback if I start to bail?
