Patient: Lately I keep noticing that whenever I get anxious around people—especially since starting this intense new program—I reflexively ask for reassurance from friends or coworkers to quiet the worry, and it just feels like a numbing habit I can't shake. I'm an artist, so I'm used to being outgoing and adaptable, but this has been getting in the way and leaving me more drained. Honestly, I'm pretty skeptical this will help—how is this supposed to help when I've tried similar things before and it didn't work?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it feels like when you're anxious and seeking reassurance from others? What's the immediate thought or feeling that you're trying to calm down when you reach out to friends or coworkers?

Patient: When I get anxious my chest gets tight and my brain goes straight to stuff like, "Did I sound stupid?" or "Are they judging me?" The immediate urge is to text or ask someone—"Was that weird?"—because hearing them say it's okay loosens the knot for a minute. It feels like I'm numbing the embarrassment or fear of being judged with other people's approval, but it never lasts and I just end up needing more. I've tried cutting down on it before—so seriously, how is talking about this supposed to actually stop me from doing it?

Therapist: I understand that seeking reassurance can feel like a quick fix, but it doesn't seem to provide lasting relief. Would it be possible to explore what might happen if you didn't feel the need for reassurance in the first place?

Patient: I guess if I didn't need that reassurance I'd probably feel less... fragile, like I wouldn't be hanging on other people's reactions to know I'm okay. Right now though, the thought of not asking makes my chest clamp up and I feel exposed and kind of panicky—I've tried sitting with it and it just spirals, so how is picturing it supposed to help me stop reaching out? Maybe in the long run I'd feel less drained and more confident, but honestly it feels unreal and scary right now.

Therapist: Can you imagine, just for a moment, that you're not seeking reassurance, but you're still standing in your anxiety? What might happen if, instead of trying to calm it down, you just allowed yourself to feel the physical sensations and thoughts without trying to change or escape them?

Patient: If I actually stood in it, at first my chest would clamp and my thoughts would race—I'd replay what I said, imagine people judging, and my hands would feel shaky. Maybe after a few minutes the knot would loosen and the urge to text someone would dull, but honestly when I've tried that before it just spiraled and I ended up worse—more panicked, more desperate for reassurance. I don't know, it sounds possible in theory, but how exactly is sitting with that supposed to stop me from reaching out in the moment?

Therapist: Let's try to defuse the "I need reassurance" thought by noticing it as just that – a thought. Can you say to yourself, "I'm having the thought that I need reassurance right now"?

Patient: "I'm having the thought that I need reassurance right now." Saying it out loud makes the thought sound smaller for a second, but the chest-tightness and the urge to text are still there—labeling it doesn't make the panic stop. How is that supposed to help when I've tried stuff like this and it doesn't change the compulsion?

Therapist: I want to try something different. Can you imagine taking a small, brief pause before reaching out to someone, and instead of seeking reassurance, you simply acknowledge to yourself that you're feeling anxious and unsure?

Patient: I can picture forcing myself to pause for like 10–20 seconds and saying to myself, "I'm anxious and unsure," and maybe for a beat the urge would loosen. But honestly, when I try pausing my brain just fills the gap with worst-case scenarios and then I panic harder and text anyway. How long am I supposed to sit with that before it actually does anything? What would I even do in that pause besides watch myself spiral?

Therapist: Let's take it one step further. What would you do with that 10-20 second pause if it didn't immediately turn into worst-case scenarios? What's one small, value-driven action you could take right after acknowledging your anxiety and uncertainty, that would move you closer to connecting with others and being your authentic self?

Patient: Maybe I'd take that breath, tell myself I want to be curious rather than safe, and then ask one small, genuine question—like “How do you see this part working?”—instead of fishing for validation about how I sounded. It feels doable because it’s aligned with being social and creative, not defensive. But I'm skeptical—how is that really supposed to override the itch to get reassurance in the moment?

Therapist: Let's try that approach now. As you take a deep breath and say "I want to be curious rather than safe," notice what happens to your body and mind. Then, ask your question, "How do you see this part working?" without waiting for a response.

Patient: I take a deep breath and tell myself, "I want to be curious rather than safe," and for a second my chest loosens and my thoughts quiet just enough to notice the panic instead of being swallowed by it. Then I say out loud, "How do you see this part working?"—and it feels weird to put it out there and not wait for someone to fix it. But honestly, the urge to text is still buzzing under that pause, and I'm left wondering how this actually beats the instant relief of reassurance.

Therapist: Let's try to observe what happens after you ask your question. Notice what sensations, thoughts, and emotions arise without judgment. Then, ask yourself, "What would I need to feel more confident in my approach?"

Patient: After I asked it, my chest loosened for a second and my head got quiet enough to notice the buzzy urge under everything—then the usual loop kicked back in: thoughts of "they'll think I'm needy" and a flicker of relief imagining a quick text. Emotion-wise I felt exposed and a little hopeful, but mostly wary.

What I'd need to feel more confident in this approach: a simple, repeatable tool I can actually use in the moment (like a 20–30 second grounding line I can say to myself), some small, concrete wins so I have evidence it works, and a clear fallback plan if the pause starts to spiral so it doesn't turn into worse panic. Also, I’d need to know this isn't just another form of reassurance—like a way to check in with myself or debrief after, not to get someone else to fix me. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when every time I try a "script" I still end up texting five minutes later?

Therapist: Let's work on creating a new script that's not about seeking reassurance, but about connecting with your own curiosity and creative process. Instead of a specific phrase, what if we focused on a physical anchor that allows you to pause and regroup? For example, can you think of a simple, non-verbal action that you can take to create a brief pause, like taking a deep breath, making a small gesture, or noticing a physical sensation in your body?

Patient: I could press my thumb to my ring finger three times and exhale slowly — it's discreet, tactile, and something I can do without drawing attention. When I've tried anchors before they buy me a few seconds but the itch to text still comes back, so how is a finger-press really supposed to stop the urge long-term? If it starts spiraling, a backup could be quietly stepping away for a minute or using a pre-written note to say I'm taking a breather instead of asking for reassurance.

Therapist: I like the idea of using the finger-press anchor and backup plan. Let's take it a step further. Can you imagine that with the anchor and backup plan in place, you're not just pausing and regrouping, but you're also making a commitment to yourself to explore this experience as an opportunity for growth and connection?

Patient: I can kind of picture it — thumb to ring finger, a quiet step back, telling myself this is practice for growth — and part of me wants to try that. But I'm skeptical: how is this commitment any different from the other stuff I stop doing after a week? I'd need a way to notice tiny wins and a concrete plan for when the pause starts to spiral—can we sketch out what those wins and that backup plan actually look like in real situations?

Therapist: Let's sketch out what a tiny win might look like. What would it mean for you to successfully pause and use the anchor in a real situation, without immediately reverting to seeking reassurance? For example, how would you notice the pause has been effective, and what would you do to build on that success?

Patient: A tiny win would look like this: my chest tightens, I press my thumb to my ring finger three times, exhale, and then I don’t text or ask anyone for five–ten minutes. I’d notice the pause worked if my hands stop shaking, my thoughts quiet down enough to focus on something else, and the immediate urge doesn't win. To build on it I’d log the win (even a quick note on my phone), give myself a tiny creative reward (sketch for 10 minutes), and set a small goal (like 3 wins a week); backup plan if it starts spiraling would be quietly stepping outside, sending a pre-written “taking a breather” message, or using a distraction call—not to get reassurance, just to ground me. But honestly, I’m skeptical—how is doing that a few times really supposed to change the pattern long-term? Can we try a quick role-play of a moment so I can see how it feels?

Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. Imagine we're in a situation where you're in a social gathering, and you start to feel anxious and want to reach for reassurance. You press your thumb to your ring finger, take a few deep breaths, and step away for a minute. As you're standing outside, what do you notice? What thoughts come up, and how do you feel physically?

Patient: Standing outside, my chest still feels tight but a little less like it's about to implode — the thumb-press gave me a tiny gap to breathe. My brain immediately runs through, "They think I'm weird," "Did I say something stupid?" and the itch to check my phone; there's also a faint, embarrassed hope someone will message me to make it go away. Physically my hands are a bit shaky, my heart's racing, and my face feels warm, but after about a minute the urge to text drops from frantic to background noise if I can focus on my breathing or notice the cold on my skin. I can see how this could be a small win if I don't reach for my phone, but honestly — how long do I need to stand here before it actually matters, and what if I just end up ruminating and texting five minutes later?

Therapist: You're right to question the duration – the goal isn't to stand outside for a set amount of time, but rather to use the pause as a stepping stone to a new way of being in the moment. What if, instead of waiting for a specific time, you used the pause as an opportunity to explore what's happening in your body and mind? Notice the sensations, thoughts, and emotions as they arise, and see if you can find ways to observe them without judgment or attachment. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to notice. My chest is tight, my breath’s shallow, my hands are jittery and my face feels hot; thoughts like “they think I’m weird” and replays of what I said keep looping, and underneath it all is this prickly embarrassment and a small, hungry hope someone will message me. When I watch them they do feel a bit smaller—like noise in the background instead of a roar—but they don’t go away, and I get impatient and scared it’ll just turn into rumination. How long am I supposed to sit with that before it counts as progress, and how is observing this actually different from just stewing in the same worries?

Therapist: Notice the thought that you're trying to observe: "How long am I supposed to sit with that?" This thought itself is contributing to the cycle of rumination. Can you try to defuse that thought by acknowledging it as just a thought, without judgment or attachment? "I'm having the thought 'I need to sit with this for a long time' – can I let it go for now and see what happens?"

Patient: "I'm having the thought 'I need to sit with this for a long time.' Okay — I can try to let that go for now and see what happens. But honestly, as soon as I try that I get this hot, familiar shame and get pissed at myself, like I already failed—so I'm worried 'letting it go' will just turn into avoidance or rumination. Fine, I'll try to drop the thought for a bit, but if the urge spikes, what's the concrete next step? How is this actually going to stop me from texting five minutes later?"

Therapist: Let's talk about what to do when the urge to text spikes. Instead of getting caught up in the shame or frustration, what if you take a very small, immediate action to connect with your values? For example, you could say to yourself, "I'm taking a break from social media for the next 30 minutes to focus on my breath and notice what's happening in my body." What do you think?

Patient: Okay—I can try saying to myself, "I'm taking a break from social media for the next 30 minutes," but I'm skeptical it won't kill the five-minute itch. When that urge hits, this hot shame kicks in and I get pissed at myself like I already failed, which makes me more likely to check my phone. I need a tiny, concrete script (3–5 words) I can use the second the urge spikes and a clear fallback plan if the pause starts spiraling—what would you suggest for those?

Therapist: Let's work on a tiny script and fallback plan. What if, when the urge to text spikes, you say to yourself, "Connect, not compare"? And as for the fallback plan, what if you simply acknowledge the urge to text and say to yourself, "I'm stepping away for a minute, and I'll come back to this conversation when I'm feeling calmer"?

Patient: Okay—"Connect, not compare" feels okay-ish but a little abstract. I’d prefer a shorter, concrete script I can actually say in the moment — maybe “Pause. Breathe. Create.” or even just “Connect, not compare” repeated once. But I have to say: saying any of those still sparks that hot, familiar shame, like I’ve already failed before I even try, and that makes me want to check my phone harder.

For a fallback plan I like: thumb-to-ring finger x3 + say the script, then either (a) step outside and sketch for 10 minutes, or (b) send a pre-written message like “Taking a breather, back soon” (explicitly not asking for reassurance). I’ll log wins in my phone and aim for 3 a week. 

How is that actually supposed to stop me from texting five minutes later? Can we role-play the exact words of the pre-written message and practice the script once so I can see how it feels?

Therapist: Let's practice the script. Imagine you're in a situation where you feel the urge to text, and you say to yourself, "Taking a breather, back soon." How does that feel? Notice the sensations in your body and mind. Now, role-play the fallback plan: "Thumb to ring finger, say 'Pause. Breathe. Create,' and then send the pre-written message. How does that feel?

Patient: Saying "Taking a breather, back soon" felt kind of hollow — my chest stayed tight, my hands jittered, my face hot. Thumb-to-ring x3 and "Pause. Breathe. Create" bought a tiny gap where the urge dropped to the background, but then that hot, familiar shame pops up and I almost automatically assume I've already failed. I guess it helps a little, but honestly — how is that supposed to stop me from checking my phone five minutes later if that shame keeps surfacing?

Therapist: Notice the shame response that arises, and acknowledge it as just that – a thought. You might say to yourself, "This shame is just a thought, and it doesn't define my worth. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not have all the answers right now." Can you try to offer yourself some kindness and understanding, just as you would to a friend in a similar situation?

Patient: I tried saying what I'd tell a friend — "you're okay, mistakes happen" — and it just sounded hollow, like the shame got louder and I started replaying everything. I'm worn thin and it's exhausting to keep trying this when that hot shame pops up, so I get pissed and reach for my phone instead. Okay — seriously, how do I make this self-kindness actually stick in the moment instead of just becoming more proof I failed?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of telling yourself to be kind, try to notice that the shame is not a reflection of your worth, but rather a signal that you're pushing against a boundary. Imagine that you're standing at the edge of a river, and the shame is like a ripple on the water. Can you try to anchor yourself in the bigger picture, like the river's current, and remind yourself that you're not the shame?

Patient: I can picture the river and the ripple — for a second the shame looks smaller — but then that hot, familiar shove comes up and I feel like I've already screwed up. It helps a little, but I'm skeptical: when that surge hits, what's the concrete thing I actually do to stop myself from grabbing my phone and spiraling?

Therapist: Let's focus on what you can do in the moment to anchor yourself in a more compassionate perspective. What if, when the shame surge hits, you simply acknowledge it, and then take a small, value-driven action that aligns with your values, such as taking a few deep breaths, noticing your surroundings, or engaging in a creative activity?

Patient: I can try that, but when the shame surge hits it feels like this old, burning “I already messed up” and I almost automatically grab my phone. Maybe something concrete would help: thumb-to-ring x3, say “Pause. Breathe. Create,” take three slow breaths, then do one deliberate 60‑second sketch or doodle. But if after that minute I’m still panicky, what’s the next real step—because I don’t want this to be another thing I half‑try and fail at.

Therapist: Let's refine the next step. Instead of relying on a specific action, what if you simply explored the pause itself? Notice what's happening in your body, what thoughts are arising, and what emotions are present. Can you try to observe the pause without judgment, allowing yourself to be with whatever is showing up, without trying to change or react to it?

Patient: Okay—I try to observe the pause: tight chest, looping "they think I'm weird," and this hot shame that feels like proof I already messed up. It does quiet things a bit, but the shame spikes and I almost automatically want my phone. If the 60‑second sketch doesn't settle it, what's the concrete next step—because honestly, how is this supposed to actually stop me from checking my phone five minutes later? I'm willing to try, but I feel pretty drained doing this.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and consider what's driving your desire to check your phone. What values are you hoping to meet by checking your phone? Are you seeking reassurance, social connection, or something else? What alternative values-driven action can you take that aligns with those values, and might actually lead to a more meaningful connection with others?

Patient: Mostly I reach for my phone for reassurance — to quiet that hot shame, prove I didn’t screw up, and feel seen so I’m not alone. I guess the values under that are safety (don’t feel judged), connection (not be isolated), and competence/acceptance (feel okay about what I said).

Alternatives that line up with those values: press thumb→ring x3 + “Pause. Breathe. Create,” do a 60‑second sketch (creativity as connection), send a non-reassuring note like “Taking a breather, back soon,” or post/share a tiny piece of art to connect without fishing for validation; if I still feel raw, set a 30‑minute timer and promise myself to only decide after logging a quick “win” (one sentence or a sketch).  

I’m worn out just thinking about trying this — the shame still screams that I already failed — so seriously, how does this actually stop the five‑minute check? Can we role‑play one of these exact steps now so I can see how it feels in the moment?

Therapist: Let's try the exact steps you outlined. Imagine you're in a situation where the urge to check your phone hits, and you say to yourself, "Pause. Breathe. Create," then do a 60-second sketch. As you're sketching, notice what's happening in your body and mind. How does it feel to be creating something, rather than checking your phone? Can you stay with that sensation for a bit?

Patient: I press my thumb, say "Pause. Breathe. Create," and scribble a quick sketch — my breath slows a bit, my hands stop shaking as much, and the looped thoughts quiet to a sort of background hum. There's this hot, familiar shame still lurking though, like a voice saying I already messed up, and that makes me half-expecting to grab my phone as soon as the minute's up. It helps for a tiny bit, honestly, but I'm worn out and skeptical — if the sketch doesn't fully settle me, what do I actually do next so I don't just check my phone five minutes later? Can we role-play the backup step for when the shame spikes after the sketch?

Therapist: Let's role-play the backup step. Imagine the shame surge hits, and you say to yourself, "I've already messed up." What do you do next? You decide to send a non-reassuring note, like "Taking a breather, back soon." As you type, notice what's happening in your body and mind. Can you stay with the sensation of typing, and let go of the need for reassurance?

Patient: I type "Taking a breather, back soon." My fingers are shaking, my heart's racing, and my face feels hot. Saying "I've already messed up" out loud pops up and the shame hits like a weight — typing the message gives a sliver of control, but it already feels hollow. For a moment the urge eases, then it starts buzzing again under everything. I'm worn out and frustrated — if this doesn't stop the check five minutes later, what do I actually do next?

Therapist: It's clear that the current approach isn't working as expected. Let's try something new. What if, after sending the note, you log the fact that you took a breather and sent a non-reassuring message in your journal? Would that help you feel more grounded and connected to your values?

Patient: Maybe—logging could help, but right now it just feels like another thing to mess up. Honestly, the shame's already loud and I can see myself writing a self‑bashing line instead of a win, so I'd need the log to be tiny and dumbproof — like a one‑tap checkbox or a 5‑second voice memo that just says “breather done.” 

Can we try role‑playing the exact one‑line entry and what I tell myself after (something realistic I won't roll my eyes at), so I can see if this is actually doable when I'm worn out?
