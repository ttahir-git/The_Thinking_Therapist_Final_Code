Patient: I've been feeling really overwhelmed by sadness and a lack of motivation lately, and it's gotten worse since I've been feeling so isolated. It's starting to affect my relationship — I pull away and my partner doesn't know how to help, and I feel guilty about that. I don't know, I guess it's just... hard to even say this out loud.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel overwhelmed? What's the first thing that usually stops you from doing something, or what's the first thing you avoid?

Patient: Usually I just shut down — I can't make myself do simple things like answer emails or even get out of bed some mornings. I start avoiding calls or plans, pull away from my partner, and sort of numb out with TV or busywork instead. I don't know, I guess I just freeze and then feel guilty about not doing anything.

Therapist: It sounds like taking care of daily tasks and connecting with your partner are important to you. What would happen if, instead of feeling stuck and guilty, you could focus on doing something small, like making a cup of coffee or having a short conversation with your partner, without feeling like you're failing or letting them down?

Patient: I don't know... maybe I'd feel a little less heavy, like there's some small win instead of everything piling up. I guess I'd still worry it wouldn't stick or that I'd mess it up, and I don't really know how to even begin — it just feels hard to try.

Therapist: Those are valid worries, but what if, instead of trying to push through or worry about not succeeding, you could just notice your thoughts about not wanting to take action, and say to yourself, "Okay, my mind is worried about not succeeding, but that's just a thought"? Can you give that a try for just this next small step?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — I'm saying to myself, "My mind's worried about not succeeding, but that's just a thought." I guess it helped a tiny bit, it felt weird though; as a social worker I know the idea, but it's different when it's my own head. I don't know if I can stick with it, but maybe I'll try it again before I tell my partner I need a minute.

Therapist: Let's take a minute to try a very small mindfulness exercise, just to help you get more comfortable with noticing your thoughts without judgment. I want you to take a few deep breaths, and as you inhale, say to yourself "I am allowing myself to feel whatever arises," and as you exhale, say "I am letting go of the need to control it." Can you try that for just 30 seconds?

Patient: Okay, I tried it for about 30 seconds. It felt kind of awkward — my mind kept jumping to the things I haven't done and I kept thinking, "I don't know if this is worth it." After a few breaths my chest loosened a little and I felt a tiny bit calmer. I don't know, I guess it helped a little but I'm worried I won't keep it up; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's completely normal for your mind to jump around and for you to feel like you're not doing it "right." That's actually a sign that you're getting closer to noticing your thoughts without judgment. Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. Your body felt calmer after just a few breaths, and that's a great start.

Patient: I felt a little calmer for those breaths, but it's weird — I'm the one who's supposed to help people, so asking for help makes me feel... exposed. I don't know, I guess I'm scared my partner will see me as failing, and I don't really know how to let them in without sounding weak.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your need for help, and it's natural to worry about how your partner might react. Can you think of a time when you've been open and vulnerable with your partner, and how that felt? What might it be like to approach this conversation from a place of mutual support and connection, rather than trying to hide behind your struggles?

Patient: I can think of one time — after a big thing at work I told my partner I felt overwhelmed and they just sat with me and made tea; it felt... relieving, less lonely. I guess approaching it from a place of mutual support might be asking for a little time and saying I'm struggling instead of trying to fix it or explain everything. I don't know, I'm afraid it'll make me look weak or like I'm dumping on them, so can we slow down? I'm getting a bit uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're concerned about being perceived as a burden, but you're also recognizing the value of connection and support. Can we explore what it would mean to approach this conversation with your partner in a way that feels more like a connection and less like a burden? What's one small thing you could say to your partner to start the conversation, like "Hey, I need some time to focus on myself right now, and I'd appreciate your support"?

Patient: Maybe I could try saying, "I'm having a hard time lately and could really use a little support — could we sit together for a few minutes?" I don't know, I guess that still feels like I'm whining or being weak. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to phrase it in a way that feels respectful and not whiny, but it's still a bit of a struggle. Let's take a step back and ask: what's most important to you in this moment? What would make you feel seen, heard, and supported by your partner? Is it just about getting help, or is there something deeper that you're hoping to connect with?

Patient: I don't know... I guess what's most important is feeling accepted and not judged — like it's okay to be messy right now. I think I'd feel seen if my partner could just sit with me, not try to fix things, maybe do small things like hold my hand or make tea. But I keep feeling ashamed, like I've failed before, and that makes me pull back; I'm getting a bit uncomfortable, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving a sense of safety and acceptance, which is completely understandable. Can you think of a time when you treated yourself with kindness and compassion when you were feeling overwhelmed or struggling? What would you say to yourself in that moment? Maybe we can try to reframe your request for support from your partner as an extension of that same kindness and compassion?

Patient: I don't know... I remember one time I actually tried to be kind to myself — I told myself it was okay to rest and made a cup of tea, and it helped a little, but then I felt ashamed like I shouldn't have needed it. I guess asking my partner for the same feels like admitting failure, and that shame makes me want to shut down. I'm getting uncomfortable; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's interesting that you're feeling ashamed about needing support, even though you were kind to yourself in the past. Can you think of what's unique about this situation, what's making you feel like you need to hide your struggles from your partner? Is it something about your self-image, your relationship with your partner, or something else entirely?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's mostly my self-image — I've always been the helper, the steady one, so needing help feels like I'm failing. There's this shame and frustration that comes up — like I let people down before and I'm terrified of being exposed again, so I just want to hide. I'm getting uncomfortable; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you've been carrying around a sense of self-image as a helper, and needing help feels like a threat to that. I want you to know that it's not a failure to need help, and it's okay to be vulnerable. Can you try to imagine that you're having a conversation with yourself, as if you were talking to a good friend? What would you say to a friend who's struggling and needs help? Would you judge them, or would you offer support and understanding?

Patient: I guess if it were a friend I'd be gentle — tell them it's okay to rest and that needing help doesn't mean they're a failure. But when it's me I just keep thinking I should've handled it, and that shame and frustration make me want to hide and get angry at myself; I don't know, it's hard to be kind to myself. I'm getting uncomfortable; can we slow down?

Therapist: It's amazing that you would be kind to a friend in a similar situation. Can you try to extend that kindness to yourself right now? Instead of judging yourself for needing help, what if you said to yourself, "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough"? No expectations, no judgments, just a gentle acknowledgment of your efforts and struggles?

Patient: I guess I'll try — "I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough." Saying it makes my chest tighten; I keep getting this rush of shame and it feels almost false, like I'm pretending. I don't know, can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's okay that it feels a bit like you're pretending. That's actually a sign that it's not yet second nature. Would you be willing to try something a bit different? Instead of saying "I'm doing the best I can," can you try saying "I'm allowing myself to be exactly as I am, with all my struggles and imperfections"? No judgment, no expectation, just a simple acknowledgment of your current state.

Patient: Okay... I'll try that: "I'm allowing myself to be exactly as I am, with all my struggles and imperfections." I don't know, saying it makes my chest tighten — I feel this shame and frustration rise up, like I'm being seen in a way I don't want. I guess it loosens a tiny bit if I keep breathing, but mostly it feels false and embarrassing. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're being exposed and judged, even though that's not what we're trying to do here. Can you think of a time when you felt truly comfortable and accepted, like you were being yourself without judgment? What values were present in that moment that made you feel that way? Maybe we can explore how to tap into those values and create a sense of safety and acceptance in our conversation.

Patient: I can think of one time — my partner just sat with me after a rough week and didn’t try to fix anything; it felt patient and accepting. The values there were presence, non-judgment, and steadiness. But when I try to reach for that now, this rush of shame and frustration comes up and I just want to hide — I don't know, I guess I'm scared of being seen as failing. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto that feeling of safety and acceptance from your partner, but it's slipping away because of shame and fear. Can you try to hold onto the sensation of your partner's presence and acceptance for just a moment, even if it's just for a tiny breath? Can you say to yourself, "I am being with this pain, and it's okay to be with it"? No judgment, no trying to fix it, just being with it as it is.

Patient: I don't know... I tried to hold onto that feeling and say "I am being with this pain," but it just brings up this rush of shame and frustration and I feel exposed. I get mad at myself and want to shut down, so it's really hard to stay with it. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's okay that it's hard to stay with the pain right now. Can we take a step back and think about what values are at stake for you in this moment? What would need to happen for you to feel like you're taking care of yourself and being true to who you are? Maybe there's something small you can do in this moment that aligns with one of those values, like taking a deep breath or saying "I need a minute"?

Patient: I guess a small thing would be to actually say, "I need a minute," and then take three deep breaths or make a cup of tea — something steady and quiet. But when I imagine doing that I get this hot shame and get frustrated with myself for needing it, and I just want to shrink away. I don't know, can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to protect you from feeling vulnerable, but that's not serving you. Can you try to imagine that taking a minute, making a cup of tea, or taking three deep breaths is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of self-care and self-compassion? What would your partner think if you needed a minute to collect yourself? Would they be understanding and supportive?

Patient: I don't know... I guess at their best they'd be understanding — they'd sit with me, make tea, not try to fix it like they did before. But the idea of saying I need a minute brings up this hot shame and frustration, like I'm exposing some failure, and I just want to hide. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to hold onto your shame and frustration, but it's not serving you. Can you try to imagine that your partner's love and acceptance is not something you have to earn, but rather something that is already present? What if you were to say to yourself, "I am worthy of love and acceptance, regardless of my abilities or shortcomings"? No conditions, no expectations, just a simple statement of fact.

Patient: I tried saying that to myself and it just brings this hot shame up—I get frustrated, like I'm exposing something rotten inside. I don't know, I guess part of me wants to believe it, but another part keeps insisting I'm not worthy and I get mad at myself for even trying. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like you're caught between two opposing narratives, and it's creating a lot of tension. Can you try to imagine that you are both the part that wants to believe in your worthiness and the part that is self-critical? Are they two separate entities, or are they intertwined? Maybe we can explore what happens when you try to reconcile these two parts, and what might happen if you were to integrate them?

Patient: I don't know... I guess they're tangled up — the part that wants to believe I'm worthy is there, but the self-critical part feels louder and kind of swallows it. It brings up this hot shame and frustration and I get mad at myself for even thinking about it, so I pull back. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to push the uncomfortable parts away, but they're always going to be there. Can you try to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment, like you're watching a cloud passing by? What if you were to say to yourself, "I'm feeling this shame and frustration right now, but that doesn't mean it's true"?

Patient: I tried saying that and it just... I don't know, it makes this hot shame flare up and I start thinking it's all true. I guess I could try to watch it like a cloud, but right now it feels stuck to me and I get mad at myself for not being able to let it go. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to watch the cloud, but it's stuck to you, and you're getting frustrated with yourself for not being able to let it go. Can we try something a bit different? What if, instead of trying to observe your thoughts, we tried to simply acknowledge them? You could say to yourself, "I am experiencing this shame and frustration right now, and that's okay"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try: "I am experiencing this shame and frustration right now, and that's okay." Saying it makes the shame flare up and I get angry at myself, like I've messed up again. I don't know, I guess it feels false and I'm getting uncomfortable — can we slow down?

Therapist: It's like you're trying to acknowledge your feelings, but they're still not feeling acknowledged. Can you try to see that your attempts to acknowledge and accept your shame and frustration are not failures, but rather small steps in a process? What if, instead of trying to "get over" your feelings, we focused on simply being with them, as they are?

Patient: I tried sitting with it and I just get this hot shame that makes me feel like I've failed all over again, and I can't stay with it — I get angry at myself and want to run. I don't know, I guess maybe a tiny thing like making tea or stepping outside for a minute might help, but I'm not sure. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you need a way to escape the discomfort of your shame and frustration, and small actions might feel like a way to temporarily alleviate that. Can we explore what would happen if you were to take a small action that felt more in line with your values, like making tea or stepping outside? What would be the consequences of taking that action, and how might it relate to your values?

Patient: I guess if I made tea or stepped outside I'd feel a little less frantic — like a tiny act of self-care that might let me be more present with my partner. But then this rush of shame and frustration comes up and I tell myself it's just avoidance or that it won't make a difference, and I get angry at myself for needing something so small. I don't know, I'm scared it makes me look weak, so I want to shrink away. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that taking care of yourself will make you look weak, but it's actually a sign of strength. What if, instead of trying to avoid your feelings, we explored what your values are around taking care of yourself? What would happen if you were to prioritize your own needs, even if it means feeling vulnerable?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually put my needs first I might feel less resentful and maybe I'd be able to show up more for my partner, but it also feels selfish and like I'm failing. The idea of doing that just brings up this hot shame and anger at myself, and I don't even know how to start without feeling like I'm letting everyone down. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.

Therapist: It's like you're trying to prioritize your needs, but you're also worried about how your partner will react. Can we explore what it means to show up for your partner in a way that feels authentic to you? What if taking care of yourself was not about being selfish, but about being a more whole and present partner?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually looked after myself more I might be less resentful and more able to be there for my partner — like showing up means being honest when I need a break instead of pretending. But there's this hot shame and frustration that keeps telling me I'm failing, and I get scared to say that out loud. Can we slow down? I'm getting uncomfortable.
