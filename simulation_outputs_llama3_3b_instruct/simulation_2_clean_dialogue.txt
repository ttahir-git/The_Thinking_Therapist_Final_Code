Patient: I've been feeling really stuck lately — like my identity is just the person who runs my business and I don't know what matters beyond that. With the kids gone and some PTSD stuff I've been dealing with, I keep feeling directionless and second-guessing everything. I don't really like talking about this, so... I guess that's where I'm at.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it means to you to feel like your identity is tied to your business? What would your life look like if you didn't have that connection?

Patient: It feels like the business is the thing that proves I'm competent and needed — without it I worry I'd be invisible or useless. I guess if I wasn't tied to it my days might be quieter and I could do more creative stuff or focus on relationships, but it also feels scary and kind of empty. I don't know, it's hard to go deeper into that right now.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being seen as incompetent is a strong motivator for you to tie your identity to your business. What would happen if you were to take a small step towards exploring other interests or hobbies outside of work, just for a few minutes a day?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd feel guilty or like I'm slacking, like I'm not doing what proves I'm useful. Maybe I'd enjoy a little painting or a short walk and feel lighter for a bit, but then I'd start worrying it's pointless or that I'm avoiding work. Can we not go too deep into this yet? It's... it's just a lot.

Therapist: I understand it can be overwhelming. It takes a lot of courage to even consider stepping away from work, even if it's just for a few minutes a day. Can I thank you for being willing to consider exploring other interests, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I guess... I don't know. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — it feels like we're going in circles and I'm getting overwhelmed. Can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm here to support you, and it's okay to take a break. Let's pause the conversation for a moment. When you're ready, we can come back to it. Would you be willing to take a few deep breaths with me and see how that feels?

Patient: Okay, I can try. I don't really know how to do it "properly," but I'll take a few slow breaths with you. I'm already feeling a bit tight and... I guess a little panicky, so can we keep it simple?

Therapist: Let's focus on your breath together. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. As you breathe in, allow your body to relax a little more, and as you breathe out, imagine any tension or anxiety leaving your body. We'll keep going at your pace.

Patient: Okay — I did that. I breathed in, held for a second, and let it out. It helps a little; my shoulders loosened a bit but my chest is still tight and my mind keeps flicking to the to-do list. I don't know, I guess it feels a touch less panicky but also kind of guilty — can we do a few more, but slowly?

Therapist: Notice that your chest is still tight, but the breath has helped your shoulders relax. What's the value that's important to you right now, and what would it mean to you to feel more at ease and able to focus on that value?

Patient: I guess what's important to me is feeling useful and connected — not just being the person who runs the business. If I could be more at ease with that, maybe I'd do more creative stuff, actually hang out with friends, and stop feeling like I have to prove myself all the time. I don't know, it's hard to picture and I'm feeling a bit guarded about going deeper.

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of feeling connected and useful is really attractive to you. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a small experience of feeling more connected and useful, without it necessarily being tied to your business? For example, what if, instead of being focused on work, you spent an hour with a friend doing something you both enjoy?

Patient: I guess that could be...nice — like meeting a friend for a walk or grabbing coffee and doodling or something low-key. But I'd probably be half-listening, worried about calls or emails, and then feel guilty like I'm slacking. I don't know, can we not go too deep into this yet? It's starting to make me anxious.

Therapist: I sense that you're feeling a bit anxious about exploring this further. That's okay. Let's take a step back and acknowledge the anxiety, and then see if we can gently explore it together. What would happen if, instead of worrying about your phone, you simply focused on the sensation of being with your friend, and the sounds around you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually paid attention I might notice small stuff, like my friend's laugh or the way the light hits the table, and it could feel grounding for a little while. But I can already feel myself slipping away, thinking about calls and emails and then feeling guilty for not working. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit anxious about going deeper.

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. Can I offer you a kind observation? It sounds like you're being very kind to yourself by acknowledging the anxiety and the tendency to slip away. What if, instead of trying to fight the anxiety, we simply allow it to be there, and then ask yourself, "What would happen if I gently brought my attention back to the present moment, without judgment?"

Patient: I don't know — I'll try. When I bring my attention back I notice my chest tightens and my mind immediately goes to the to-do list, but there's a tiny quiet spot too, I guess. Can we keep it slow? It's starting to feel a bit intense and I'm worried I'll start shutting down.

Therapist: Let's keep exploring this quiet spot together. Can you describe it to me in more detail? What does it feel like to be in that quiet spot? Is it a sense of calm, a sense of freedom, or something else?

Patient: I guess it's like a small pocket of space — not totally calm, more like my chest eases up a little and there's a quiet, like I can breathe without that tightness. It's more a pause than freedom, a little relief that doesn't last long. I don't know, I'm starting to feel a bit exposed talking about it — can we keep this slow?

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to explore this with me. I'm here to support you, not to judge. Can you imagine that the quiet spot is like a small refuge for you, a place where you can find some relief from tension? What would it be like to hold onto that feeling for a little longer, and see if we can learn more about what it means to you?

Patient: I guess holding onto that quiet spot longer would feel... sort of peaceful for a second, but also like it makes whatever's missing louder, and that scares me. My chest tightens and I feel exposed even saying that. Can we just try noticing it for maybe thirty seconds and then pause? I don't know, I'm nervous about going any deeper right now.

Therapist: I'm going to respect your boundaries and pause. Let's take a deep breath together and simply notice the quiet spot for 30 seconds. When you're ready, we can come back to it. Can you simply focus on the sensation of your breath, and notice if the quiet spot emerges?

Patient: Okay, I focused on my breath for about thirty seconds. The quiet spot came back a little — my chest eased and I noticed small sounds around me — but it was fragile and my mind kept flicking to the to-do list. I don't know, I guess it helps a bit, but I'm feeling exposed and anxious; can we keep going slowly?

Therapist: Let's pause for another 30 seconds and see if we can allow the quiet spot to stabilize. Can you simply notice the sensation of your chest, and see if the quiet spot emerges again? As you notice it, I want you to remember that it's okay to feel anxious - it's a signal that the quiet spot is fragile, but also a chance to explore what's driving that anxiety.

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I focused on my chest and the quiet spot showed up a bit — my shoulders loosened but it still feels fragile and then my mind spikes to the to‑do list. I don't know, I guess it helps for a moment but I feel exposed and anxious talking about it. Can we just stay with the breathing for another minute and not push any deeper right now?

Therapist: Let's stay with the breathing and the quiet spot for another minute. I want you to know that I'm here to support you, and we can take things at your pace. Can you simply focus on your breath, and allow the quiet spot to stabilize? I'll be here with you, silently supporting you.

Patient: Okay — I tried to stay with the breath for that minute. The quiet spot felt a bit steadier, my shoulders loosened, but my mind keeps snagging on the to‑do list and I feel guilty and exposed when we go deeper. I don't know, can we keep doing short, slow breaths and not push into anything else yet?

Therapist: Let's continue with short, slow breaths. Can you focus on the sensation of your breath, and gently bring your attention to the quiet spot whenever it emerges? I want you to remember that it's okay to feel guilty or exposed - it's not about achieving a specific state, but about allowing yourself to be present with the experience.

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing. I guess the quiet spot comes back for a few seconds but then my mind snaps to the to‑do list and I feel guilty. I don't know — can we keep the breathing a bit longer and then maybe talk about a small, practical thing I could try this week? I don't want to go deeper right now.

Therapist: Let's keep breathing for a bit longer and see if we can stabilize the quiet spot. When you're ready, we can explore a small, practical action you can take this week to bring it back. Can you think of one small thing that you could do this week, like taking a short walk or doing a creative activity, that might help you tap into the quiet spot?

Patient: I guess I could try a short, 20-minute walk a few times this week and put my phone on do‑not‑disturb so I actually notice the quiet. I don't know — I'd probably feel guilty and keep checking it, but maybe if I notice the guilt and take a breath I could stay with it for a bit. Can we keep this simple, and maybe talk through what I might say to myself when that guilt pops up? I'm kind of nervous about committing.

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. What would you like to say to yourself when the guilt pops up, to help you stay with the quiet spot? You could try something like, "I've got this," "I'm doing the best I can," or "I can come back to my phone later." Which one resonates with you, or do you have something else in mind?

Patient: I don't know — I guess "I can come back to my phone later" feels the most doable. Maybe tweak it to something really short I can actually remember, like "Later" or "This minute is for me." Can we practice that a couple times? I'm kind of nervous it'll feel fake.

Therapist: Let's practice the phrase "Later" together a few times. Just take a deep breath, and say "Later" to yourself. Notice how it feels, and see if you can bring your attention back to the quiet spot. As you practice, remember that it's okay if it feels a little awkward at first - the goal is to be kind to yourself and remember that this is a small step towards building psychological flexibility.

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Later. Later. Later.

It feels weird — kind of hollow but also a tiny bit freeing. I don't know, I guess it might help if we do it a few more times slowly? I'm nervous it will feel fake.

Therapist: Let's slow down and practice "Later" a few more times. Take a deep breath, and say it to yourself slowly: "Later". Notice how your body feels, and what sensations arise. Remember that it's okay if it still feels a bit awkward - the goal is to be kind to yourself and build on this small step.

Patient: Okay… (deep breath) Later. (breath) Later. (breath) Later. It still feels weird and a bit fake, but my chest is a tiny bit looser — can we keep doing this slowly a couple more times?

Therapist: Let's keep going slowly. Take a deep breath, and say "Later" again. As you do, notice what happens in your body. Notice if your chest feels any looser, or if you feel any other sensations. We can keep going for just a few more times.

Patient: Okay — (deep breath) Later. (breath) Later. (breath) Later. It still feels weird and kind of hollow, but my chest is a little looser. I don't know, can we maybe talk about when I'd actually try the walk? I'm nervous about committing.

Therapist: Let's talk about when you might try out this new skill. What's a specific situation or time of day that you think you'll first use the phrase "Later" when your mind starts to wander to the to-do list? Is it when you're in the morning, at lunch, or in the afternoon?

Patient: Probably midweek at lunch — like Wednesday around noon when I usually doom-scroll through emails. I guess I'll put my phone on do‑not‑disturb, step outside for a 20‑minute walk, and say "Later" when the pull comes. I don't know, I'm nervous I'll still check it, so can we talk about a tiny backup plan if that happens?

Therapist: Let's talk about your backup plan. What would you do if, despite your best intentions, you find yourself checking your phone during your walk? Would you try to simply acknowledge the urge and say "Later" again, or is there something else you'd do?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my backup plan would be to actually tuck the phone in my bag, put it on do‑not‑disturb, and maybe set one loud emergency contact so it's not totally off in case something happens. If I still check it, I’ll try to notice the urge without beating myself up, take three slow breaths, say "Later" and put it away and keep walking. I'm nervous about committing to this, but I can try and see how it goes.

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that this takes a lot of courage to commit to trying something new, especially when it involves challenging a deeply ingrained habit. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that this is a process. You're taking a small step towards building a more flexible relationship with your thoughts and behaviors.

Patient: I... I appreciate that, though it still feels scary. I guess I'll try the walk Wednesday at noon, but I'm really nervous—what if my PTSD or panic hits and I just freeze or start ruminating? I don't know what to do in that moment; can we plan a really simple, in-the-moment step I can use so I don't bail?

Therapist: Let's work on a simple, in-the-moment step you can take if you feel yourself freezing or ruminating. Can you think of a simple physical action that you can do right now, without thinking too much, to help bring yourself back to the present moment? For example, is there a specific phrase, gesture, or physical sensation you can use to anchor yourself?

Patient: I don't know — maybe something really simple like pressing my feet into the ground and taking three slow breaths, or squeezing my keys and noticing the texture. I guess if I freeze I'll say "Later" once, press my feet, and breathe. Can we keep it really simple?

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, the goal is not to achieve a specific state or outcome, but to develop a simple, flexible response that you can use in the moment. You can always refine and adjust as you go, but for now, let's focus on taking small, committed actions towards building your psychological flexibility.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try that, but I'm really nervous it'll feel fake or I'll still freeze. Can we practice it now? Like, can you guide me through pressing my feet and taking those three breaths so I can feel what it would actually be like in the moment?
