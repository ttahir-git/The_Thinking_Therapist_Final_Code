Patient: I'm an older software developer, and I've been stuck in a loop of harsh self-criticism — I keep replaying academic failures from decades ago even though I had success in my career afterward. Losing my partner has made those feelings worse and more constant. How is that supposed to help? I've tried that, it doesn't work.

Therapist: Can you think of one specific success from your career, even a small one, that doesn't make you feel like a failure when you bring it up now?

Patient: I can think of one: a few years ago I took a creaky legacy scheduler that kept crashing under load, rewrote the core module so it handled ten times the requests without failing, and that cut downtime and earned me a small bonus. But when I bring that up now it feels hollow—those old academic failures still shout louder, and listing wins hasn't really changed that for me. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you consider what it would be like if, instead of focusing on these past successes, you could acknowledge the skills and abilities you've developed over the years, without judgment, as simply a part of who you are, regardless of what happened in the past?

Patient: I can try to imagine that, but when I attempt to acknowledge my skills without judgment it just feels like glossing over the real thing — those academic failures still dominate. How is that supposed to help? I've tried listing strengths and repeating affirmations; I've tried that, it doesn't work, but if you have a concrete, specific step I can try, I'll do it.

Therapist: Would you be willing to try a small, temporary exercise where, when the narrative of your past failures arises, you say to yourself "That's a story my mind is telling me," without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: I can try that, but I'm skeptical — saying "that's a story my mind is telling me" feels a bit… abstract. How is that supposed to help? Do you want me to say it out loud or silently, right when the thought pops up or after it spirals? I've tried labeling thoughts before and it didn't stick because the loop kept going; give me a concrete script or timing I can practice.

Therapist: Let's try a simple exercise. When the narrative of your past failures arises, after you've had a few moments of mindfulness (about 10-15 seconds), say "I'm not sure what to do with this thought, but I'm willing to try something new. I'll take a deep breath, and then I'll see what happens next." Try to keep the tone neutral and gentle, without trying to change the thought. The goal is to create a small, temporary opening for something new.

Patient: Okay — I'll try it, but seriously, how is that supposed to help? I've labeled thoughts before and it didn't stop the loop. If you want me to actually do this, give me exact steps I can use in real situations: should I say the sentence out loud or silently, how many breaths, and what do I do if it keeps spiraling?

Here's a concrete version I can attempt if that looks right to you: when the thought starts, count slowly to 10, then silently say, "I'm not sure what to do with this thought, but I'm willing to try something new. I'll take a deep breath, and then I'll see what happens next." Take three slow breaths (in 4, hold 2, out 6). If it keeps spinning, repeat up to three times, then do a quick grounding (name 5 things I see, 4 I can touch, etc.) — is that what you mean? And what about times I'm at work or driving — am I supposed to just do it silently? I'm skeptical, but I'll try it and see if it sticks.

Therapist: Your version of the exercise looks great! Counting to 10 before speaking the sentence creates a small pause, allowing you to create a temporary distance from the thought. Silently saying the sentence can be a good starting point, especially in situations where you're in public or can't easily be interrupted. 

To adapt this to different situations, you can try:

* At work: say the sentence quietly to yourself while sitting at your desk or during a short break
* In daily activities: say the sentence to yourself while doing tasks like taking a shower or walking
* When driving: take a few deep breaths and say the sentence silently to yourself, focusing on your breath and the road
* In situations where you feel stuck: pause for a moment, take a few deep breaths, and say the sentence to yourself before acting

If the thought spirals, your plan of repeating the sentence up to three times and then grounding is excellent. Grounding techniques can help bring you back to the present moment and reduce the intensity of the thought. Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This can help create a sense of connection to your current experience and reduce the influence of the thought.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the thought entirely but to create a new relationship with it, allowing you to respond more skillfully and compassionately to your emotions.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when grief hits and those old failures start shouting louder than anything else? I like the exact script you laid out (count to 10, silently say the line, three breaths in 4/hold 2/out 6, repeat up to three times, then 5-4-3-2-1 grounding) — would a one-line cue I can stick to my monitor (like "pause — breathe") be useful to remember it? If that only delays the spiral, what's the concrete next step you want me to do — call someone, step outside, switch to a task — I need a fallback plan that actually works for those worse moments.

Therapist: I'm glad you liked the script! Having a one-line cue to remember it, like "pause — breathe," can be helpful in moments when you need to recall it quickly. However, I understand that this might not be enough to prevent the spiral.

In those moments when the emotional intensity peaks, a fallback plan can be to take a short, tangible action that helps you create some space. This can be as simple as:

* Getting up from your chair and taking a few steps away from the situation (even just to the window or another room)
* Making a cup of tea or water to give yourself a brief break
* Sending a brief text or email to a friend or family member to break the isolation
* Doing a quick 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise, as you've already learned

This physical action can help create a small pause, giving you time to regroup and reorient yourself. Once you've taken a few moments to collect yourself, you can return to the script and try to re-establish the pause and breathing pattern.

Remember, the goal is not to avoid the emotions but to create a new relationship with them, allowing you to respond more skillfully and compassionately.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the sticky-note cue and the breathing script, that seems doable. But seriously, how is calling someone supposed to help when I don't want to burden them or even know what to say? Can you give me a one-line text template I could send when I'm spiraling and a tiny in-place action for when I'm stuck at my desk and can't leave?

Therapist: Here's a one-line text template you can send to a trusted friend or family member when you're feeling stuck:

"Hey, just needed a quick moment of space. I'm feeling [emotion] about [specific situation]."

This message acknowledges your emotional state and lets the other person know you need a brief pause. It's not a burden; it's just a request for a moment of support.

For in-place actions, when you're stuck at your desk, you can try:

* Taking a few slow, deep breaths
* Focusing on a small, calming sensation in your body (e.g., the feeling of your feet on the ground)
* Noticing the sensation of your hands on the keyboard or mouse
* Doing a quick, subtle movement, like tapping your pen on the desk or stretching your arms up

These tiny actions can help create a brief pause, allowing you to re-establish the script and regain some control over your emotions.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the sticky-note and the text, but I'm still worried I'll be a bother if they don't reply. How is that supposed to help in the moment when I'm spiraling and nobody answers? Can you give me a one-line "urgent" template I can use (something like "Can't talk now — feeling overwhelmed, can you check in later?"), plus a coworker-safe version? For the desk fallback, pick one exact tiny action I should do if it keeps spiraling after the three repeats — for example, hold a cold mug for 60 seconds or press my feet flat and count to 30 — I need a single concrete thing to default to. I'm willing to try these once a day, but I'm not confident it will stick.

Therapist: For the "urgent" template, here are two options:

* Coworker-safe version: "Feeling overwhelmed at work, can we touch base later about [topic]?"
* Friend or family member-friendly version: "Hey, feeling completely lost and need a minute, can we catch up later?"

These messages acknowledge the urgency and let the recipient know you need a break, without being too intrusive.

For the desk fallback, when the spiral continues after the three repeats, I recommend:

* Holding a cold, wet washcloth for 60 seconds

This physical action can help create a distinct pause, allowing you to regain some control over your emotions. The sensation of the cold washcloth can be a tangible anchor, helping you return to the present moment.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the spiral entirely but to create a new relationship with your emotions, allowing you to respond more skillfully and compassionately. By having these templates and fallback plans, you're taking small steps towards developing greater emotional resilience.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the sticky note, the templates, and the washcloth idea, but how is holding a cold washcloth supposed to help when I’m in the middle of a meeting or don’t have one at my desk? Could I use cold water on my wrists or a quick face splash instead? And if I do this once a day and it doesn’t stick, what concrete measure of progress should I expect before I decide it’s not worth the bother? Honestly, I’m already feeling a bit worn out just thinking about adding all this to my routine.

Therapist: For situations where a cold washcloth isn't available, here are two alternative ideas:

* Using cold water on your wrists or a quick face splash: This can create a brief, sensory shift, helping you feel more grounded and calm.
* Taking a few deep breaths while noticing the sensation of your feet on the floor: This can help you focus on the present moment and create a sense of connection to your body.

Regarding progress, it's essential to be patient and kind to yourself. Expecting significant changes in a short period can be discouraging. Here's a more realistic measure of progress:

* If you try the sticky note, templates, and washcloth (or alternative) for 2-3 days, and you feel a slight reduction in the intensity of the spiral, it's a small step forward.
* If you notice you're able to pause for a few seconds (even if it's just 2-3 seconds) before the spiral starts, that's progress too.
* If you can recall the script or template more easily, or if you feel a sense of familiarity with the process, that's a sign that your brain is starting to rewire and adapt.

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the spiral entirely but to develop greater emotional resilience and learn to respond more skillfully to difficult emotions. By taking small steps towards this goal, you're already making progress, even if it doesn't feel like it.

Patient: Okay — I'm already feeling worn out just thinking about adding all this, so forgive me if I sound blunt: how is that supposed to help when grief spikes and nothing else seems to cut through? I need concrete metrics — tell me exactly what to track (number of spirals per day? peak intensity on a 1–10 scale?), and how long I should try this before deciding it's not worth the bother (days? weeks?). Also give me a single, step-by-step fallback I can use in a meeting when I can't leave (exact silent words, number counts, breath timing, then cold-wrist splash, then send the urgent text) — I need a checklist I can follow when I'm panicking. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: To track progress, consider the following metrics:

* Number of spirals per day: Track the number of times you feel overwhelmed and the spiral occurs.
* Peak intensity on a 1-10 scale: Rate the intensity of your emotional state when the spiral occurs. This can help you identify patterns and trends.
* Duration of spirals: Note how long the spiral lasts, from onset to resolution.

As for trying it before deciding it's not worth the bother, I recommend a 6-week trial period. This allows you to establish a routine and see if the techniques have a significant impact on your daily spirals.

Now, for the fallback plan in a meeting:

**Meeting Fallback Checklist:**

1. When you feel the spiral starting (silent, without drawing attention):
	* Say to yourself: "Pause" (count to 1)
	* Take 3 slow, deep breaths in 4, hold for 2, out 6
	* Repeat the sequence 2 more times if needed
2. If the spiral continues:
	* Quickly look at your watch and say: "Time to check in"
	* Send an urgent text using one of the templates (e.g., "Hey, feeling overwhelmed at work, can we touch base later about [topic]?")
3. Immediately after sending the text:
	* Use a cold-wrist splash (quickly splash cold water on your wrists or take a quick face splash)
	* Take a few more deep breaths to calm down

Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the spiral entirely but to create a new relationship with your emotions, allowing you to respond more skillfully and compassionately.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the checklist, but honestly, how is that supposed to help when grief hits and the whole thing just overwhelms me? Give me a one-line logging format I can actually manage (I’m thinking: Date/Time — Trigger — Intensity 1–10 — Duration (mins) — Technique used — Outcome Y/N). Also tell me exactly what counts as “meaningful improvement” (2‑point drop in intensity? 30% shorter duration?) so I know when to keep going or change course. For meetings, confirm this single default script I’ll use silently: “Pause. I’m not sure what to do with this thought — I’ll breathe and then decide.” Count to 1, do three breaths (4/2/6), repeat once if needed, then quick cold-wrist splash — is that it? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.

Therapist: **One-line logging format:**

Date/Time — Trigger — Intensity 1–10 — Duration (mins) — Technique used — Outcome Y/N

Example:
2023-02-20 10:45 — Academic failure thoughts — 8/10 — 5 mins — Breathing exercise — Partial

**Meaningful improvement:**

* A 2-point drop in intensity on the 1–10 scale (e.g., from 8 to 6)
* A 30% reduction in duration (e.g., from 5 mins to 3.5 mins)
* Consistently using the logging format and techniques for at least 4 consecutive days

Regarding the meeting fallback script, I've double-checked the original instructions:

* Count to 1: "Pause"
* Do three breaths (4/2/6)
* Repeat once if needed
* Quick cold-wrist splash
* Send an urgent text using one of the templates

This should be a concise and effective script to use in a meeting when you can't leave. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate the spiral entirely but to create a new relationship with your emotions, allowing you to respond more skillfully and compassionately.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the one-line log (probably in my phone notes or on a sticky), but how is that supposed to help if the numbers bounce around? A few quick clarifying things so I actually follow this:

- Does “Outcome Y/N” mean Y if intensity dropped by at least 2 points or duration cut by 30%?  
- For mixed episodes (grief + academic memories), do I list both triggers or the dominant one?  
- If a spiral hits 9–10 and doesn’t ease in 10 minutes, what’s the concrete escalation you want me to do — call someone, leave work, or something else?

I’m already feeling worn out just planning this, so can we slow down — give me one single prioritized thing to do tomorrow morning (no more than 30 seconds) so I don’t feel buried, and tell me exactly how you’ll want me to report back next time. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m still struggling.

Therapist: * "Outcome Y/N" means:
	+ Y: The intensity dropped by at least 2 points on the 1–10 scale, or the duration decreased by 30%.
	+ N: The intensity remained the same or increased, or the duration didn't decrease by 30%.
* For mixed episodes (grief + academic memories), list the **dominant trigger**, which is the one that's currently most prominent in your mind.
* If a spiral hits 9–10 and doesn't ease in 10 minutes, I recommend taking a **short break (5-10 minutes) to step outside** and get some fresh air or do a quick mindfulness exercise. If you can't leave work, try to find a quiet space to sit and breathe for a few minutes. If neither option is feasible, send an urgent text using one of the templates.

Prioritized task for tomorrow morning (30 seconds):

Take a few minutes to write down 3 things you're **grateful for** today. This can be as simple as a good cup of coffee, a beautiful sunset, or a supportive conversation with a friend. Focus on the present moment and let gratitude help shift your emotional tone.

Next time, I'd like you to report back by sharing one of the following:

* A notable insight or "aha" moment from your one-line log
* A challenging situation you faced and how you responded (using the techniques we discussed)
* A question or area where you'd like to explore further

This will help me understand your progress and provide more tailored guidance.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the 30-second gratitude thing tomorrow morning and jot down three small things. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when grief hits the moment I wake up? If I draw a blank, can I count obvious, neutral facts (e.g., "coffee is hot," "the heater’s on") instead of trying for Big Feelings? 

I’ll report back with one log entry in your one-line format (Date/Time — Trigger — Intensity — Duration — Technique — Outcome) and one brief note about how the gratitude step felt — whether it eased anything or just felt hollow.
