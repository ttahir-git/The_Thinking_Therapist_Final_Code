Patient: Lately I can't stop worrying about whether I'm doing enough at work — I'm a teacher and every lesson or set of grades feels like it could be judged as not good enough. That worry just makes me procrastinate; I delay planning or marking because I'm afraid it'll all fall apart. I've tried fixes before and I'm skeptical this will help, but that's what’s been on my mind.

Therapist: Can you think of one specific lesson or grading situation that's been weighing heavily on your mind, and what's the exact thought or image that keeps coming up for you when you think about it?

Patient: There's a pile of midterm essays I haven't finished marking that I need to return tomorrow, and I keep picturing handing them back and a student or a parent spotting a mistake and making a big deal about it. The image that plays is me freezing at the front of the room, everyone noticing, and the thought is, "They're going to see I'm a fraud" or "I can't do this." I've tried breaking tasks down and talking myself through it before and it doesn't change the panic—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: That thought "I'm a fraud" sounds really painful. I can see how that would be overwhelming. What would it be like for you if, instead of believing that thought, you could see it as just a product of your mind, like a thought in your head that doesn't necessarily reflect reality? Would you be willing to try to observe that thought without judgment, just for a moment, as you're marking these essays?

Patient: I can... I guess I can try to observe it, but I'm really skeptical. When I'm actually marking, that image isn't just a thought — it's a tight knot in my chest and I can't imagine stepping back from it. How is that supposed to help? I've tried mindfulness and reframing before; they calm me for a bit but the panic comes back, so I don't expect much — but okay, I'll try to notice it for a minute while I work and see what happens.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body as you mark, particularly when the "fraud" thought comes up. Are there any areas of tension or tightness that you could release as you breathe in and out?

Patient: My chest goes tight, my shoulders hunch up, and my jaw and hands feel clenched like I'm bracing for something. I can try to breathe and let my shoulders drop and unclench my jaw, but honestly it only loosens for a minute before the knot's back — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting some temporary relief with breathing and releasing physical tension, but the knot comes back. What if, instead of trying to breathe your way out of it, we tried to think of what would make it less necessary to have this knot in the first place? What would it mean for you if, as you mark these essays, you could feel more grounded and confident in your work, rather than worried about being judged?

Patient: It would mean I could actually sit down and finish the marking instead of stalling until it's unbearable, and maybe stop losing sleep over every parent email. I'd feel less like I'm one mistake away from being exposed and maybe a bit more steady at work instead of constantly frazzled. But honestly—how is that supposed to help? I’ve imagined that before and it still feels out of reach.

Therapist: That sense of being "one mistake away from being exposed" feels really scary, but what's underlying that fear? Is it a deeper fear of not being good enough, or is it something else? What's the value that's driving your desire to be confident and steady at work – is it related to being a good teacher, or perhaps being able to care for your students better?

Patient: I think underneath it all is this old, aching fear of not being good enough — that if I slip up I haven't just messed up a lesson but failed the kids and maybe even jeopardized my job, which feels terrifying with bills to pay. I value being competent and dependable; I want to do right by my students and keep some sense of financial stability. I'm trying to see how naming that actually helps stop me freezing in front of a pile of papers — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like being competent and dependable is a very important value to you, and it's what's driving your desire to do a good job with your students. Can you think of one small, specific action you could take right now, while still looking at those papers, that would allow you to start feeling more competent and confident, even if it's just a tiny step? For example, would you be willing to take a deep breath, look at the first essay, and give yourself a gentle "thank you" for showing up to work?

Patient: I could set a 20‑minute timer and just open the first essay and read it — no grading, just note one thing I liked about the work. Maybe say to myself, "I'm doing this," as a tiny acknowledgement. I can try it, but honestly it sounds trivial and I'm not sure it'll loosen that knot — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Let's experiment with this tiny act of marking, and see what happens. As you read the first essay and write that positive comment, notice the sensation in your body, particularly the knot in your chest. What's the first thing you notice about it as you're doing this small action?

Patient: The first thing I notice is the knot loosens a tiny bit — not gone, just a little room to breathe — my shoulders drop and my jaw unclenches while I read. For a second I even feel a flicker of, "Okay, I can do this," but almost immediately the doubt creeps back in and I think, "That won't last." How is that supposed to help? I don't know if I can keep this up; it feels fragile and I'm already bracing for it to snap back.

Therapist: That flicker of "Okay, I can do this" is a great sign that you're getting some traction. Now, I'd like to explore what would happen if you were to keep that feeling of competence and confidence for just a bit longer. What would it be like to hold onto that sense of "I can do this" for 30 seconds, or 1 minute, or even just a few breaths, without it slipping away?

Patient: When I try to hold onto that "I can do this" feeling it actually settles into my chest like a quiet, cautious warmth — my shoulders stay down, my hands stop clenching, and the voice saying I'm a fraud quiets for a bit. I can keep it for 30 seconds, maybe up to a minute if I keep focusing on the paper, but it feels like balancing a glass on a sheet of paper — one wrong breath and it tips. Then the alarm clicks back on and I start planning excuses to stop. I can try to stretch that minute if you want me to, but honestly—how is that supposed to help me when it always snaps back?

Therapist: I hear you, it's like the glass is always precarious. Instead of trying to control it, let's explore what would happen if you could cultivate a sense of kindness and curiosity towards yourself, even when you feel like you're teetering on the edge. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the "I can do this" feeling, you could lean into the uncertainty and say to yourself, "I'm here, I'm showing up, and I'll figure it out as I go"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is leaning into uncertainty supposed to help when it feels like I'm just giving myself permission to mess up? Saying "I'll figure it out" sounds a bit like an excuse, and with bills and parents breathing down my neck, that feels risky. I can try the phrase, though, and notice what it does to the knot, but honestly I'm already bracing for it to do nothing. If we're doing this, what would I actually do next while I'm marking — a concrete step, not just words?

Therapist: Let's try a concrete next step. As you continue marking the essays, I'd like you to make a deliberate choice to focus on the process, rather than the outcome. Instead of worrying about what the parents will think or how you'll feel about your own grading, try to focus on the sensation of your pen moving across the page, the sound of your handwriting, and the feeling of the paper in your hands. What's the first thing you can notice about your physical sensations as you start focusing on the process?

Patient: My shoulders drop a little and my grip on the pen loosens — I can hear the scratch of the pen and it pulls my attention away from that tight knot in my chest for a second. My breathing eases a touch and the "fraud" voice quiets briefly, but I'm not sure I follow how paying attention to the pen actually deals with the bigger fear. How is that supposed to help when it always comes back?

Therapist: I understand your question. The idea isn't that paying attention to the pen will magically make your fear go away, but rather that it can help you cultivate a sense of being present and engaged in the task at hand. Think of it like this: when you're a teacher, what does it mean to you to be a competent and capable educator? What are the values that underlie that sense of competence? How does paying attention to the pen align with those values?

Patient: I guess being a competent teacher to me means being prepared, clear, fair, and dependable — showing up with good feedback so the kids actually learn, and not rocking the one steady thing that pays the bills. I can see how noticing the pen might pull me back into the work and slow the panic, but I'm not sure I follow how that actually quiets the "fraud" voice for more than a minute or two — how is that supposed to help when a parent emails or I see a mistake? Can you give me a concrete next step for when that panic comes back while I'm still holding the pen?

Therapist: Let's explore a concrete next step for when the panic comes back. As you continue marking, I'd like you to notice when the "fraud" voice starts to rise again. And then, instead of trying to suppress it or push it away, I'd like you to gently acknowledge it, just as you would a thought. Say to yourself, "Ah, there's that thought again. It's okay, I've seen this before." Then, what would you like to do with that thought, rather than getting caught up in it?

Patient: I think I could try the thing you suggested: when that fraud voice starts, I’ll say to myself, “Ah, there’s that thought,” give it a name, then put a small tick or dot in the margin next to that essay and keep going with the next one. Maybe I’ll promise myself a five‑ or ten‑minute “worry break” after two 25‑minute blocks so I don’t feel like I’m burying it forever. I’ll try it, but honestly—how is that supposed to help? It just feels like deferring the panic, not fixing the fact I’m scared of losing my job with bills and everything.

Therapist: I see what you mean about deferring the panic, but this strategy is different. Instead of putting the "fraud" voice away, you're acknowledging it and giving yourself permission to take a break when needed. Think of it like this: when you're driving, you wouldn't try to push through a red light because you're afraid of getting ticketed – you'd slow down and wait for the light to turn green. You wouldn't be avoiding the problem, you're simply taking care of yourself to ensure your safety. By taking breaks, you're doing the same thing – you're taking care of yourself to ensure your well-being, and that includes your ability to do your job.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when the panic hits and there are bills and a pile of work? Won't taking breaks just let the backlog grow and give me more to be ashamed of? If we're doing this, give me something concrete: what exactly do I do during a five‑ or ten‑minute "worry break" (am I allowed to think about the panic or not?), and what's a one‑sentence thing I can tell myself to get back to the next essay without falling apart? I'm skeptical, but I'll try it if it's specific.

Therapist: During your "worry break," you're not allowed to ruminate on the panic – instead, I want you to simply acknowledge the feeling, and then tell yourself, "I've taken care of myself." This allows you to prioritize your own well-being without getting stuck in the cycle of anxiety. As you get back to the next essay, you can say to yourself, "I'll give it my best shot." This small, assertive statement can help you transition back into the task at hand and regain your sense of control.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the break thing and the line "I've taken care of myself," but I'm still skeptical: how is that supposed to help when the panic hits in the middle of an essay and I can't even think straight? If it spikes mid-sentence, do I stand up and walk, make tea, do a breathing exercise, or just sit and repeat the phrase — what exactly do I do in that moment so I don't end up losing 20 minutes staring at the ceiling? I'll set a 25‑minute timer and try a ten‑minute break after two blocks, and I can say "I'll give it my best shot" to get back, but honestly I don't know if that's enough.

Therapist: When panic spikes mid-sentence, I'd like you to bring your attention to your breath, just for 5-10 seconds. That's it, just a brief pause. You can simply focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away. Then, you can look up at the essay and say "I'll give it my best shot." This small pause can help you regain your composure and refocus on the task at hand.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when it spikes mid-sentence my breathing ratchets up and focusing on it for 5–10 seconds feels impossible. How is that supposed to help if I try and it doesn't work and I end up staring at the ceiling for twenty minutes? I'm willing to try a very quick pause, but if it doesn't calm down, what exactly do I do next so it doesn't turn into a lost half hour?

Therapist: If the panic doesn't calm down after the brief pause, I'd like you to get up and take a short walk around the room. Even just a few steps can help your body and mind feel more grounded. As you walk, I want you to say to yourself, "I can come back to this." This acknowledges that the task is not the only thing that matters, and that you can take a break to prioritize your well-being.

Patient: I guess I could stand up and pace to the kettle or walk to the end of the corridor for a minute, but I'm worried it just looks like I'm avoiding the work. When it spikes I get shaky and my head goes foggy, so how is a short walk supposed to stop that? If it doesn't help, or if I can't leave the room because it's late at school, what's the exact next thing I should do so I don't lose half an hour staring at the ceiling?

Therapist: If the panic is severe and you can't leave the room, I'd like you to use a physical anchor, like tapping your pen on the desk three times, or doing a small stretch. This is not about avoiding the work, but about creating a small, physical sensation that can help ground you and signal that you're taking care of yourself. As you tap or stretch, I want you to say to yourself, "I've taken care of this moment."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is tapping or a little stretch supposed to stop the panic when my head goes foggy and I can't think straight? I'll try it, but if that doesn't help and I can't leave the room, what exactly do I do next so I don't end up stuck for half an hour; this is feeling like a lot to keep up.

Therapist: If the panic is severe and you can't think straight, I'd like you to make a clear, simple statement to yourself, like "I am enough" or "I can handle this." This is not about convincing yourself of something, but about acknowledging your current reality. Repeat this statement to yourself, even if you don't believe it, and then take a deep breath and try to return to the task at hand.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I am enough" feels thin when my chest's racing and my head goes foggy; how is that supposed to help in the moment? I'll try repeating it, but if it doesn't snap me out and I'm pinned to the ceiling for twenty minutes, what's one very simple, concrete thing I can do for the next five minutes to stop the spiral without leaving the room? It's just... a lot to keep on top of right now.

Therapist: If you find yourself pinned to the ceiling, I'd like you to simply say "I will breathe" to yourself, over and over again. This is not about trying to control the panic, but about focusing on the one thing you can control – your breath. Repeat the phrase "I will breathe" to yourself, even if it feels silly, and try to focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Patient: I can try whispering "I will breathe" a few times, but it already feels a bit thin — when it spikes my head fogs and my chest races and I just go limp. How is that supposed to help when the pile of papers and the bills are still sitting there? If that doesn't work, give me one very simple, five‑minute thing I can do right at my desk that won't look like I'm avoiding the work but might actually stop the spiral.

Therapist: If you're finding it hard to focus, I'd like you to focus on your body. Try to notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of your chair against your legs, or the feeling of the air on your skin. Simply pay attention to one of these sensations, without trying to change it or push it away. Notice the sensation for 5 minutes, without getting up or trying to do anything else.

Patient: I can try to notice my feet on the floor and the chair against my legs for a couple of minutes, though my mind feels like it wants to bolt and it all feels a bit heavy. How is that supposed to help if I can't make the full five minutes — what's one simple thing I should do next at my desk so I don't end up stuck staring at the ceiling?

Therapist: If you find yourself unable to focus, I'd like you to take one small, deliberate action at your desk. Choose an action that feels meaningful, like setting a pen down, or putting your hands on the desk. The goal isn't to solve the problem or stop the panic entirely, but to create a sense of momentum and agency in the midst of chaos. This small action can help you feel more grounded and in control.

Patient: Alright — I'll try the simple move: put my hands flat on the desk, set the pen down, press once, and say quietly, "I'll give it my best shot," then open the next essay. I don't have much faith it'll stop the spiral, so if that doesn't help and I still feel stuck at my desk, what's one very specific, non‑dramatic thing I should do next so I don't lose twenty minutes? How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: If you still feel stuck, I'd like you to take a sip of water from your cup. Just a small, gentle gesture, without any expectation of changing your state. Sometimes, a small, ordinary action can help create a sense of stability and calm. It's not a magical solution, but it can help you get through the moment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try taking a small sip of water and see if that steadies me. It still feels trivial though; how is that supposed to help when my chest tightens and my head goes foggy? If that doesn't work, what's one really simple, five‑minute thing I can do right at my desk that won't look like I'm avoiding work but might actually stop the spiral?

Therapist: If taking a sip of water doesn't work, I'd like you to simply continue marking the essay. Not grade it, not worry about it, just continue marking it. Keep writing, keep moving, and see if that helps you get into a flow state. Sometimes, getting into the task at hand can help calm the panic.

Patient: Alright — I can try to just keep moving through them without pausing to judge, but honestly it feels risky; when I push through I worry I'll be sloppy or miss something important. How is that supposed to help when the panic spikes? Still, a concrete plan helps: I’ll aim to write one short comment per essay — one thing they did well and one small suggestion — and keep my pen moving for a 25‑minute block, then take the break you suggested. My limbs feel heavy and it’s an effort to start, but I’ll try that now and tell you what happens as I go.

Therapist: Go ahead and start marking the essays, taking it one short comment at a time. Remember, it's not about being perfect or getting everything right, but about getting through the task. As you work, notice how your body feels, and if you need to take a break, just tell me and we'll take it from there.

Patient: I set the 25‑minute timer and went for the one‑comment‑per‑essay plan — got through six essays in the block and actually wrote one thing they did well and a small suggestion on each. The knot in my chest loosened a bit while my pen moved, my jaw unclenched now and then, but the fraud voice still sneaks in and makes me freeze; I ticked the margin like we said and kept going. It helped enough to make progress, but I’m wary — how is this supposed to help when it always comes back after a break? My energy’s low now and I could use a concrete next move: shall I take the ten‑minute break you suggested, and if so, what exactly should I do in those ten minutes so I don’t just ruminate?

Therapist: Yes, take the ten-minute break. I'd like you to do something that feels calming and soothing, but not too relaxing. Try listening to some calming music, or nature sounds, at a low volume. Sometimes, a gentle distraction can help calm the nervous system. Allow yourself to settle into the sound, without trying to analyze or engage with it intellectually. Just be with the sound, and see if it helps calm the knot in your chest.

Patient: Alright — I’ll take the ten minutes and put on some nature sounds at low volume and set a timer. I’m worried I’ll just ruminate about bills or the pile — if I start spiraling during the break, what exactly do you want me to do in the moment? And when the break ends, what’s one short phrase I can say to myself to get back to the essays without the knot snapping shut again — how is that supposed to help?
