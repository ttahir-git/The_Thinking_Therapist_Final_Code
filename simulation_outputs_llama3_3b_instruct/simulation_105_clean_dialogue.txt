Patient: I'm an older nurse and lately I've been feeling stuck, like my whole worth is wrapped up in the job and I can't figure out what matters beyond it. My OCD has flared up since a recent health scare and that's made everything feel even more directionless. I don't see how talking about this is supposed to help — I've tried stuff before and it didn't work — but I guess I'm here.

Therapist: What's one thing about your nursing career that, if you were to let go of, might allow you to reconnect with other aspects of your life that feel meaningful to you?

Patient: Probably the idea that my worth equals being the indispensable nurse — like I have to be the one who fixes everything and never needs help. If I could let that go, maybe I'd have room to care about other things — friends, hobbies, just being me off the clock. But how is that supposed to help with the OCD and the panic after my health scare? I've tried stepping back before and it just made me more anxious.

Therapist: Can you think of one small thing you could do this week, just for a short time, to take a break from the feeling of being "on" all the time and explore a different aspect of your life, such as calling a friend or engaging in a hobby?

Patient: I could try calling my old friend Carol for 20 minutes this week and actually talk about something other than work—like her garden or a TV show. I don't know if it'll calm the panic or mess with the OCD, but it's a tiny, doable thing. How is that supposed to help, though? I tried distractions before and it felt like avoidance.

Therapist: Can you imagine what might happen if you had a conversation with Carol without worrying about what she'd think of your life or your career? What would it be like to simply be present and engaged in the conversation, without trying to "fix" anything or use it as a distraction?

Patient: I guess I can picture it—just chatting about her garden or a silly show and actually laughing, not analyzing every little thing. It might feel oddly freeing to be just a friend instead of the fixer, but how is that supposed to help the OCD or the panic? I'm skeptical, but I could try and see if it's really different from just avoiding things.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "fix" your OCD or the panic, you were to allow yourself to be in a state of uncertainty and ambiguity, where you don't have to have all the answers? What would that feel like, and could it be a small step towards trusting that you don't need to be in control all the time?

Patient: I don't know — the idea of sitting with uncertainty feels like standing on a ledge; my chest tightens and my brain immediately wants a plan to fix it. Maybe it would be a weird relief to let things be messy for a little while and not try to control every outcome, but how is that supposed to help when my OCD is yelling at me to check and my body panics after that health scare? I could try staying with the discomfort for a minute or two and see what happens, but honestly I'm worried it'll just spiral.

Therapist: Let's try a tiny experiment: Can you take a few deep breaths and, for just one minute, let your mind wander without trying to "fix" anything or come up with a plan? Allow yourself to notice whatever arises, without judgment or resistance, and see what happens when you're not actively trying to control the experience?

Patient: I did it — took a few deep breaths for about a minute. At first my chest tightened and my brain went straight to checklists and plans, but halfway through a random memory of Carol’s ridiculous begonias popped in and I felt a tiny loosening, like I could breathe a bit easier. It was different but fleeting — how is that supposed to help the panic long-term? Can we try it again or do something more concrete?

Therapist: Can you commit to practicing this tiny moment of mindfulness again tomorrow, just for a few more seconds this time? Instead of taking deep breaths, I want you to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, noticing the sensation of the air on your skin, and letting go of any thoughts or plans that come up.

Patient: Alright — I'll try it. I'll do about thirty seconds tomorrow morning, feet on the floor, noticing the air on my skin, but I don't expect miracles; I'm worried it'll just make me obsess over sensations and trigger checking. How is that supposed to help when my brain keeps demanding certainty?

Therapist: Can you imagine what it would be like if, while noticing the sensation of the air on your skin, you were to say to yourself, "This feeling is just a sensation, and I can choose to let it pass without acting on it"? In other words, can you practice a sense of detachment from your thoughts, and simply observe them without trying to change or react to them?

Patient: I can picture myself saying that, but honestly it sounds too neat — like telling a tornado it's just wind. How is that supposed to help when my OCD and the health scare make every sensation feel like an alarm I have to respond to? Still, I'll try saying it quietly next time I notice the air on my skin for those thirty seconds and see if it loosens the grip or just becomes another thing my brain picks at.

Therapist: Let's try something more concrete: Instead of trying to say "this is just a sensation," I want you to try to label the sensation as a "thought" when it arises. For example, "Ah, I'm having the thought 'My heart is racing' right now." Can you try to do this for those thirty seconds tomorrow, and see if that shifts the way you're experiencing the sensation?

Patient: Alright — I'll give it a shot tomorrow morning for thirty seconds and try saying things like, "I'm having the thought 'my heart is racing'." I'm skeptical it'll help — my OCD might just latch onto the label and make it another thing to pick at — but I'll do it and see if it shifts anything. If it just ramps up the checking, what would you suggest I do in the moment instead?

Therapist: If the label "I'm having the thought 'my heart is racing'" becomes a source of anxiety, I want you to try taking a small step back and noticing what else you're doing in the moment. For example, are you tensing your shoulders? Are you taking a few deep breaths? Can you try to gently acknowledge these physical sensations without trying to label them or change them?

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. Tomorrow morning during those thirty seconds I'll notice if my shoulders are tight or I'm holding my breath and just acknowledge it without trying to change it. But I'm worried it'll just give my OCD another thing to pick at and then I'll start checking or planning to fix it — how is that supposed to help when my body's already shouting? If it does spiral, what would you actually want me to do in the moment to stop the checking?

Therapist: If you feel like your OCD is taking over and you're starting to get caught up in checking or planning, I want you to bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet on the ground. This might sound simple, but it can be incredibly grounding. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and let go of any thoughts or feelings that come up? In the moment, when you feel like you're spiraling, try saying to yourself "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" and bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet.

Patient: Okay — I'll try that: when I start to spiral I'll say "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" and press my feet into the floor. It sounds almost too simple and I worry it'll just give my OCD something else to fuss over; if that just makes me check more, what do you want me to do then? Also, talking about this is making me a bit breathless and overwhelmed — can we slow down and go step‑by‑step?

Therapist: Let's slow down and focus on one step at a time. Can we start by committing to practicing the "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" phrase for just one more day, without adding anything else to it? Can you promise me that you'll try it for just 30 seconds, without judgment, and see how it feels?

Patient: Alright — I'll do it. I'll try the 30 seconds tomorrow, saying "I'm here, I'm here, I'm here" and pressing my feet into the floor. I still don't see how that stops the checking if I start spiraling, so if it does, tell me step‑by‑step what you want me to do next, and can we actually slow down a bit? I'm feeling kind of breathless talking about this.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and slow down. Can you take a moment to notice how you're feeling right now, and allow yourself to relax just a little bit? If you feel like you need to, we can take a break and come back to this conversation when you're feeling calmer.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to breathe. My chest's tight and I'm hit with this shame and frustration, like some old screw‑up is sitting on me, and it makes me feel stupid and silly. I don't want a break, just to slow down — when I try to relax my brain immediately starts planning and checking and I get breathless. Can you walk me through one concrete, super‑simple thing to do right now, step‑by‑step, and tell me how that's supposed to help if the shame or checking ramps back up?

Therapist: Can you try to say to yourself, just one sentence, "I am okay right now," without adding any judgments or explanations? Just say it, and focus on the physical sensation of the words in your mouth. Don't worry about the content of what you're saying, just the sound of the words themselves. Can you try that, just for a moment?

Patient: I said it — "I am okay right now." Saying the words made my throat feel tight and my chest jump, like they were not true and I was faking it. That shame flared up and made the sentence sound hollow, honestly. How is that supposed to help when it just feels like lying to myself? If I start checking or spiraling, give me one concrete, step‑by‑step action to do right then, and can we please slow down a bit so I can actually follow it?

Therapist: Can you try to acknowledge that shame for one second, without judgment? Take a deep breath in, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling a lot of shame right now." Then, take another breath out, and say, "That's okay." Just two simple sentences, no judgment, just acknowledgment. Can you try that, slowly, and focus on the physical sensation of the words in your mouth?

Patient: I tried it slowly — "I'm feeling a lot of shame right now" made my face flush and my chest clamp down, and "That's okay" sounded like a lie in my mouth. How is that supposed to help when it just makes me feel more exposed and stupid? If it starts spinning into checking, tell me one concrete, step‑by‑step thing to do right then, and please slow down so I can actually follow it.

Therapist: Can you take one small step back from the conversation, and gently excuse yourself for a moment? Find a safe and comfortable place to sit or stand, and take a few deep breaths. Allow yourself to settle into the physical sensation of the chair or floor, and notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Just focus on the sensation of your feet, without trying to do anything else, for just one minute.

Patient: Okay — I'll do it now. I'm moving to a chair, feet flat on the floor, shoulders already tight, chest clamped — that old shame is heavy and makes me want to spring up and fix something. I'm going to breathe in for four, out for four, and just notice the pressure under my feet for a minute. If that shame or the checking starts to swell, tell me one slow, concrete step to do next, and please slow down so I can follow.

Therapist: As you're breathing in for four, out for four, notice the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor. Can you focus on the sensation of the weight of your body distributed evenly on the floor, without trying to change it? Try to stay with that sensation for another four counts, and then I'll guide you further.

Patient: Okay — I did the four‑in, four‑out and kept my attention on the weight under my feet. It settled me a little bit — I could feel the pressure under my heels and toes — but the shame's still there and my shoulders are tight and my brain's itching to do something. If this starts to spiral, give me one slow, concrete step to do next, please, and say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you say to yourself, "What is this feeling of shame?" Just that simple question. Say it to yourself, without judgment or trying to change it. Take your time, and focus on the words themselves, rather than the content of the feeling. Just say it, and see what happens.

Patient: I said it slowly — "What is this feeling of shame?" — and as soon as I said it my chest clenched and that old, stupid shame rushed back, my face heated and my thoughts scattered and I felt dizzy and breathless. I tried to notice it, but my brain's already reaching for a plan and for something to check. How is that supposed to help when it just makes me feel exposed and more on edge? If it starts spiraling, give me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you put your hand on your chest, just above your heart? Take a moment to notice the sensation of your hand on your body, the weight of your hand, the sensation of your fingers on your chest. Just focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or do anything with it. Can you stay with that sensation for just one more moment?

Patient: I put my hand on my chest — it's warm, my fingers feel light, my heart's pounding and my breathing's shallow and jumpy. The shame slammed back in and my thoughts immediately started racing to lists and fixes, and now I'm feeling dizzy and fidgety. How is that supposed to help when it just makes me want to check everything? If it starts spiraling, give me one very slow, concrete step to do right now and say it slowly so I can follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you take one tiny, tiny step back from the physical sensation of your hand on your chest? Gently, slowly, slowly, withdraw your hand from your chest, without trying to stop or change anything. Just take your hand away, and then... just pause. Don't do anything else, just pause.

Patient: I pulled my hand away slowly and I'm just... paused. My breath's shallow, my chest is tight, shame's prickling like heat in my face, and my brain's already grabbing for a checklist — it's jumpy and distracted. I don't know how staying paused helps; if this starts spiraling into checking, tell me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you take one tiny, tiny breath in... (pause) ...and then... (pause) ...slowly, slowly, slowly, exhale. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or do anything else. Just feel the breath, and then... (pause) ...just rest there, for just one more moment.

Patient: I did the tiny breath — slow in, slow out — and for a second it loosened, but then my chest tightened again and that shame flared up, and now I'm jumpy and distracted like something just buzzed me. How is that supposed to help when my brain's already grabbing for a checklist and I feel breathless? If this starts to spiral, tell me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and please say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you notice what you're feeling right now? Take a moment to acknowledge the physical sensation of the shame, without trying to label it or change it. Just notice it, like a sensation in your body, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling..." (pause) ...and then, just pause. Don't finish the sentence, just pause.

Patient: I said, "I'm feeling..." and then I just stopped. My chest tightened, my face warmed with that old shame and my thoughts scrambled into lists and what‑ifs — I'm jumpy and distracted and it feels like I'm dangling. How is that supposed to help when it just leaves me exposed and gasping? If this starts spiraling, give me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and say it slowly so I can follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you bring your attention to your feet, and imagine that you are standing in a small, stable box, with your feet firmly planted on the ground? Imagine that this box is strong and solid, and that you are safe inside it. Can you take one tiny step into this box, and allow yourself to feel the sensation of being contained and grounded?

Patient: Okay — I pictured the box and took a tiny step in. My feet feel a little steadier, like there's something holding me up, but that old shame is hot in my face and my chest's still tight and my head's already listing things to fix. How is that supposed to help when the shame and the checking keep crowding in? If it starts spiraling, give me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you allow the shame to be present in your body, without trying to push it away or change it? Imagine that the shame is a physical sensation, like a warm spot on your skin, and you're allowing it to be there, without judgment. Can you take one tiny breath, and say to yourself, "I am with this shame, as it is"?

Patient: I said it — "I am with this shame, as it is" — and it landed like a hot weight in my chest, my face flushed, my hands started fidgeting and my mind went straight to lists. It honestly just made me feel more exposed and jumpy — how is that supposed to help when my brain immediately wants to check and fix? If it starts spiraling, give me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, step‑by‑step, and please say it slowly so I can actually follow — I need something simple.

Therapist: Slowly, can you gently release your hands from their fidgeting, and allow them to rest on your thighs, or in your lap? Can you just let them be still, without trying to do anything with them? Just rest, and focus on the sensation of your hands relaxing.

Patient: Okay — I rested my hands in my lap like you asked. They're less fidgety, but my chest's still tight and that shame's prickling, and my brain's already listing things to "fix." How is that supposed to help when it just leaves me exposed? If it starts spiraling, give me one very slow, step‑by‑step thing to do right now, and say it slowly so I can actually follow.

Therapist: Slowly, can you notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body? Can you focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or control it? Just notice the sensation of the breath, and allow it to be there, without judgment.

Patient: I noticed it — the breath's coming in shallow and out tight, like it's not doing what it's supposed to and my chest clamps up. The shame prickles and my brain immediately starts listing things to check or fix, so just noticing it kind of made me more on edge. How is that supposed to help when awareness just feels like another thing to obsess over? If this starts spiraling, tell me one very slow, concrete step to do right now, and say it slowly so I can follow — and can we please slow down a bit?
