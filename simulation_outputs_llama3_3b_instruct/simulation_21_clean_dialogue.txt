Patient: I've been feeling really stuck — like my whole identity is just "student" and I don't know what matters beyond that, especially after that health scare shook me. I'm older, sensitive, and I doubt myself a lot, so it's been hard to find any direction. Honestly, I've tried therapy and other stuff before—how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it means to you when you think of your identity as just being a student? What are some things you've tried in therapy or other methods that didn't seem to work for you, and what was it about them that didn't resonate?

Patient: When I say my identity is just "student," I mean most days I wake up and the only thing that feels concrete is coursework and deadlines — everything else feels fuzzy or optional, like I don't have a core self beyond that role. I've tried CBT worksheets, mindfulness apps, career counseling, journaling, even joining a few groups, but they all felt either too mechanical or like putting a bandage on something deeper; journaling just turned into performance, and mindfulness felt hollow when I'm exhausted from the health scare. How is sitting and naming thoughts or doing breathing exercises supposed to help me figure out what actually matters when I can't even imagine a life that isn't all school?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a loop of just going through the motions, and that's understandable given the recent health scare. Can you imagine if you created some space to breathe, even if it's just for a moment, to notice what, if anything, feels different or shifts when you're not thinking about coursework and deadlines? Sometimes, taking a step back from the immediate struggle can help reveal new perspectives. Would you be willing to try sitting with the thought "I don't know what matters" for just 30 seconds, without judgment or trying to change it, and see what arises?

Patient: Okay, I'll try—but honestly I don't expect much. When I sit with "I don't know what matters" I just feel this hollow pressure in my chest, my mind snaps straight back to deadlines, and a voice says "you're wasting time"—it feels more panicky than revealing. How is noticing that supposed to help me actually find anything different?

Therapist: I'm not surprised that your mind keeps snapping back to deadlines and self-criticism. That voice can be really persistent. It might be helpful to acknowledge that you're doing the best you can with what you've got right now. Can you think of one small thing, even a tiny, insignificant thing, that you're willing to tolerate, even if it's just for a brief moment, without the voice of self-criticism? Sometimes, it's not about changing the thought, but about finding a tiny foothold in the present moment.

Patient: Alright—maybe I can try something small: make a cup of tea and sit by the window for two minutes without checking my phone. I can already hear the voice saying I'm wasting time and I doubt it'll shut up, but I can tolerate that for a minute or two. How is that actually supposed to help me figure out what matters, though?

Therapist: I think it's great that you're willing to try this small experiment. What I'm interested in is what's driving your desire to check your phone, even when you know it's not serving you. Is it a fear of missing out, or perhaps a sense of control? What would it be like for you to prioritize your own needs and desires, even if it means not checking your phone for a little while?

Patient: I guess it's mostly avoidance — my phone is an easy distraction when the deadlines or the health stuff start feeling too big; it's reassurance and a tiny bit of control. The idea of prioritizing my needs feels selfish and scary, like I’ll be forced to look at that empty space I don't know how to fill. How is saying "prioritize your needs" supposed to help, though? It sounds good in theory but I don't know what a concrete, non-performative first step would even look like that I could actually do without spiraling.

Therapist: It's completely understandable that the idea of prioritizing your needs feels daunting, especially when it's tied to uncertainty. Can you imagine what it would be like to take small, tiny steps away from the need for control? Instead of trying to fill the "empty space" immediately, what if you allowed yourself to simply be with the uncertainty, without trying to fill it? What would that feel like for a moment?

Patient: It feels weird — like a hollow heaviness in my chest and this prickly panic at the same time. For a moment there’s a tiny unclenching, but my brain immediately floods the silence with deadlines and that “you’re wasting time” voice. I get why you’d ask me to sit with it, but honestly, how is noticing this supposed to help me actually find what matters? If you want me to try, I could tolerate 30 seconds while holding my tea, but I’m already skeptical it’ll lead anywhere.

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty, and it's great that you're willing to try, even if you're skeptical. I'm not asking you to solve anything or change anything right now; I'm just inviting you to pay attention to the sensation of being with the discomfort. Would you be willing to take the same tiny step – holding the tea and sitting with the silence – but this time, without putting any expectations or goals on it? Just be with the experience, without trying to change it or push through it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try holding the tea and sitting for 30 seconds without expectations, but honestly I'm skeptical it won't just turn into more panic and that "you're wasting time" voice. If it gets too intense I won't force it; I'll tell you when to stop, and I don't expect any big revelations. Okay, let's do it.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to take this small step. Before we start, I just want to remind you that you can always stop at any time if you feel overwhelmed. Now, take a deep breath, hold the tea, and sit comfortably in the chair. As you hold it, notice the sensation of the cup in your hands, the weight of the tea, and the sensation of sitting. When you're ready, slowly start to bring your attention to your breath, noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. When you feel like you're getting too anxious or the "you're wasting time" voice starts to creep in, I want you to acknowledge it and gently say to yourself, "Okay, I'm feeling anxious right now." No judgment, no trying to push it away – just acknowledging the sensation. Let's start with 30 seconds.

Patient: I did it — held the tea and tried to breathe. My hands noticed the warmth, my breath felt shallow, and my chest tightened, and when the voice came I said out loud, "Okay, I'm feeling anxious right now." There was a tiny unclenching for a second, but the "you're wasting time" voice kept talking and I felt kind of ridiculous and more skeptical than before. How is that supposed to help me actually figure out what matters beyond being a student — noticing the feeling didn't point me anywhere concrete; what else could we try that isn't just more noticing?

Therapist: I'm glad you felt like you had a tiny unclenching, even if the voice came back. That's a great sign that you're becoming more aware of your experiences. What if, instead of just noticing your thoughts and feelings, we tried to explore what would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the anxiety without trying to change it or push it away? What if you allowed yourself to feel the tightness in your chest and the voice in your head, without trying to fight it or judge it? What would that feel like?

Patient: When I try just letting the anxiety be, it feels like surrendering to this heavy, hollow weight — there’s a tiny ease for a second and then the worry swallows it up and I feel useless. It also scares me, because “sitting with it” feels like opening a door I’m not sure I can close without derailing my studies. How is that supposed to lead me to knowing what matters, though? If you want me to try more, give me one concrete, time‑limited thing to do that isn’t just breathing or journaling — something practical I can actually tolerate, because I've tried the usual stuff and it just feels performative.

Therapist: I understand your concerns, and it's completely reasonable to feel scared about losing control. What if, instead of trying to surrender, we tried to explore what's driving your fear of feeling useless? What is it about feeling useless that makes you feel like you'll lose control? Is it the fear of not meeting expectations, or perhaps the fear of not being able to take care of yourself? I'd like to explore this further with you. Let's take 10 minutes to talk about this, and I'll ask you some questions that might help you gain some clarity.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try talking about it for a bit, but I’m skeptical — how is unpacking this fear actually going to stop me from spiraling? For me, “feeling useless” means I’m not needed, I become a burden, and after the health scare I’m terrified of losing the routine and independence school gives me. I worry about disappointing my family, losing any sense of purpose, and just drifting without anything that feels like mine beyond assignments. I can do 10 minutes if you keep it concrete — one question at a time — and at the end give me a real, time‑limited thing to try (nothing fluffy) that I can tolerate, otherwise I’ll check out.

Therapist: I want to acknowledge that it's completely understandable to feel this way, given your recent health scare and the importance of your studies. It sounds like feeling useful and independent is a crucial aspect of your identity.

Let's take a minute to clarify: what would you say is the most important thing to you right now, in terms of feeling useful and independent? Is it being able to take care of yourself, completing your studies, or something else? 

(Note: We're taking a concrete question, not another exercise. The goal is to help you clarify your values and priorities, which will inform the next step.)

Patient: Honestly, the most important thing right now is being able to take care of myself and keep my independence — not feeling like a burden. Finishing my studies matters because it’s the clearest way I have to feel useful and keep a routine, but underneath that I’m terrified of disappointing people and just drifting. How is naming that supposed to help me, though?

Therapist: I'm glad we can clarify what's most important to you. Now, I'd like to offer you a specific, concrete action that can help you start to build a sense of control and independence. I want you to make a list of 5 small, daily activities that you can do for yourself, even on days when you're not feeling up to studying or keeping up with your routine. These can be as simple as taking a warm bath, reading a chapter in a book, or going for a short walk. What I want you to do is write down these 5 activities and commit to doing one of them today, for just 10 minutes. No need to think about the long-term benefits or consequences; just the immediate experience. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I'll try, but I really don’t expect this to fix anything. I'll write five small things: make tea and sit by the window for 10 minutes, take a 10‑minute walk around the block, make a simple snack and eat it without studying, water my plants/tend to something in the apartment, and tidy one small area of my desk for 10 minutes. I’ll do the walk today and report back, but honestly — how is this supposed to help me feel less stuck beyond just distracting myself?

Therapist: I'm glad you wrote down your list of small actions. Remember, these actions aren't meant to distract you from your studies, but rather to help you build a sense of control and autonomy. One thing to consider is that even small actions can be a form of self-care and self-compassion. What if, instead of viewing these actions as a way to escape or avoid your anxiety, you saw them as a way to take care of yourself and show yourself kindness? 

Let's try something new. I want you to think about the smallest, most mundane task you can think of, something that you do every day without even thinking about it, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Can you think of something like that?

Patient: Yeah — brushing my teeth. It's the one thing I do every morning without thinking. I can try doing it slowly and actually noticing the taste, the brush on my gums, the sound, but honestly — how is paying attention to brushing my teeth supposed to help me figure out what matters? Still, I guess I can try it now for a minute and see if it feels any different.

Therapist: I want you to keep brushing your teeth for another minute, and this time, I want you to pay attention to the sensation of your teeth being clean, the feeling of the water on your skin, and the sound of the water running. As you brush, bring to mind the value of taking care of yourself and your body. What does that feel like to you? 

After you're done, I want you to notice what happens in your body. Do you feel any shift, any change, or is it still just the usual routine?

Patient: Okay — I did it. Brushing slowly actually made the mint taste stronger and my jaw unclench for a few seconds, and for that moment my head wasn't full of deadlines. But it felt fleeting and sort of performative — the racing thoughts came back quick. What's a concrete next step I can try that actually builds something more than a tiny pause?

Therapist: I'm glad you noticed the fleeting moment of calm. That's a great sign that you're becoming more aware of your experiences. I want you to try something that builds on that pause. Can you think of one area in your apartment where you feel like you can make a small change or improvement, something that's not too overwhelming, but still meaningful to you? It could be as simple as rearranging a book on your shelf or straightening up your workspace. What would it take for you to start making a small change in that area, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is straightening a shelf supposed to help with feeling directionless? If I have to pick somewhere, it's my desk corner: piles of notes, an old mug, and my laptop shoved to one side. I could set a 10‑minute timer, clear the surface, file or toss loose papers, and put a small plant or a photo back there. I'll try that, but honestly I don’t expect it to fix anything long‑term — what exactly do you think that change will do for me?

Therapist: I think the change you're considering making to your desk corner is a great example of taking small, meaningful action. By clearing the surface, you're creating a sense of control and order in one area of your life, which can be a powerful act of self-care. What's interesting is that this action might not necessarily "fix" your feelings of directionlessness, but it can help you feel more grounded and capable. In a way, it's a small act of defiance against the overwhelm and uncertainty. Would you like to explore what values are at play here for you – what does it mean to have a sense of control and order in your life?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — what do you mean by "values" here? If I try to put it into words, control and order for me means not feeling chaotic, being able to take care of myself, and proving I'm not a burden; clearing my desk feels like reclaiming a tiny corner of competence. But how exactly is knowing that supposed to help me figure out what matters beyond school? I've done values worksheets before and they felt vague — I need something concrete that actually connects this to steps I can tolerate.

Therapist: I think you're close to articulating what matters to you. Instead of exploring values in a abstract way, let's try to connect it to a specific action. What if, instead of just clearing your desk, you also make a small commitment to yourself to take care of your physical needs for the rest of the day? Would you like to write that down – e.g., "I will drink two glasses of water, eat a healthy snack, and take a short walk outside before checking my phone again"?

Patient: I...okay, I can try to write that down, but right now I'm really jumpy and can't seem to focus — my chest tightened the moment you asked. I can commit to drinking two glasses of water and having a snack, and maybe a very short 5‑minute walk rather than anything longer. But honestly — how is this supposed to do more than distract me for a bit? If we're doing this, tell me something concrete I can do right now to anchor myself so I can actually write it down.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to commit to the small action. To help you stay focused, I want you to take a few deep breaths, feel the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. When you're ready, take one more deep breath, and say to yourself, "I am here, I am present, and I can take care of myself." Repeat this phrase to yourself for 10 seconds. When you're ready, we'll write down your commitment to drinking water, eating a snack, and taking a short walk.

Patient: Okay — I did the breaths and repeated the phrase, but I'm still really jumpy and my chest feels tight; I don't feel very anchored. I'll write down the commitments: drink two glasses of water, eat a small snack (like a banana and yogurt), and take a 5‑minute walk — but honestly, how is that supposed to do more than distract me?

I need something concrete to do right now so I don't fidget. Can you give me a single, exact instruction to follow for two minutes (for example: "Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste" or "take one slow, deliberate sip of water and notice each sensation")? If you tell me one thing, I'll do it — but no vague stuff.

Therapist: Here's a simple instruction for you to follow for the next 2 minutes: "Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground and the sensation of the chair beneath you. Every 30 seconds, take a slow, deliberate breath and notice how your body feels in that moment. When you're ready, we'll check in and see how you're doing."

Patient: I did it for the two minutes — I noticed my feet, felt the chair, took the slow breaths every 30 seconds. For a moment my chest loosened and my hands stopped fidgeting, but then the voice came back and I started getting restless again. I'm not sure I follow how this leads to anything practical — it feels like a tiny pause, not something that actually builds direction. If we're doing something next, give me one single, exact, non‑vague instruction I can do for five minutes right now that actually produces something tangible (set a timer, clear the top of my desk, whatever) — and tell me exactly how to start.

Therapist: Here's a single, exact instruction for you to follow for the next 5 minutes: "Clear the top of your desk by picking up the 5 items on your desk that are out of place and putting them away in their designated spot. When you're done, take a moment to notice how you feel and write down one thing you're proud of accomplishing."

Patient: Alright — I'll do it. I'm setting a 5‑minute timer now and I'm still skeptical this will do more than a tiny bandage, but I'll pick up the five out‑of‑place things and put them away, then write one thing I'm proud of. I'll report back when the timer's done.

Therapist: Please report back when the timer goes off, and we'll review your experience. As you put away the items on your desk, pay attention to how it feels to take control of a small task. When you're done, take a moment to notice how you feel physically and emotionally. What do you write down as one thing you're proud of accomplishing?

Patient: I did it — I put away the five out‑of‑place items (mug, loose papers, a pen pile, a stack of old notes, and a tangled charger) and wiped the top so it looks cleaner. I wrote down that I’m proud I actually followed through and made the space less chaotic — my chest eased a little for a moment, but the critical voice is still nagging. Okay, fine — that felt mildly useful, but how is this supposed to scale into anything real? Give me one exact, non‑fluffy next task I can do for 20 minutes right now that builds on this, and tell me exactly how to start.

Therapist: Here's a single, exact instruction for you to follow for the next 20 minutes: "Take out your old notes from the stack and review them, focusing on one topic or question that's been on your mind. Write down one thing you learned or one insight that resonates with you. Take your time, and when you're done, notice how you feel and write down one thing you're willing to take on next, even if it feels daunting."

Patient: Okay — I'll do it, though I'm skeptical this won't just feel like busywork. I'm setting a 20‑minute timer now. I'll pull out the stack and focus on notes from that creative writing class (it used to feel alive for me), review them, and write one insight on a sticky note plus one small next step I can actually try. Starting now — I'll report back when the timer goes off.

Therapist: Please report back when the timer goes off. As you review your notes and write down your insights, pay attention to what sparks your interest and what feels meaningful to you. When you're done, take a moment to notice how you feel and share your small next step with me. Remember, it's not about finding the answer or solving a problem, but about exploring and learning.

Patient: I did it — I pulled out the creative writing notes and read through pieces from that class. I wrote one sticky-note insight: "Writing lets me step outside the panic and notice patterns instead of getting swallowed by deadlines." It actually felt a little alive and my chest loosened for a bit, though I'm worried that's just fleeting. My small next step: tomorrow I'll set a 15‑minute timer and write a 250‑word scene, save it, and that’s it — no editing, just producing something concrete. But honestly — how is doing that supposed to actually help me figure out what matters beyond school?

Therapist: I'm glad to see that you're willing to take action on your creative spark. Your insight about writing being a way to step outside of panic and notice patterns is powerful. I'd like to ask: what do you think is the value of creating something concrete, like a 250-word scene, for you? What does that represent, and how might it help you start to clarify what matters beyond school?

Patient: I think making something concrete feels like proof I’m more than coursework — it’s something I chose to do that isn’t graded, and for a bit it reminds me I can create and feel alive. It also gives me a way to notice patterns instead of getting swallowed by deadlines, like you said. But honestly, I’m worried it’ll just be a fleeting lift — how is doing that a few times supposed to turn into anything real long‑term? If we’re treating this like an experiment, tell me one concrete way to make it stick so it doesn’t just fizzle out.

Therapist: I think it's great that you're worried about making this experience last. One way to make it stick is to make it a ritual. I want you to commit to making a new piece of creative writing a weekly habit, not just a one-time thing. Set a specific day and time each week, say it out loud, and write it down. For example, "Every Sunday at 7pm, I will write a 250-word scene for 15 minutes." This can help you build a sense of structure and consistency, which can make the experience feel more meaningful and lasting.

Patient: Okay — I can try that: Sunday 7–7:15pm, 250 words, timer on, save to a “writing” folder, phone in the other room, sticky note on my desk. But honestly I’m skeptical it’ll stick when school or the panic hits — how is this supposed to keep me from bailing? Tell me one concrete thing to make it harder to quit (should I tell a friend to check in, set a recurring calendar invite, promise myself a tiny reward?), and what do I do if I miss a week without spiraling into "I failed"?

Therapist: I think it's great that you're thinking about external accountability. One way to make it harder to quit is to share your commitment with someone you trust, such as a friend or family member. You can ask them to check in with you on Sundays at 7:15pm to see how your writing went and if you're feeling okay. This can provide an added sense of responsibility and motivation. Additionally, I want you to write down one thing you're willing to be kind to yourself if you miss a week, such as "I'm not a failure, I'm just having a tough week" or "I'll try again next Sunday." This can help you practice self-compassion and reframe any perceived failures.

Patient: Okay — I can try that. I'll tell my friend Maya to check in at 7:15pm on Sundays and I’ll set a recurring calendar invite and put my phone in the other room during the slot. My self‑compassion line will be: "Missing one week doesn't mean I'm a failure — I'll try again next Sunday." 

But honestly, how is telling a friend and a sticky note supposed to stop me from bailing when panic hits? What if Maya doesn't respond or I feel embarrassed — can you give me the exact short message to send her so it doesn't sound needy, and one concrete thing to do in the hour after a missed session so I don't spiral?
