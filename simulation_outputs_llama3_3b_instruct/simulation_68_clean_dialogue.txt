Patient: I'm an introverted, analytical software developer in my forties and after a difficult breakup I've been feeling stuck and directionless — like nothing matters beyond my job. I keep replaying things and can't figure out what I want next, and it's wearing me down. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried talking and self-help before and it didn't change much, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: I appreciate your honesty about previous experiences with self-help and therapy. Can you tell me what, if anything, is holding you back from taking a step towards exploring new possibilities, even if it's just a tiny one, like trying a new hobby or talking to someone new?

Patient: Mostly it's a mix of apathy and this sense that my identity is just “software developer,” so trying a hobby feels hollow and performative. I'm tired — emotionally and physically — and scared of failing or ending up more alone, and honestly I've tried the "start small" thing before, so how is that supposed to help when it doesn't stick? I guess I worry it'll just be another thing I quit and make me feel worse.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that any attempt to explore new things will feel like a failure or a repeat of past experiences. Can you think of one value that's important to you, something that gives you a sense of meaning or purpose?

Patient: I guess competence — doing good, clean work and solving problems — still matters to me; it's one thing I can usually rely on. It feels narrow, but it gives me a bit of purpose when everything else feels fuzzy. But seriously, how is that supposed to help me figure out anything beyond being a developer?

Therapist: So, competence is an important value for you, and it's interesting that you mention it might feel narrow. Can you think of what would happen if you were to start exploring something that didn't necessarily relate to your coding skills, but still allowed you to feel competent and useful? For example, would that mean you'd be trying to do something new, even if it's not directly related to your work?

Patient: Maybe — in theory — I'd try something that still lets me solve problems, like woodworking, fixing stuff around the house, or mentoring a junior dev outside of work. I can see how that might give a hit of competence, but I've tried new things before and they fade; I'm worried it'll just feel temporary or like another thing I give up on. How is that supposed to help when I'm this exhausted and my identity feels glued to being a developer?

Therapist: It's like you're looking for a way to keep your sense of competence intact, but you're not sure where to find it. Can you imagine that it's possible to be competent in ways that aren't necessarily tied to your professional life, but still align with your value of competence?

Patient: Yeah, I can imagine being competent at other stuff — like woodworking, fixing things, or mentoring — but it still feels abstract. At work I can measure progress; outside it feels vague and temporary, and I'm just tired of trying things that fizzle. How is that supposed to help me actually do it, rather than just thinking about it?

Therapist: Can you think of one specific instance where you've been able to show competence in a non-professional area, like fixing something with your own hands or helping someone else? What happened, and what did you feel in that moment?

Patient: Yeah — a few months ago I rebuilt a bookcase that had collapsed. I measured, cut, sanded, and put it back together so it wouldn’t wobble, and for a little while I felt actually capable and... quietly proud, like I’d solved a real, tangible problem. But that feeling faded pretty quickly and didn’t change much else, so honestly — how is that supposed to help me figure out what comes after being just a developer?

Therapist: So, it sounds like the sense of competence you felt after rebuilding the bookcase was satisfying, but it didn't lead to a lasting sense of fulfillment. What do you think is the difference between the feeling of competence you experienced then, and the sense of purpose or meaning you're looking for now?

Patient: The competence from the bookcase was immediate and concrete — I did a task, saw the result, and felt a small, tidy satisfaction. Purpose feels bigger and messier: it’s about long-term direction, things that connect to who I am and who I want to be, not just a one-off win. I get that difference in theory, but honestly I don’t see how translating those small hits of competence into something that actually shifts my identity or gives me lasting meaning is supposed to happen — I’m tired and afraid of committing to something that’ll just fizzle.

Therapist: Can you observe the thoughts that come up for you when you think about purpose, like "I need to find something that gives me lasting meaning" or "I'm afraid of failing and ending up alone"? What would happen if you were to let go of the need for a specific outcome, and instead focused on the process of exploring and discovering what gives you purpose?

Patient: When I think about purpose I get stuck in a loop: "I need something lasting" and "what if it fizzles or I fail," and there's this quieter voice that says it's pointless to try. Letting go of a specific outcome might take some pressure off and let me experiment, but it also feels like a way to accept drifting, and I'm not sure that's better. I've tried focusing on the process before and it didn't stick — so how is that supposed to help me now when I'm this drained?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that letting go of the need for a specific outcome will lead to aimlessness. Can you think of one value that, even if you're not sure what it leads to, feels important to you, like a compass that could guide you towards something meaningful?

Patient: Maybe reliability — being someone people can count on. It feels a bit broader than just competence and could point toward mentoring or practical help, but honestly how is that supposed to help me actually find direction instead of just another abstract label? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a pause for a moment. I'd like to invite you to take a few deep breaths, and then I'd like you to notice, simply, the sensation of your feet on the ground. Can you feel your feet touching the floor? Notice the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you?

Patient: Okay — I took a few deep breaths. My feet feel grounded against the floor, a little numb from sitting too long, and my shoulders are tight but slightly looser. It helps a bit in the moment, but the loop of thoughts is still there — how is that supposed to help me actually find direction or stick with anything? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. I'd like you to notice, for just a few seconds, the sensation of someone you trust, like a family member or friend, standing next to you, without adding any thoughts or labels. Just notice their presence.

Patient: Okay — I tried that. I pictured my sister standing there and for a second it felt a little warmer at my shoulder and my chest loosened, but it evaporated quickly and my mind raced back to the same doubts. How is that supposed to help me actually figure out direction or stick with anything? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something small. Would you be willing to commit to just 2-3 minutes of doing something simple, like taking a short walk around the block, or doing one load of laundry, without any expectations or outcomes in mind?

Patient: Alright — I can try a 2–3 minute walk around the block, but I'm not optimistic it'll change anything long-term. How is that supposed to help me find direction or actually stick with things? Also, can we slow down — what exactly should I pay attention to while I'm out so it doesn't just feel pointless?

Therapist: Let's focus on the process of the walk. As you walk, I'd like you to pay attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sound of your footsteps, and the sensation of the air on your skin. When your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to these sensations without judgment. Don't try to achieve anything, just observe what's happening in the present moment.

Patient: I did the walk for about three minutes. I noticed my feet, the sound of my steps, and the air on my face — for a few breaths my shoulders unclenched and it felt less frantic, but my mind kept snapping back to the "what if it fizzles" loop. It helps in the moment, sure, but I'm skeptical it leads to anything lasting — how is that supposed to help me actually find direction or make this stick? Also, I'm starting to feel overwhelmed again, can we slow down and maybe unpack how these tiny practices add up into real change?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to reflect on what happened during the walk. What did you notice when your mind started to wander back to the "what if it fizzles" loop? Was there a particular thought or emotion that you noticed, and how did your body respond to it?

Patient: When my mind wandered the exact thought that kept looping was, "You'll quit and feel worse," and that pulled up a low, crawling dread and this hit of shame. My chest tightened, my breathing got shallow, my stomach felt knotted, and my hands were restless — I kept wanting to check my phone and my attention just scattered. I even caught myself speeding up like I was trying to outrun the thought, then feeling guilty for doing that. How is noticing this supposed to help me actually change it? I'm getting anxious again — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling anxious and guilty about your experience, but I want to gently point out that the anxiety and guilt are just thoughts, and the physical sensations are just sensations. Can you observe these thoughts and sensations without judgment, just as they are? Instead of trying to chase away the thought or trying to control the physical sensations, can you simply acknowledge them as they arise?

Patient: I can notice them — the dread, the tightness in my chest, the racing thoughts and this urge to fidget or check my phone — and I can name them for a few breaths without making them wrong. But it still feels like intellectualizing; the moment I label them the anxiety jumps up and I get more restless, so how is that supposed to actually calm me or stop the loop? I'm getting jittery and scattered right now — can we slow down and try something else, because just noticing isn't really cutting it for me.

Therapist: Let's try a mindfulness exercise that focuses on the breath. I'd like you to bring your attention to your breath, feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, and allow your gaze to gently soften. Can you start by simply paying attention to the sensation of your breath, without trying to change it or control it in any way?

Patient: Okay... I did a few breaths. They’re shallow and my chest still feels tight — I can follow the breath for a couple of breaths before that “you’ll quit and feel worse” thought snaps back in and my hands start wanting to fidget. It calms my shoulders a little, but honestly it just feels like a short pause, not a solution; how is that supposed to help long-term? Can we slow down and talk about something that might actually move the needle instead of more quick fixes?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and explore what's driving the thought "you'll quit and feel worse." What is it about that thought that feels so compelling to you? Is it the fear of failure, the fear of not being good enough, or something else?

Patient: I think it's both—the fear of failing and this quieter shame that if I quit it proves I'm not enough beyond being a developer. It feels like evidence I'll end up alone or unreliable, and when I think about it my chest tightens and my hands start fidgeting. But seriously, how is just naming this supposed to change it? This is getting heavy—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to reflect on what's driving this shame and fear of being alone or unreliable. What is it about being a developer that feels so tied to your sense of self-worth? Can you think of a value that, even if it's not directly related to being a developer, feels important to you and might help counteract this shame and fear?

Patient: Being a developer gives me clear, measurable wins, so my worth got tied to shipping fixes and solving problems — when that’s gone or stalls, I feel worthless. A value that feels like it could counter the shame is reliability — being someone people can count on through small, steady acts. Maybe if I focused on tiny, repeatable things that show up for others, it could slowly challenge the “not enough” story, but… how is that supposed to help when I’m drained and keep quitting? This is a lot to hold right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on this value of reliability. Can you imagine yourself doing one small, tangible act that shows up for someone else right now, even if it's just making a cup of coffee for someone, or sending a kind message to a friend? What would that look like, and how would it feel to do it without expectation of a specific outcome?

Patient: I could maybe send my sister a short message — something like, "Thinking of you, hope you're doing okay." Doing it without expecting a reply might give a tiny bit of warmth, like a small proof that I can show up, but it also makes my chest tighten thinking about being ignored. How is that supposed to help me actually find direction or make this stick long-term? Can we slow down a bit so I can decide whether to do it now or later?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to consider the message you'd like to send to your sister. What if, instead of focusing on the potential outcome of a response, you simply focus on the act of sending the message itself? What would it feel like to take a few moments to type out a kind message, without thinking about whether anyone will read it or respond?

Patient: I can imagine typing a short message — it feels small and a bit forced, but maybe it’s a quiet way to show up. My chest tightens just thinking about being ignored and my attention is scattered, so I don’t know if I can do it right this second. If I did send it, how is that supposed to help me figure out direction long-term? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and consider this message as a tiny spark, a small step towards showing up for someone else. Can you imagine what would happen if you simply sent the message, without expectation of a response or outcome? Would it be just a small, insignificant act, or would it give you a sense of relief or connection?

Patient: Maybe it's just a tiny relief — like a little proof I can still reach out, and for a minute my chest might loosen. But the worry about being ignored would probably snap back and I'd still be left asking whether it actually moves me toward anything real. How is that supposed to help me find direction long-term? I'm feeling wiped and jittery—can we slow down before I decide whether to send it?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to notice your body and emotions right now. Can you bring your attention to your physical sensations, like the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the rhythm of your breath? Notice how your body is responding to the anxiety and worry, and allow yourself to feel those sensations without judgment.

Patient: My feet are on the floor but a bit numb, shoulders tense, breath shallow — my chest feels tight and my stomach's knotted. My thoughts keep darting and I can't hold onto the sensations for long; it loosens a bit for a moment, then the loop snaps back. How is noticing this supposed to help me actually find direction? I'm feeling wiped and jittery — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you imagine yourself sending the message, even if you're not sure what the outcome will be? What would happen if you simply took that small action, without expecting a specific result? Would it feel like a tiny risk, or a tiny step towards showing up for yourself and others?

Patient: I can picture typing and sending it — it'd probably feel like a tiny risk and maybe give a brief loosening in my chest, like a small proof I can still reach out. But I'm drained and the worry about being ignored is loud, so I'm skeptical this actually moves me toward any real direction long-term — how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down so I can decide without feeling pushed?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to pause. Can you imagine yourself as someone who is genuinely curious about exploring new things and trying new experiences? What would that feel like, and what values might be driving that curiosity?

Patient: I can picture a cautious, quiet curiosity — more tinkering than a leap, driven by competence, reliability, and maybe a small wish to not be only "the developer." It feels slightly hopeful but also risky and foreign, and I'm jittery about whether it would stick or just fizzle — how is that supposed to actually help me change? Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and explore the value of competence that's driving your curiosity. What would happen if you were to combine your curiosity with a sense of competence, so that instead of trying to "figure it out" or "make it work," you were simply doing it because it's what you're good at and it's valuable to you?

Patient: Maybe that would look like small, methodical experiments — setting tiny, testable goals and getting little wins so I feel competent without expecting some big life overhaul. It sounds more doable, but I'm worn out and half convinced even that will fizzle, so how is that supposed to actually shift my sense of direction when I keep quitting? Can we slow down and pick one concrete, tiny first step I might realistically manage?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and simplify it even further. What's one tiny, tiny thing you could do in the next hour that aligns with this approach? For example, could you write down one tiny, specific idea for an experiment or test that combines your curiosity with competence, and then commit to doing just that one thing?

Patient: Alright — I can try one tiny thing: in the next hour I'll spend 15–20 minutes sketching a simple woodworking shelf (dimensions, 3 tools/materials), and if I have the energy I'll mark the cuts or make the first cut; if not, I'll just finish the sketch and list. I don't expect this to change everything, but it's a concrete, competence-aligned step I can probably manage — can we slow down a bit while I decide exactly how to start?
