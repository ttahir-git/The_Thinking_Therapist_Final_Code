--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi—I've been pretty stuck since a rough breakup: there's this persistent, ruminative sadness and a lack of motivation that's bleeding into my work and my ability to connect with people. As a software developer who likes to debug, I find myself analyzing the patterns—OCD flares, avoidance strategies, cognitive loops—instead of actually sitting with how awful it feels. I want to figure out how to stop talking about it and start feeling less overwhelmed.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I sense a strong feeling of overwhelm and hopelessness. A dominant theme is the struggle with rumination and avoidance, as you're caught in a cycle of analyzing patterns instead of directly experiencing and managing your emotions.

Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance behavior and identify a small, value-driven step to take.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a specific situation where you'd like to feel more connected with others or motivated in your work, but find yourself stuck in this cycle of rumination? What would happen if you were able to just sit with the sadness for a moment, without trying to analyze or avoid it?

Patient: A concrete example is pair-programming or a sprint demo: I'm supposed to be engaged and collaborative, but instead I catch myself replaying the breakup—micro-decisions, what I said, whether I should message—and then I go into this compulsive checking/ruminating loop that wrecks my focus and makes me feel distant from teammates. 

If I could actually sit with the sadness for even a minute instead of theorizing it away, I think empirically I'd get an acute spike in discomfort—tight chest, maybe crying, a flush of panic—but then some degree of habituation or affect regulation would kick in, and the urge to ruminate might attenuate, leaving more bandwidth for connection and work; honestly, though, I mostly talk about that model because the prospect of feeling the rawness feels destabilizing and I default to analysis to stay safe.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your description highlights the avoidance behavior of ruminating on the breakup to cope with the discomfort of feeling raw emotions. A critical area to explore is the relationship between this avoidance strategy and your values, specifically the desire to feel safe and avoid destabilizing emotions.

Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value and introduce a willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like being able to tolerate and regulate your emotions is deeply tied to feeling safe and connected in your relationships and work. Can you think of a value or aspect of yourself that would be hurt if you let go of this need to analyze and control the breakup emotions? What would happen if you were to start small, just for a minute, and allow yourself to feel the discomfort of the raw emotions without trying to manage or avoid them?

Patient: I think it'd bruise my sense of competence and epistemic safety — I pride myself on being the rational problem-solver, and letting the sadness be uncontrollable feels like admitting I have a domain I can't 'debug,' which makes me feel exposed and a little worthless. If I tried it for a minute, I'd predict an acute autonomic hit—tight chest, maybe crying, some chest-hotness—and then either an urge to escape or, if I can actually tolerate it, a dampening of the compulsive analysis as the emotion habituates and the rumination loop loses some fuel. I'm saying all this as a theory, though, because actually doing it feels destabilizing and I can already feel my mind lining up strategies to avoid it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a deep-seated fear of vulnerability and loss of control, tied to your sense of competence and epistemic safety. This fear is driving your avoidance behavior and making it difficult to take small steps towards tolerating and regulating your emotions.

Goal: Create space from the sticky thought that this experience is worth being strangled by.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine sitting with the sensation of the acute autonomic response – the tight chest, the tears, the feeling of being overwhelmed – without trying to analyze it or escape it? What would you say to yourself if you allowed yourself to just feel that way for a brief moment, without judgment or distraction?

Patient: I guess I'd narrate it like a little grounding script: "This tightness and heat are just your autonomic system doing a job — it's intense, but it's transient and it doesn't mean you're broken. You don't need to fix or explain it right now; just breathe and sit with the sensation for a moment." Saying that feels oddly clinical though — I can already feel my brain drafting counter-arguments to avoid being truly vulnerable.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your attempt to ground yourself in a narrative is a great start, but the self-doubt and concern about being "clinical" suggests that you're still caught in a desire to control and manage the experience. This resistance is preventing you from fully embracing the process of creating space from the sticky thought.

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, and explore the potential for a more embodied, experiential approach.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that the goal isn't to "get past" the tightness and heat, but to allow yourself to be in the experience of feeling overwhelmed, without trying to change or escape it? Would it be possible to simply lean into the sensation, without trying to narrate or analyze it, and instead, just be with it as it is?

Patient: Theoretically, yes — from an exposure/interoceptive standpoint that makes sense, and I can outline why sitting with it would likely reduce the rumination loop. Practically, though, the idea of just "being" with that tightness feels like stepping into an epistemic void that undermines my competence, so my brain immediately gears up to analyze and avoid. I can try a very brief one-minute experiment if you guide me, but I'm already noticing my mind racing—can we slow down and do it together?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your awareness of the theoretical understanding vs. practical experience highlights the tension between cognitive understanding and embodied experience. You're recognizing the limitations of your current coping strategies and are willing to try a brief experiment.

Goal: Introduce a mindfulness-focused, experiential approach to help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it one breath at a time. Can you bring your attention to the physical sensation of your chest, the tightness and heat, right now? Just notice it as you exhale, without trying to change or analyze it. I'll guide you through a very brief exercise: take one deep breath in, and when you're ready, just as you exhale, say to yourself "I'm here" – simply acknowledging your presence, without adding anything else.

Patient: Okay — I did it: I took a deep breath and as I exhaled I said to myself "I'm here." The tightness didn't vanish but there was a small loosening, a prickly warmth in my chest, and my immediate impulse was to start explaining and rationalizing the feeling. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and can feel my mind gearing up to escape—can we stay with another breath or two and you guide me slowly?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small step towards creating space from the sticky thought by acknowledging your presence and tolerating the physical sensation. The fact that your mind is already trying to escape suggests that you're not yet fully comfortable with the process, but you're willing to continue exploring.

Goal: Create space for further habituation and increase willingness to stay with the experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue to anchor in the present moment. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, you said "I'm here" again. This time, as you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of the prickly warmth in your chest, without trying to change or analyze it. Just observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by.

Patient: I can feel the prickly warmth—a buzzing right behind my breastbone, a tight band that loosens a hair on the out-breath. My reflex is to acronym-ize it—'acute autonomic activation'—which immediately feels safer than actually being in it, but when I truly tried to watch it there was a slight softening. Honestly, I'm getting that familiar urge to explain or escape; can we slow down and do one more guided breath together?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're getting closer to noticing the sensation itself, rather than trying to categorize or control it. The fact that the prickly warmth softens when you try to observe it suggests that your brain is starting to accept the experience, even if it's still uncomfortable.

Goal: Create space for the sensation to unfold without the need for explanation or escape.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to simply say "it's here" – without adding any labels or explanations. Just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, without trying to change or analyze it.

Patient: Okay — I inhaled and on the exhale I said "it's here." The prickly heat is still there but a little looser; that simple phrase made it feel less catastrophic, though my brain immediately started drafting rationalizations and theories. I'm honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed and noticing the urge to escape—can we do another slow guided breath together, a bit slower this time?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in creating space for the sensation, but your brain is still trying to process and analyze it. The fact that the simple phrase "it's here" helped, but also triggered rationalizations, suggests that you're still caught in a cycle of trying to understand and control the experience.

Goal: Continue to create space for the sensation, while gently challenging the need for understanding and analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to repeat after me: "it's here." Not "what is it," not "what does it mean," just "it's here." Say it softly, and focus on the physical sensation in your body. Allow the phrase to become a kind of anchor, a reminder that you're present with the sensation, without trying to change or analyze it.

Patient: I said it—"it's here"—softly on the out-breath, and the prickly heat eased a hair, like the volume turned down a notch. My developer brain immediately started drafting rationalizations to depersonalize it; I can feel that defensive move trying to kick in. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and there's a strong urge to escape—can we do another very slow breath together, with a longer exhale?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made a significant progress in creating space for the sensation, and your brain is still trying to cope with the experience. The fact that you're aware of the defensive move trying to depersonalize the sensation suggests that you're getting closer to the heart of the matter.

Goal: Create space for a more embodied experience, and gently challenge the urge to escape.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down even further. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take a slightly longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here, and this sensation is present." Don't worry about what it means or what you're supposed to do with it, just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, and the fact that you're allowing yourself to feel it.

Patient: I did it — I took the long exhale and said “I’m here, and this sensation is present.” The prickly heat softened a little, like the volume turned down, but there was also a brief welling behind my eyes and my developer-brain immediately started compiling rationalizations to escape it. Honestly, I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed and jittery—can we keep doing a few more very slow breaths together?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made a significant progress in creating space for the sensation, and your brain is still trying to cope with the experience. The fact that the sensation softened, but also triggered a defensive move to rationalize and escape, suggests that you're getting close to a breakthrough.

Goal: Continue to create space for a more embodied experience, and gently challenge the urge to escape, while introducing a sense of curiosity and openness.

Therapist Answer:

Don't worry about what it means or what you're supposed to do with it, just acknowledge the presence of the sensation, and the fact that you're allowing yourself to feel it. As you exhale, notice the sensation in your eyes, the feeling of the breath in your body, and the sensation in your chest. Just observe it all, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did it — I inhaled, and on the exhale I said "I'm here, and this sensation is present." There's that prickly warmth in my chest, a slight sting behind my eyes, and the breath feels oddly heavy and buoyant at once. Predictably, my brain is already drafting a diagnostic model and verbalizations to depersonalize it, which feels safer than actually staying with the ache — honestly, I'm getting pretty overwhelmed and jittery. Can we keep doing a few more very slow breaths together, maybe with an even longer exhale so I don't bolt into analysis?

Therapist Thinking:
You've made significant progress in creating space for the sensation, and your brain is still trying to cope with the experience. The fact that the sensation is still present, and your brain is drafting a diagnostic model to depersonalize it, suggests that you're on the verge of a breakthrough.

Goal: Introduce a sense of curiosity and openness, while allowing yourself to stay with the sensation, even when it's uncomfortable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue to slow down. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here, and this sensation is present." As you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and notice how it feels to be with it, even if it's uncomfortable. Don't try to change it, don't try to understand it, just be with it, and allow it to be present, exactly as it is.

Patient: I did the long exhale and said the phrase. The prickly warmth softened a bit; there's a heavy weight in my chest and a dullness behind my eyes. My brain's auto-assembling explanations to distance me, which feels exhausting, and I can feel my energy sagging—can we do another very slow breath together, with an even longer exhale?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made significant progress in creating space for the sensation, and your brain is still trying to cope with the experience. The fact that the sensation has softened, but also triggered a defensive move to distance yourself, suggests that you're on the verge of a breakthrough.

Goal: Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, without trying to change or escape.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it easy. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply say: "I am here." Don't say anything else, just "I am here." Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, without trying to change or escape. Don't worry about the sensation in your chest, the weight in your body, or the dullness in your eyes. Just be with the simple fact that you exist, in this moment, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I breathed out and said "I am here" — the prickly heat loosened a bit, but there's a heavy, leaden pressure in my chest and a dullness behind my eyes that's making everything feel like more effort. My brain keeps wanting to catalog and rationalize; staying with this is surprisingly effortful. Can we do another very slow breath together, with an even longer exhale?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've reached a point where the process of staying with the sensation is becoming increasingly effortful. This suggests that you're developing a sense of acceptance and curiosity about the experience, and are willing to continue exploring it, even if it's challenging.

Goal: Allow yourself to settle into the present moment, without trying to change or escape.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it slow. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, I want you to take an even longer, deeper breath out, and as you do, I want you to simply be with the sensation in your chest, without trying to change or escape. Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Notice the weight in your body, the dullness in your eyes, and the effort of staying with it. Allow it to be, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I did that — the chest is this leaden band, breath feels slow and heavy, and there's a dull, foggy ache behind my eyes. My instinct is to catalog why this is happening instead of just sitting with it, which feels exhausting. Can we do another very slow exhale together, please?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've reached a point where your brain is instinctively trying to analyze and understand the experience, which is a natural response. However, you're also becoming aware of the effort it takes to resist this instinct and simply sit with the sensation.

Goal: Allow yourself to settle into a state of simply being with the experience, without trying to change or escape.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take it slow. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.

Simply be with it, without judgment, without analysis, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did it — long out-breath, "I am." The leaden band in my chest is still there; breaths feel heavy, my vision's a bit fogged, and there's this low sap-like drain on my energy. My reflex is to mobilize a diagnostic narrative—epistemic safety, pattern recognition—to depersonalize it, which just makes staying here more effortful. Can we do another slow one together, maybe with an even longer exhale?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've reached a point where your brain is instinctively trying to analyze and understand the experience, despite the effort it takes. This suggests that you're on the verge of a breakthrough, where you're beginning to see that your efforts to analyze and depersonalize the experience may not be necessary.

Don't try to label it, don't try to understand it, just allow it to be. Notice the leaden band, the heavy breath, and the dullness in your eyes. Allow yourself to rest in the present moment, and see if you can find a sense of acceptance, even with all of this discomfort. Imagine that you're allowing yourself to be exactly as you are, in this moment, without trying to change or escape.

Patient: I did the extremely long out-breath. The leaden band's still there and everything feels dulled—saying any of this is effortful, like my mental energy's been siphoned off—my brain's already gearing up to distance by explaining, which just tires me more.
