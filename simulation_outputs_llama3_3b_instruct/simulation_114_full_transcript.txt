--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in these cycles of harsh self-criticism—small mistakes spiral into narratives of total failure, especially since I started this demanding new program at work. I can theorize about the origins—growing up with inconsistent parenting taught me to preemptively blame myself to manage uncertainty—but it's harder to actually sit with the shame when it shows up. I tend to intellectualize my emotions and talk about mechanisms instead of feeling the sadness or fear, probably because that's safer.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes feeling stuck in cycles of harsh self-criticism and shame, particularly in relation to a new work program. Core emotion is shame. A specific theme or contradiction is the patient's tendency to intellectualize their emotions, using mechanisms to avoid feeling the underlying sadness and fear. 

Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of "stuck" to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
What specific mistakes or situations trigger these harsh self-criticisms and feelings of shame?

Patient: Usually it's small, concrete things—missing a deadline, fumbling through a case presentation, or forgetting an email—that trigger it; those slip-ups get quickly magnified into proof that I'm fundamentally incompetent. I tend to map it out in a causal chain—discrepancy, catastrophic inference, global self-labeling—which feels like a cognitive strategy I learned when parenting was unpredictable. I keep explaining it because naming the shame feels risky, but when it happens there’s this tightening in my chest and I just want to hide.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a pattern of catastrophizing and self-blame following small mistakes, which likely stems from a childhood experience of unpredictable parenting. The patient is aware of this pattern and acknowledges the risk of shame but struggles to feel and acknowledge the emotions directly.

Goal: Explore the tangible aspects of "stuck" to identify potential areas for committed action later.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring to mind a recent situation where you felt this tightening in your chest, right before you wanted to hide? What would it be like to pause for just a moment, before reacting to this feeling, and simply observe it as a physical sensation in your body, without judgment?

Patient: Yeah—last week in a supervision meeting I tripped over a case summary and someone asked a follow-up question I hadn't prepped for. In that moment there was a tight band across my chest, my breathing got shallow and fast, my stomach went cold and queasy, and my hands felt tingly like I wanted to disappear. I can label that as sympathetic arousal and tie it to my attachment history, but when you ask me to just observe it, I notice I immediately shift into analysis instead of staying with the raw sensation—it's difficult and a little frightening.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a specific situation where sympathetic arousal triggered a strong physical response, likely linked to an attachment history. The patient recognizes the physical sensations but struggles to stay with them, instead shifting into analysis mode.

Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy.

Therapist Answer:
Your tendency to shift into analysis when trying to observe the raw sensation might be helpful in some ways, but it can also prevent you from truly feeling and addressing the underlying distress. What would happen if you were to intentionally allow the physical sensations to stay with you for just a moment, without trying to analyze or label them, but instead simply noticing them as present in your body?

Patient: If I actually tried to let the sensations be, I'd notice the tight band in my chest and the shallow breath and then my mind would immediately forklift into a meta-analysis about why I'm feeling that way—so the feeling gets neutralized by explanation. In theory, staying with it could let the intensity crest and pass and weaken the automatic "I'm a failure" story, but in practice that feels like stepping off a cliff; the urge to analyze is a safety behavior that keeps me from feeling exposed. I'm willing to try something small—maybe just count my breaths for thirty seconds and internally name the tightness—but I'm already anxious about it, so can we go slower?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient recognizes that trying to let go of analysis might lead to increased anxiety, which is understandable given the fear of feeling exposed. The patient is willing to try a small, incremental step, but wants to approach it more slowly.

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
That makes sense. It's like you're trying to step off a cliff, but you're holding onto the safety rope. Before we try counting breaths, I want to check in with you about this anxiety. What's the worst that could happen if you were to just notice the tightness for 30 seconds without analyzing it?

Patient: Honestly, I'm afraid it would snowball—what starts as tightness could swell into a flush of shame or a panic wave and I'd start crying or go quiet, and I'd feel unbearably small. My immediate fear is that people, especially my supervisor, would read that as evidence I'm incompetent, which would then fuel days of rumination and withdrawal. Part of me frames it as a predictable activation of attachment and threat circuitry, but underneath that I'm just scared of feeling exposed and losing control. I don't want to be dramatic, but that vulnerability feels risky in a way that makes me want to retreat into analysis.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's fear of vulnerability and exposure is deeply rooted, with a strong association with shame and feelings of incompetence. The patient is aware of the attachment and threat circuitry, but also recognizes a deeper fear of losing control.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like there's a lot of emotional weight attached to this idea of being exposed. Can you try to acknowledge the feeling of vulnerability without judgment, without having to make it a story about you being incompetent or shameful? Instead, can you allow it to be simply a sensation, like the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: Alright—I'll try. Right now I notice a dull pressure under my sternum, my breath shallow and quick, and a sort of cold hollow in my stomach if I don't put a story on it. The instant I try to stay with that, my mind drafts a narrative—"this is proof you messed up"—and the sensation gets folded into shame. Can we go slower? Maybe you could guide me through a very brief grounding for 20 seconds so I don't immediately bail into analysis.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in noticing the physical sensations without judgment, but is still prone to immediately drafting a narrative that leads to shame. The patient is willing to try a brief grounding exercise to increase the window of tolerance.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very brief grounding exercise. I'd like you to focus on the sensation in your feet, wherever they are on the ground. Just notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the weight of your body distributed on them, without trying to analyze or label it. Can you simply bring your attention to your feet, 5... 4... 3...

Patient: Okay—I'm trying. I can feel the heels and balls of my feet pressing into the floor, a dull warmth and a mild tingling, like a tiny anchor, and my breath feels a bit steadier. But my mind already drafts a metanarrative—"this is just a coping mechanism"—and I can feel the urge to explain instead of stay; can you keep counting slowly for another ten seconds so I don't bail?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty defusing the narrative, as the mind tends to draft a metanarrative even while attempting to focus on the physical sensations. The patient is aware of the urge to explain, but is resisting it to some extent.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion).

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue counting together: 2... 1... 0... Now, I'd like to ask: What would happen to the sensation in your feet if you were to simply let go of the need to analyze or label it? What would happen if you just allowed it to be there, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: Intellectually, models of interoception and acceptance would say the sensation would just sit there and likely decrease if I stopped narrating it. When I actually try, my feet do feel steadier—pressure at the heels and balls, a low, warm anchoring—and it doesn't cascade into panic; it's more like a quiet baseline. But my mind immediately medicalizes that calm as fragile and starts inventing doom scenarios, so I'm nervous about trusting it—can we stay with this another 30 seconds so I don't bail into analysis?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to momentarily experience a sense of calm and stability with their grounding exercise, but their mind quickly attempts to undermine this by medicalizing it and inventing doom scenarios. The patient is hesitant to trust this experience and is concerned about falling back into analysis.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue to explore this experience. Can you imagine that the calm, steady feeling in your feet is not a fragile state that will suddenly collapse, but rather a natural, present-moment experience? What would it be like to trust that this feeling is a reliable anchor, and to allow yourself to settle into it, without judgment or analysis?

Patient: Theoretically, I can see how framing the feet as an anchor would down-regulate threat responses—it makes sense in a cognitive-affective model—but when I actually try it I feel a warm, steady pressure under my heels and a slight buzzing in the balls of my feet that calms my breath. Almost immediately, though, a hot wash of shame and irritative frustration rises—my throat tightens, my face feels hot—and my mind starts drafting catastrophe scripts about what that calm means. Can we stay with the feet for a bit longer? I need more time before I let my head narrate it away.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty translating theoretical understanding into experiential application, as the calming effect of the grounding exercise is short-lived and quickly gives way to shame and frustration. The patient is seeking more time to solidify this experience.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and increase willingness to tolerate uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Let's stay with the feet for another 10 seconds, and this time, I'd like you to focus on the sensation in your feet, without trying to analyze it or label it. Can you simply notice the warm, steady pressure under your heels and the slight buzzing in the balls of your feet, without judgment or commentary? As you breathe, notice how your body feels, without trying to change it.

Patient: I can feel the warm steady pressure under my heels and that faint buzzing in the balls of my feet; my breathing's a little slower and there's a mild grounding. Almost immediately a hot wash of shame comes up—throat tight, face hot—and frustration too, like my mind wants to narrate and neutralize it with explanations (interoceptive avoidance, metacognitive circling). I can try to stay, but I'm nervous—could you keep counting slowly for another 20 seconds so I don't bail into analysis?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is able to temporarily maintain focus on the grounding sensation, but again, their mind quickly attempts to defend against the discomfort of shame and frustration by introducing explanations and narratives. The patient is aware of their nervousness and seeks additional support.

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue counting together: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way, and that you're not failing or weak for feeling shame and frustration. Would you be willing to simply allow these feelings to be present, without trying to analyze or change them, even if they feel uncomfortable?

Patient: I'll try — I'm willing in principle, but in practice when I attempt to "allow" the feelings I get slammed with a hot shame and this sharp frustration; my chest tightens and my mind immediately starts narrating to neutralize it. I can stay with it if you keep guiding me for another 20–30 seconds, but I need help reminding myself to drop into the sensations instead of explaining them away.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in being willing to tolerate the discomfort, but is struggling to actually experience it without narrative. The patient is seeking additional support and guidance to help them stay with the sensations.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and increase willingness to tolerate uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like to try something different. Instead of trying to "allow" the feelings, I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your chest tightening. Notice the sensation of the tightness, without trying to label it or analyze it. Instead, try to simply observe it, like you're watching a cloud pass by without judgment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, right now?

Patient: Alright—when I bring attention to my chest there's that tight, constricting band right under my sternum, my breath gets shallow, and my throat feels weirdly hot. Almost instantly a sour, shamey churn rises and with it a prickly irritation—I'm mad at myself for feeling small, so my brain starts whipping up theories to dodge the feeling. I can try to stay with it, but I'm afraid it'll swell into something overwhelming—could you keep guiding me for a bit so I don't slip back into analysis?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus on the physical sensations, and their mind quickly introduces shame, irritation, and theoretical explanations to defend against the discomfort. The patient is aware of their fear of the feelings overwhelming them and seeks continued guidance.

Therapist Answer:
Let's continue to focus on the sensation in your chest. I'd like you to try to notice the sensation without trying to change it or label it. Imagine that you're holding a small, delicate vase in your hands, and the sensation in your chest is like a tiny, annoying buzzing in the vase. What would happen if you were to simply watch the buzzing, without trying to fix it or get rid of it?

Patient: Conceptually, if I just watched the buzzing it should habituate—like exposure theory says the intensity will crest and then subside. But in practice it surges into a hot wash of shame and irritative anger—my chest tightens, my face flushes, and my brain immediately reaches for explanations to smother it; can you keep guiding me through another 20–30 seconds so I don't bail into analysis?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is aware of the theoretical concept of habituation, but struggles to apply it in practice, as their mind quickly introduces shame and explanations to defend against the discomfort. The patient is seeking continued support to maintain focus on the sensations.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and increase willingness to tolerate uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to focus on the sensation in your chest again. I'd like you to imagine that the sensation is like a small, repetitive noise, like a ticking clock. Notice the sound, the sensation of the ticking, without trying to change it or analyze it. What if, instead of trying to get rid of the noise, you simply allowed it to be there, without judgment, without trying to fix it?

Patient: When I try to "just let it tick," the ticking actually seems to amplify and a hot shame washes over me—I'm suddenly irritated and furious at myself, like I'm failing all over again. I can talk about habituation and decentering all day, but my reflex is to turn it into evidence of incompetence, which pulls me straight back into analysis. Can you keep guiding me for another 20–30 seconds? If you stop, I'll probably bail into explanation, and I want to try staying but I'm scared it'll spiral.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:

The patient is aware of the danger of getting pulled back into analysis and is seeking continued support to maintain the temporary progress.

Goal: Create space from a sticky thought (defusion) and increase willingness to tolerate uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not going anywhere. Let's try to pause for just a moment, and I'll speak in a very calm and gentle tone. Can you look at me, just for a brief moment, and say to me, "I am here with you, and I'm supporting you, and I'm not going anywhere"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try: "I am here with you, and I'm supporting you, and I'm not going anywhere." Saying that out loud brings up a hot flush of shame and irritation, like my chest tightens and my brain immediately wants to narrate and explain it away with metacognitive theories instead of actually trusting it. Can you keep holding that steady while I... try to stay with the feeling instead of bailing into analysis?

Therapist Answer:
I'm still here, holding the space for you. Let's try to focus on the sensation in your chest, just for a moment. I'm not asking you to do anything, just to notice it, without trying to change it or label it. Can you imagine that you're holding a small, delicate leaf in your hand, and the sensation in your chest is like the gentle rustle of the leaf in the wind?

Patient: I'm trying to picture the leaf—there's a faint flutter in my chest, my breath eases a touch, and it could be gentle if I let it. Almost immediately a hot shame spikes and a sharp frustration follows—my mind shoots into self-blame and then hides behind analysis, calling it interoceptive avoidance so I don't have to feel small. I don't want to bail into explaining it away; can you keep holding the space a little longer while I try to stay with the rustle instead of narrating it?

Can you notice the sensation of the air moving past your skin, without trying to change it or label it as "shame" or "fear"?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to feel the air on my skin; there's a cool filament along my forearms and a tiny loosening under my ribs, like a softer version of that chest band. Almost immediately a hot, searing shame slams into me and I get prickly and irritable—my brain launches into metacognitive maneuvers (interoceptive avoidance, narrative formation) to explain it away. I want to stay with the breeze but I'm scared it'll unmask me, so could you keep guiding or gently count me through another 20 seconds so I don't bail into analysis?
