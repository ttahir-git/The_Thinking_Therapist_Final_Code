Patient: I'm an older business owner and lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because my anxiety spikes in social settings. After a health scare, my mind just goes into this fortune-telling mode — I picture myself saying something wrong, everyone thinking I'm unwell or ridiculous, gossip ruining my reputation and, inevitably, my business collapsing. I mostly rely on myself and it feels like if I try to go out, that chain of disasters will definitely happen.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's important to you in life, something that would make you feel valued, respected, or happy?

Patient: I want to feel respected and useful — my family, my business, and a few steady friends matter to me. But my head immediately spins a worst-case story: if I try to be seen, I'll say something odd, they'll laugh or whisper, clients will hear, and everything I've built will come crashing down. I know that sounds extreme, but I get stuck on that chain of events and it feels more real than the idea of being welcomed.

Therapist: What would be the smallest, most low-stakes step you could take this week to be seen and heard by someone you trust, without feeling like you're risking everything?

Patient: I guess the smallest step would be to send a short text to one trusted friend, something like "thinking of you" or "want to grab coffee"—but my mind immediately goes: they'll read it the wrong way, start worrying, tell others, a client hears, the gossip spreads, and my reputation and business end up ruined. I know that's probably overblown, but I can't shake that chain of disasters.

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath and notice what's happening in your body right now, without judgment? Where do you feel the tension or anxiety?

Patient: Okay — I breathed in like you asked. My chest feels tight, like a weight pressing down, my stomach's knotted, my hands are a little tingly, and my throat's dry so I keep swallowing. Even noticing it doesn't help; as soon as my heart quickens my mind launches into the disaster story — I'll say the wrong thing, everyone will stare, gossip will spread, and it'll ruin everything. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by how fast the stories take over; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like your physical sensations are a signal that you're feeling overwhelmed, but they're being linked to the catastrophic narrative. Let's pause the story for a moment. Can you describe what would need to happen in this worst-case scenario for your physical sensations to start feeling better, like your chest relaxing and your stomach unwinding?

Patient: If this nightmare played out, nothing small would make my chest loosen — I'd only start to feel better once the whispers stopped and my name wasn't smeared anymore. That would mean someone publicly correcting the gossip, my regular clients coming back and saying they trust me, and several months of steady business numbers proving I wasn't ruined. I know that sounds extreme, but anything less feels useless, and I'm already getting overwhelmed by thinking about how long that would take — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on the present moment, not the future or the hypothetical scenario. Can you bring your attention to your breath, focusing on the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without judgment? As you focus on your breath, I'll guide you through a simple exercise to help you break the connection between your physical sensations and the catastrophic thoughts.

Patient: I'm trying to follow the breath — when I slow it my chest loosens a bit and the knot in my stomach eases for a moment, but then my mind jumps in: if I relax I'll say something strange, they'll whisper, clients will hear, and everything falls apart. So the breathing helps a little, but it also feels like the calm gives the disaster room to start, and that's making me overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're walking on eggshells, trying to avoid any perceived misstep. What's the core of what's driving your desire to protect yourself and your business in this way? Is there a value or sense of self that you're trying to preserve or uphold?

Patient: I guess at the core I'm trying to protect my reputation, my independence, and the business that gives me purpose — if that goes, I feel like I lose everything that makes me respectable and secure. My mind immediately goes: one awkward comment, whispers start, clients pull out, creditors show up, I lose the business, my home, and my family's trust — that's how it always plays out in my head and it feels inevitable. I'm getting a bit shaky just saying it; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body, like your shakiness, without judgment. Now, I want to ask: What would it mean to you, for someone to have confidence in you and your abilities, despite this worst-case scenario?

Patient: If someone still had confidence in me, it would mean my reputation survived — they'd correct the gossip, clients would come back, and I'd prove I wasn't ruined. But my mind immediately screams that's impossible: one defender won't stop the whispers, contracts will be pulled, creditors will call, and before long I'll lose the business and my home. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by how fast I jump to that ending — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you imagine a moment, just a tiny moment, where you have the confidence to be yourself in a social situation, without the thought of catastrophic consequences? What would that feel like, in your body?

Patient: If I could feel that tiny bit of confidence, my shoulders would drop, my breath would smooth, my voice might come out steady and my stomach would unclench for a moment. But my mind immediately yells that if I relax I'll blurt something stupid, they'll whisper, clients will hear and my business will be ruined — it's happening so fast in my head that I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny, tiny step. Imagine that in this moment, you're standing in a room with one person you trust, and you say something to them that feels kind of neutral, not necessarily positive, but not catastrophic either. Just something ordinary, like "I'm feeling a bit nervous about this situation." Would it be possible to hold that thought without the catastrophic spin?

Patient: I try, but I can't — the moment I think "I'm feeling a bit nervous" my mind instantly turns it into everyone staring, whispers turning into gossip, clients dropping, and my business collapsing. Maybe there's a half-second where my shoulders drop, but that story swallows it so fast I can't hold the neutral thought; I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on what you don't want (the catastrophic thinking), can you simply acknowledge the thought that just occurred, without judgment? Just notice it, like a fleeting cloud passing by. "The thought that just occurred was: 'I'm feeling a bit nervous.' Can you allow that thought to pass, without trying to change it or push it away?"

Patient: I can name it — "I'm feeling a bit nervous." I try to let it sit, but the second it shows up my head turns it into everyone noticing, whispering, clients pulling away, and my business collapsing, so it doesn't pass, it just gets louder. I'm starting to feel jittery and overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's start with a tiny, everyday action. Would you be willing to simply put your hands down on the table or on your lap, and stay there for just one breath, without doing anything else?

Patient: Okay — I can put my hands on my lap and try to stay for one breath. They're a bit shaky and the moment I pause my head launches the story: if I sit still they'll notice something's off, whisper, a client will hear, and my business will be ruined. I'm already getting overwhelmed by how fast it takes over; can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the physical sensation in your hands and body as you keep them on the table. What's happening in your body, and what might happen if, just for a moment, you let go of the catastrophic thinking about what others might notice?

Patient: My hands feel clammy and a bit shaky, my shoulders are up by my ears, and my chest is tight. If I let go even for a breath maybe my breathing would smooth and the knot in my stomach would ease — but my mind instantly says that calm will let the disaster start: I'll blurt something, people will whisper, clients will pull away, and everything I've built will collapse, so I can't really let go and I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the overwhelming feeling. Can you allow the sensation of being overwhelmed, the shakiness, and the tightness in your chest, without trying to change it or push it away? Notice that you're already doing this, just by being here, in this moment, with me.

Patient: I can try to let it be — my chest is tight, my hands are trembling, and my mind immediately turns that into the whole disaster: they'll notice, whisper, clients will hear, and everything falls apart. I can stay with this for a moment, but it's getting louder and I'm starting to feel really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for just one more moment, without trying to change anything. Can you simply stay with the sensation of your chest being tight, your hands trembling, and the thought of catastrophic consequences, without judgment, for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to stay with it for one breath. My chest is tight and my hands are trembling, but the moment I pause my mind is already screaming that they'll notice, gossip will spread, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. It's getting louder and I'm really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at your body. Can you notice where the trembling is most pronounced in your hands? Is it in the fingers, the wrists, or somewhere else? What happens when you look at that area of your body?

Patient: Mostly in my fingertips and wrists — they buzz and tremble like a small electric current. When I look at them I feel exposed and the whole disaster reel starts: they'll see my hands shaking, whisper that I'm falling apart, clients will hear and pull away, and my business will be finished. I'm feeling jumpier and more distracted than before; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on your fingertips and wrists for just a moment. Can you notice the sensation of your fingertips and wrists as they tremble, without trying to change it or push it away? Notice the buzzing, the feeling of exposure, and the thought that comes with it. Now, I want you to say to yourself, in a gentle tone, "This is happening now."

Patient: "This is happening now." I say it, but the buzz in my fingertips makes it feel like admitting it will set the whole chain in motion — they'll notice, whisper, clients will pull out, and my business will crumble. I'm getting jumpier and really distracted now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a step back and try a different approach. Can you imagine that the buzz in your fingertips is not a signal for the catastrophic thinking to start, but rather a neutral sensation, like the buzzing of a fly around you?

Patient: I can't really make it neutral — the moment my fingertips buzz my head flips the switch: they'll notice my hands, whisper, a client overhears, contracts get pulled, and the business collapses. I'm jumpier and more distracted than before; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you think of one thing that's important to you, something that would make you feel valued and respected, even if your hands do shake in front of others? What is that value?

Patient: Trust — that people see me as steady, reliable, someone they can count on. But the minute my hands shake or I seem nervous, my head says they'll think I'm falling apart, the whispers start, clients pull out, contracts vanish and my business is finished. I'm not sure I follow how naming that value helps — I'm jumpier and distracted just saying it, and I'm getting really overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a tiny step. Can you imagine yourself in a situation where you're meeting with a new client or a partner, and you notice that your hands are shaking a bit? What would it mean to you if they saw you as steady and reliable, despite the shakiness?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? If they saw me as steady despite my hands shaking, it would mean my reputation held up, but my head instantly spins: someone notices later, the whispers start, clients pull out, contracts get canceled, and the business collapses. I'm jumpier and more distracted now—my heart's racing and it's all racing through my mind; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to look at your hands again. What would it mean to you, fundamentally, that you are a capable and reliable person, regardless of how your hands are shaking?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Fundamentally, being capable and reliable means people trusting me, my family feeling secure, and my business staying afloat so I don't lose everything that gives me purpose. But the second my hands shake my head screams they'll see weakness, whisper, clients pull out, contracts get canceled and the whole business collapses, and I'm feeling jumpier and more distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to look at your hands again. Can you say to yourself, with kindness and compassion, "I am more than my shaking hands"? What would that mean to you, to hold that statement true?

Patient: "I am more than my shaking hands" — I can say the words, and for a whisper of a second they almost settle, but then my mind scrambles: if I admit that, people will think I'm pretending, the whispering will start, clients will pull away, contracts vanish, and my business collapses. I'm not sure I follow how holding that statement actually helps me; my chest's tighter and I'm more jumpy and distracted than before. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the thought that's arising when you say "I am more than my shaking hands." What is it about that thought that makes you feel like it's being undermined by the catastrophic thinking?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I tell myself "I am more than my shaking hands" it feels like I'm pretending to be okay, and my head flips that into proof everyone will see I'm a fraud. Then it's the same loop: whispers, clients pulling out, contracts canceled, my business collapsing — like admitting it just makes the disaster inevitable. I'm getting really rattled and distracted; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to consider that it's okay if your hands are shaking and if others might perceive you as not being in control. Can you imagine, just for a moment, that it's okay to not have all the answers and to be uncertain, without that uncertainty leading to catastrophic thinking?

Patient: I'm not sure I can imagine that — every time I try, my head runs the disaster: my hands show I'm failing, people whisper, clients pull out, contracts vanish, and my business collapses. I'm getting more anxious and distracted — my chest tightens and I can't hold the idea that uncertainty could be harmless. Can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something simple. Can you notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it? Not trying to breathe, just noticing the sensation of the breath as it is.

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow — when I notice the breath for a beat my chest loosens, then my mind snaps: if I calm down they'll notice I'm nervous, whisper, clients will hear, and my business will be ruined. My hands are buzzing more and I'm jumpy and distracted now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try to anchor in the sensation of your breath for just one more moment, without trying to change it or push it away. Can you simply observe the sensation of the breath as it is, without judgment, for just one more second?

Patient: I'm trying to watch the breath, but the moment I feel a bit calmer my head yells that the calm will give the disaster room—I'll blurt something, they'll whisper, clients will pull out, and my business will be ruined. I'm kind of confused about how just noticing the breath helps; it feels like it only makes me more jumpy and distracted instead of settling me. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?
