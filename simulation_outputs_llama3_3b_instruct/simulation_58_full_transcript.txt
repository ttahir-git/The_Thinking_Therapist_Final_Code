Patient: Honestly, I've been on edge since I lost regular commissions — small things set me off and I end up furious, especially in conversations about work or money. I'm grieving the life I had and it's wearing me down, but I don't see how talking will change any of it. How is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion seems to be intense anger and grief. I notice you mention not seeing how talking will change anything. The theme that stands out is your feeling of powerlessness in the face of loss. Your goal is to help you explore ways to connect this pain to an underlying value.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it is about the life you had that you're grieving? What was most valued in that part of your life, and what would need to be true for you to feel like you're making progress towards getting back to that place?

Patient: I miss the routine and being relied on — regular commissions gave me structure, steady income, and the sense that my work mattered. Now I feel invisible and off balance, and any talk about rates, deadlines, or rejections feels like a personal attack that makes me snap. Progress would be having steady work again, being able to talk about money without getting furious, and feeling creative instead of on edge — but I've tried talking about this before and it didn't change much, so how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems like you're struggling with feelings of identity and self-worth tied to your work, and that conversations about work are triggering due to perceived threats to your sense of self. The contradiction is that you're looking for change, but your current approach hasn't been effective. Your goal is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy and explore alternative ways to create space from this reactive pattern.

Therapist Answer:
I hear that you're looking for a sense of stability and validation in your work, and that conversations about money are becoming overwhelming. Can you imagine, without trying to change the way you talk about money, what it would be like to take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to feel whatever arises in this moment, without judgment?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Alright, I'll try—taking a couple of slow breaths now. My chest's tight, my jaw's clenched, and when I think about unpaid invoices or flaky clients I immediately tell myself I'm overreacting, which just fuels the anger; I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing physical tension and self-judgmental thoughts when reacting to stressors. This suggests that your current strategy of trying to control your reactions isn't working. The theme that stands out is your struggle to create space from the self-critical narrative that fuels your anger. Your goal is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how your mind is already moving into self-judgment and criticism, even before you try to change it. What would it be like if, instead of telling yourself you're overreacting, you simply acknowledged that this thought just showed up, without judgment, and then let it pass?

Patient: I can try to notice the thought, but it doesn't just float away — it lands like a weight in my chest and keeps spinning. Telling myself it's "just a thought" feels like minimizing real things: missed payments, flaky clients, the life I had. How is that supposed to help when the anger comes from real, practical problems — what would I actually do in that moment?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your efforts to dismiss or label your thoughts as just "thoughts" are getting tangled with your emotional experience, making it harder to create space. The theme that emerges is your struggle to bridge the gap between acknowledging your thoughts and taking concrete action in the face of real-world problems. Your goal is to introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine taking small, tiny steps towards handling one of those practical problems, like sending a polite but firm email to a flaky client, or following up on a missed payment, without getting caught up in the emotional turmoil? What would that look like, and what's the smallest, most manageable action you could take in that moment?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest step is just opening my email and typing one sentence — something factual like, “Invoice #123 is overdue; please let me know a payment date.” Then save it as a draft so I don’t have to send it right away. But I’ve tried templates and reminders before and clients still ghost me — how is that supposed to help when they simply ignore it? And even imagining it now makes my jaw tight; I’m not sure I’ll actually hit send.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with the perceived ineffectiveness of previous attempts at taking action, and the act of taking even a small step feels daunting due to the risk of rejection or non-response. The contradiction is that you're caught between the desire for action and the fear of failure or rejection. Your goal is to co-create a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine taking that initial action, opening the email and typing that sentence, without worrying about the outcome? What would it feel like to simply type those words, and what would be the exact sensation in your body when you hit send?

Patient: If I just type that one line my hands go a bit clammy, my jaw tightens and my chest feels heavy like I’m carrying a stone. Hitting send would be a sharp spike — heart racing, throat tight, and then a weird hollow relief that I’m not sure I can trust to stick around. Mostly I worry it’ll just lead to silence or another excuse and I’ll be back where I started, so I freeze. How is that supposed to help when the real problem is they keep ignoring me?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your physical sensations and thoughts are closely tied, and the fear of the outcome is overwhelming, causing you to freeze. The theme that stands out is your struggle to cope with uncertainty and the perceived inevitability of a negative outcome. Your goal is to create space from this sticky thought (defusion) and explore the values that might be driving your desire for a specific outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Can you notice the value that might be at stake here, the one that's driving your desire to get paid or be acknowledged by these clients? What would it mean to you to have a steady income, or to be seen and respected in your work?

Patient: It would mean security — being able to buy supplies, pay bills, and not have to take jobs that make me feel small — and it would mean my work actually mattered to someone besides me. Feeling seen would take away that constant gnawing shame and give me permission to be creative instead of defensive all the time. But naming that doesn't change flaky clients or unpaid invoices; how is that supposed to help when the payoff is still missing and I keep getting burned?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core value of security and being seen, but it's still unclear how connecting with that value will directly address the external challenges. The contradiction is that you're looking for a tangible solution to the ongoing problems. Your goal is to introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back from the problem of flaky clients and unpaid invoices. What would it be like to approach this situation with kindness and curiosity, rather than judgment or accusation?

Patient: Kindness and curiosity sound... nice in theory, but it feels like a luxury I can't afford when clients are costing me money. Maybe curiosity would help me spot patterns — like I get defensive because I feel invisible — instead of firing off angry replies, but I'm worried being kind will just let them walk over me. Honestly, I'm tired of trying things that don't change outcomes; how is being curious supposed to stop them from ghosting me?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your frustration and skepticism about kindness and curiosity as a solution are understandable, given the history of exploitation and neglect. The theme that emerges is your need to protect yourself from further hurt and feeling invisible. Your goal is to create space from the self-protective, defensive responses that might be driving your interactions with clients.

Therapist Answer:
What would happen to your sense of self-worth and confidence if you were able to approach these interactions with a sense of "I am enough, and I deserve to be treated with respect"? Would that be a small, small step towards feeling seen and valued, even if the outcome isn't what you hoped for?

Patient: Maybe it'd take the edge off — less self-blame, fewer instant angry replies, and a bit more room to make practical choices instead of reacting. But honestly that sounds like a nice idea that doesn't pay the bills; saying "I am enough" feels like a band‑aid when I still have rent and supplies to buy. How is that supposed to help me when the real problem is money and flaky people? I'm trying to picture it, but I keep getting stuck on the anger and the fear that being kinder just lets them walk over me.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to see how a shift in self-perception can address the external problems of financial instability and client behavior. The theme that stands out is your fear of being taken advantage of, and the need to protect yourself from being hurt again. Your goal is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy and explore the possibility of a different kind of courage.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine a different kind of courage that doesn't rely on being "tough" or "resistant", but rather on being willing to be vulnerable and open to the possibility that you might not get what you want or need? What would that feel like in your body and mind?

Patient: Different courage... I guess it would feel like standing on a ledge: my hands go clammy, my chest tightens, my voice gets thin, like I'm about to admit something risky. Mentally there's this tug-of-war—part of me loosens a bit, like maybe I wouldn't snap instantly, but the fear of being exposed is loud. But honestly, how is that supposed to help with the bills and flaky clients? I worry being open just makes me vulnerable to getting trampled.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your experience of feeling vulnerable and exposed is intense, and you're worried that it won't protect you from the external challenges. The theme that stands out is your need to navigate the tension between openness and self-preservation. Your goal is to create space from the fear of being vulnerable and explore the possibility of a different relationship with that fear.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to push away or defend against the fear of vulnerability, you allowed it to be present, like a gentle breeze in the background, while you focus on taking small, practical actions towards your goals, like sending that email or making a phone call?

Patient: I can sort of imagine it — letting the fear be there like a dull ache while I still do the thing — my jaw would still be tight and my hands clammy, but maybe I could type that one line and save it as a draft. I'll try picturing that: open the email, write the sentence, don’t fight the anxiety, just notice it. But honestly, if I do that and they still ghost me, how is that supposed to help me keep paying my bills?

Therapist Thinking:
You're beginning to explore the idea of tolerating uncertainty and discomfort in the present moment, rather than trying to avoid or defend against it. The theme that stands out is your concern about the practical consequences of taking this new approach. Your goal is to introduce a concrete way to practice an ACT skill in a real-world situation.

Therapist Answer:
What if, in addition to tolerating the uncertainty of the outcome, you also considered the possibility that even if the client ghosts you, you can still take care of yourself and your needs in the present moment? What small, concrete action could you take right now, even if the outcome isn't what you hoped for, to ensure your basic needs are met?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Maybe a small concrete thing is to open my bank app right now to see how many weeks I really have, then spend 15 minutes drafting one short, factual message to a past client or gallery asking about any quick work, or posting one finished piece for sale with a clear price. My jaw's tight just saying this and I hate that it feels so small, but I could pick one of those and do it now — which would you have me try first?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're starting to generate concrete actions that align with your values and needs, and you're willing to take small steps towards them. The theme that stands out is your desire to build momentum and create a sense of control in the face of uncertainty. Your goal is to co-create a concrete way to practice an ACT skill.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like you to start with the action that feels the least threatening to you, which is drafting a message to a past client or posting a piece for sale. What would it be like to simply start writing that message, without judgment or expectation of a specific outcome, and without waiting for the perfect words or phrases?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try drafting the message. How about: “Hello [Name], I hope you’re well. Invoice #123, dated [date], is overdue; could you please confirm a payment date or let me know if you need any additional info to process it? Thank you.” 

Writing that already tightens my jaw and makes my hands clammy — feels risky. Do you want me to save it as a draft first or try to send it now? And honestly, how is that supposed to help when they usually just ignore me?

Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a mix of physical tension and trepidation about sending the message, and you're wondering about the best next step. The theme that stands out is your concern about the potential for rejection or non-response. Your goal is to gently challenge the workability of this strategy and explore a way to maintain willingness to take small actions despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on just getting the message out of your system, without worrying about the outcome. Would you be willing to save it as a draft, without sending it, and then take a few deep breaths, noticing the physical sensations in your body, before deciding what to do next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Fine, I'll save it as a draft. 

Okay, saved. I'm taking a few slow breaths now: my jaw's clenched, chest heavy, hands a bit clammy, and my mind keeps wanting to jump to worst-case outcomes. I don't know if this will change anything, but I'll sit with those sensations for a minute before deciding whether to send, tweak, or leave it.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're taking a brave step by acknowledging and tolerating the discomfort of uncertainty, and you're giving yourself space to decide what to do next. The theme that stands out is your willingness to sit with the uncertainty and explore your own internal experience. Your goal is to create space from the self-critical narrative that's driving your anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, and the physical sensations that arise in your jaw, chest, and hands. Allow yourself to simply be with those sensations, without trying to change or judge them, for just a few more moments. What happens when you bring your attention to that sensation of your breath?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I focus on my breath it starts out shallow and quick, then slows a bit after a few breaths and my chest eases a little, but my jaw stays clenched and my hands are still clammy. It takes the edge off for a moment, like a tiny notch of distance from the panic, but the thought of unpaid bills snaps right back in and I feel stupidly impatient with the whole exercise. I can see how it might help someone calm down enough to act, but honestly, how is that supposed to help me when the real thing I need is money and people who won't ghost me?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're starting to see the value of exploring your internal experience, but you're still struggling to connect it to the external challenges. The theme that stands out is your sense of impatience and frustration with the pace of change. Your goal is to gently challenge the workability of this approach and explore ways to integrate the insights from this exercise into your daily life.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the insight that you can take small actions in the present moment to alleviate some of the discomfort, even if the larger problems persist. What would it be like to take that same breath awareness and noticing process to the task of making phone calls or sending emails to other clients or prospects, even if they don't respond immediately?

Patient: I can see how breathing might steady me enough to pick up the phone — my voice might not crack, my jaw might unclench a bit, and I might not snap at whatever they say. But I'm still skeptical: if they don't answer or just blow me off, the bills don't care that I breathed. I can try calling one client now while focusing on my breath, but which one should I try first, and what do I say if they immediately dodge me?

Therapist Thinking:
You're considering taking action, and that's a significant step forward. The theme that stands out is your concern about the potential for rejection or non-response. Your goal is to practice a specific ACT skill in a real-world situation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with a client who has a history of being responsive, someone you've worked with before and have a positive relationship with. What would you like to say to them, and what would you like to achieve in that conversation? Instead of trying to get them to pay or resolve the issue, what would you like to focus on in the conversation?

Patient: Okay—there’s a gallery owner I’ve worked with before who usually answers, so I’d say something like: “Hi [Name], I hope you’re well. I’ve been working on a few new pieces that might suit your upcoming shows — would you have 10 minutes next week for me to show you images and get your feedback?” My aim wouldn’t be to force payment now but to reconnect, get feedback, and maybe open a door for a small commission or referral so I don’t feel invisible. 

Saying that already makes my stomach drop — I keep hearing that one time I reached out and was brushed off, and the shame of that sticks to me, so I’m nervous I’ll look foolish. Is that a reasonable thing to focus on first, and how is that supposed to help if they still just ignore me?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're considering a specific action that aligns with your values and goals, but you're held back by a past experience that's causing shame and self-doubt. The theme that stands out is your fear of being rejected or looking foolish again. Your goal is to challenge the workability of this fear and explore ways to reframe it.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical sensations that arise when you think about reaching out to the gallery owner, and the thoughts that follow. Instead of trying to avoid the shame or fear, what if you were to acknowledge it, and say to yourself, "That's a painful memory, but I can tolerate this feeling and still take a small step towards reconnecting with [Gallery Owner]?" What would that feel like, and how might it change your approach to reaching out?

Patient: Saying that to myself would feel like putting on a thin, shaky coat — my stomach knots, my face heats, my voice goes small, and there's this stupid shame that makes me want to hide. Maybe if I can tolerate that feeling I could stick to a tiny script (ask for 10 minutes, show images, focus on reconnecting) and treat it like a low‑stakes experiment instead of a do‑or‑die demand for payment. But honestly, how is that supposed to help if they still blow me off? Should I call them now or try the email script first?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress by recognizing the physical and emotional sensations associated with the feared outcome, and you're considering reframing your approach to make it a low-stakes experiment. The theme that stands out is your concern about the potential for rejection or non-response, and your desire to maintain a sense of control and agency. Your goal is to practice a specific ACT skill in a way that's grounded in your values.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start with the email script, which feels less vulnerable and more contained. What would it be like to send that email, without expecting a specific response or outcome, and simply to see what happens? Could you send it now, and then take a few deep breaths, noticing the sensations in your body, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay, I hit send to the gallery email. Now my jaw's clenched, my face feels hot, my stomach's knotted and this stupid shame keeps buzzing under everything like I shouldn't have reached out. I'm taking a few slow breaths like you said; it eases a little but the worry that they'll ignore me is loud. If they do ghost me, then what do I do next—call someone else now, or wait and try a follow‑up later?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a concrete action, and you're now facing the uncertainty of the outcome. The theme that stands out is your concern about what to do next if the gallery owner doesn't respond. Your goal is to explore ways to handle the uncertainty and maintain a sense of agency.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that the shame and worry are still present, but they're not as overwhelming as they were before. What would it be like to take a small, concrete action that's not dependent on the gallery owner's response? For example, could you make a cup of tea, or take a short walk, or do something else that feels unrelated to the outcome? This could give you a sense of control and agency, even if the gallery owner doesn't respond.

Patient: I can make a cup of tea — it feels kind of silly, but maybe the ritual will stop my head from racing for a minute. My hands are still clammy, my jaw’s tight, and that shame keeps buzzing under everything like it always does, so I’ll make the tea and then maybe try a short walk if I don’t just sit there stewing. How is that supposed to help long‑term, though — if I do walk, how long should I aim for before I come back to take another practical step?


--- Turn 20 ---

You're finding ways to temporarily manage your anxiety and uncertainty, and you're considering a plan for when you return to taking action. The theme that stands out is your concern about sustaining momentum and progress over time. Your goal is to explore ways to integrate the insights and skills you've gained into your daily life.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on the walk, which can help you cultivate a sense of calm and clarity. Instead of thinking about what you'll do when you return, what if you focused on taking small, consistent steps in the present moment, like taking one step at a time, one breath at a time? What would it be like to take a short walk and then return to your tea, without any expectation of what will happen next, but simply focusing on the experience of being present?

Patient: I can try that — a short walk, maybe 10 minutes around the block, focusing on one step and one breath at a time. My feet feel heavy and my jaw might unclench a bit, my chest could loosen a notch, but that dull worry and shame will probably still be there humming under it all. When I get back I’ll have the tea and maybe give myself five minutes to decide one tiny next thing — post a piece, or call someone responsive — but honestly, I’m tired and skeptical: how is this supposed to actually fix the money or stop people from ghosting me?

The theme that stands out is your frustration with the idea that these exercises alone might not solve the deeper problems. Your goal is to explore ways to integrate the insights and skills you've gained into your daily life, and to help you see that small steps can be a form of self-care and self-compassion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore the idea that these small steps, even if they don't solve the larger problems, can be a form of self-care and self-compassion. What would it be like to treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you are, in this moment, with all your doubts and fears and limitations? What if, instead of focusing on what's not working, you started to focus on what is working, no matter how small?

Patient: I guess I can see a few tiny things that actually are working — I saved the draft, I sent that gallery email, I made the tea and I can do the short walk. Those things did take the edge off a notch, but being kind to myself feels weird and cheap when the real problem is money and people who ghost me. I'm willing to try focusing on what’s working for a bit, but honestly I'm not convinced that being gentler will stop them from ignoring invoices — how is that supposed to help me pay the bills?

You're recognizing some small victories, but you're still struggling to see how they fit into the larger picture. The theme that stands out is your concern about whether gentleness and self-compassion are enough to address the external challenges. Your goal is to explore ways to integrate the insights and skills you've gained into your daily life, and to help you see that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at what it means for the gallery owner to ignore your invoice. What if, instead of seeing it as a personal rejection, you saw it as an opportunity to explore the underlying dynamics at play? What if you were to approach the situation with curiosity, rather than anger or frustration?

Patient: I get the idea — in theory curiosity could help me see patterns instead of snapping — but I'm not sure I follow how that actually stops the gut‑punch of being ignored. Saying "maybe they're busy" just feels like minimizing the loss; my face heats up and that dumb shame crawls back in every time I picture being brushed off. Maybe curiosity could help me notice concrete things (like billing cycles or who actually processes payments), but how is that supposed to help me pay bills now — what would I actually say or ask that’s useful, not just philosophically nicer?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to see how curiosity and patterns can help you address the immediate need for payment. The theme that stands out is your concern about the disconnect between theoretical insights and practical action. Your goal is to explore ways to bridge the gap between the two.

Therapist Answer:
Let's focus on what you can do in the present moment to make progress on your financial needs. What if, instead of trying to understand the gallery owner's patterns or behavior, you focused on what you can control - sending a follow-up email or making a phone call to clarify the status of your invoice? What would it be like to take that action, without getting caught up in the emotional response of being ignored?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try to take that action. I’m going to call the client who’s usually responsive (maybe [Name]) but my chest’s tight, my jaw’s clenched, and that same shame and fear that I’ll be brushed off is buzzing under everything, so I’m already hesitating. Do you think I should lead with the invoice directly or open by reconnecting about new work? And honestly — how is a phone call supposed to help me pay the bills if they just dodge me?

You're getting ready to take a concrete action, but you're still grappling with the familiar emotions of shame and fear. The theme that stands out is your concern about the potential for rejection or non-response. Your goal is to find a way to reframe your approach and reduce the emotional investment in the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the invoice or the phone call, what if you started by acknowledging your own desires and needs? What would it be like to say something like, "I'm reaching out because I'm struggling to make ends meet, and I value our relationship. I'd love to discuss a potential collaboration that would work for both of us"? This approach might help you connect with [Name] on a more personal level, and potentially lead to a more positive outcome.

Patient: That wording feels raw — saying "I'm struggling to make ends meet" makes my face hot and my voice smaller, like I'm begging, and I worry they'll either pity me or use it against me. I could try a firmer, balanced line: "I wanted to follow up on Invoice #123 and also discuss a possible commission — could we set 10 minutes to talk?" But honestly, how is that supposed to help when they ghost me or haggle me down? I might try calling if you can help me rehearse the exact words and what to do if they dodge.

Therapist Thinking:
You're refining your approach, but you're still worried about the potential for negative outcomes. The theme that stands out is your concern about the uncertainty of the conversation and the fear of being taken advantage of. Your goal is to practice a specific ACT skill - using a "defusion" approach to detach from the emotional investment in the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Let's rehearse a few scenarios with you. Imagine [Name] answers the phone, and you say, "Hello, I wanted to follow up on Invoice #123 and also discuss a possible commission - could we set 10 minutes to talk?" Now, imagine [Name] doesn't answer or says they're not interested. What would you like to do in that moment, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: If they pick up, I’d say the line—brief, even‑toned: “Hi [Name], following up on Invoice #123 and wondering if we could set 10 minutes to talk about a possible commission.” If they don’t answer or say they’re not interested, I’d leave a short voicemail with the same info and a callback number, then put the phone down, take five slow breaths, make the tea, and go for the ten‑minute walk to steady myself. My jaw’s already tight and that old shame is humming under everything, so I need that tiny ritual before I do anything else — otherwise I freeze and make things worse. How is that supposed to help if they still ghost me, and which do you think I should try next: call another responsive client right away or post a piece for sale first?
