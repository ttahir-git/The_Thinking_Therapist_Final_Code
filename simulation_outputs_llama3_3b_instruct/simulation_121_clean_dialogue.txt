Patient: I'm a teacher in my mid-fifties, and lately I've been leaning on asking for reassurance a lot — checking with colleagues or my partner about things I said, or rereading emails to see if I came off badly — mostly to quiet the tightness in my chest. It feels like a numb habit more than actual help, and I've tried stopping before and it just doesn't stick. How is that supposed to help? I'm skeptical this will change much, but here I am.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "quieting the tightness in your chest"? What specifically happens when you notice that sensation, and what would you be hoping to achieve by checking with others or re-reading emails?

Patient: It feels physical — my chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, my mind goes to worst-case scenarios about what people think of me. When that starts I compulsively reread emails, text or ask a colleague or my partner if I came off poorly, looking for a quick "no, you're fine" to ease it. I'm hoping for certainty or at least to stop the worry, but it only calms things for a few minutes and then I want more. How is that supposed to help? I've tried forcing myself not to do it and it just makes the anxiety louder.

Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of avoidance that's not providing the relief you're looking for. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to "proof" yourself to others, you simply acknowledged the anxiety as it arises, without trying to seek reassurance? What would that look like, and how might that be different from what you're doing now?

Patient: So I guess that would mean noticing the tightness, thinking “this is anxiety,” and not immediately calling someone or rereading the message — maybe breathing, letting the feeling sit for a bit instead of trying to erase it. In my head that sounds like just letting the worry fester; when I’ve tried it before it felt like I was ignoring the problem and then replaying it later. How is letting it hang out supposed to stop me from checking? I’ve done some mindfulness stuff and it didn’t stick — can you give me something practical that actually helps in the moment when I feel like I’m going to spiral?

Therapist: I'm not suggesting that letting go of the anxiety will solve everything, but rather creating space for a different response. Have you considered what would be a small, concrete action you could take in the moment that aligns with your values as a teacher, such as taking a few deep breaths, writing down a simple phrase that reminds you of your values, or stepping away from the situation for a minute to collect your thoughts? Sometimes, taking small, action-oriented steps can help create a sense of control and calm.

Patient: I'm willing to try small steps, but honestly when the tightness hits breathing or a phrase feels hollow — it doesn't stop the replaying, it just delays it. How is that supposed to help when my first instinct is to check my messages or call someone? Give me something concrete I can do in the moment — a step-by-step I can actually remember and use, not just "breathe" or "think of values."

Therapist: When you feel the tightness in your chest and the urge to check your messages, take your phone out of your pocket and put it on the other side of the room. This simple physical action can create a brief delay and interrupt the cycle of checking. Can you imagine what it might be like to take a few deep breaths, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or make a small gesture that signals to yourself that you're taking a break from checking?

Patient: I've tried putting the phone away before and it just delayed the urge — I'd get up later to check and feel worse, so I'm skeptical. How is putting it across the room supposed to help when my mind keeps replaying the worst-case and the tightness feels almost physical? Give me a very simple, 3-step script I can actually remember under stress — exact words to say to myself, how long to pause, and one discreet grounding action I can do in class without leaving — and tell me what to do when that tightness spikes and starts to feel dangerous, not just "breathe."

Therapist: When you feel the tightness and worst-case scenarios start to arise, say to yourself: "I'm feeling anxious right now, and that's okay. I'm here with my students now, and I can take care of them." Take a brief pause of 20-30 seconds, then discreetly do a simple physical action in class, like tapping your left foot three times or tracing the outline of a chair with your finger. If the tightness spikes and starts to feel overwhelming, acknowledge it directly: "My chest is tight, and that's okay. I've got this."

Patient: Okay, that’s a bit more practical, but I’m still skeptical. The 20–30 second pause feels long — can that be 10 seconds? Give me a very short script I can actually remember (like 6–8 words) and one discreet grounding action I can do while sitting — maybe pressing thumb to forefinger three times or planting my feet and squeezing my thighs. What exactly should I say if it spikes into panic — something like “This will pass, four slow breaths” — and how is that supposed to help when my brain keeps replaying the worst? I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling.

Therapist: When you feel the tightness, say to yourself: "Teaching. Now." Take a brief pause of 5-10 seconds, then discreetly press your thumb to your middle finger three times. If it spikes into panic, acknowledge the sensation directly: "I've got this. My students need me." This exercise is meant to connect you to your role as a teacher, which can help ground you in the present moment and reduce the replaying of worst-case scenarios. The phrase "Teaching. Now" is designed to be a quick reminder of your values and role, which can help shift your focus away from the anxiety.

Patient: Okay... I can try "Teaching. Now." — it sounds annoyingly simple, but I'll give it a shot. How is that supposed to help with the replaying later though? Say I use it in class and the urge to check comes back five minutes later or when I get home and call my partner for reassurance — what exact next steps do I use to stop myself from checking or calling? Also, if it spikes into real panic — dizzy, chest so tight I can't think — give me a very short 3-4 step action I can do right then, no fluff.

Therapist: When you use the "Teaching. Now" exercise, commit to taking a specific action immediately after, such as taking a few more deep breaths, writing down a brief note to yourself, or doing a quick physical task like making a cup of tea. This can help create a clear chain of events and make it easier to stay on track. 

If it spikes into panic: 
1. Acknowledge the feeling directly: "I'm panicking."
2. Take a deep breath in through your nose, out through your mouth.
3. Place your hand on your heart or chest to ground yourself.
4. Speak in a calm, clear voice: "I've got this."

Patient: Alright, I can try it, but saying "I'm panicking" out loud or putting my hand on my chest in class feels awkward — what's a totally private version I can use instead? Also, if the urge to check or call my partner hits later, what short script do I say to myself to stop it, and what if the breathing/hand thing doesn't actually calm me? Honestly, I'm skeptical this will change the replaying later — how is that supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: Instead of saying "I'm panicking" out loud, try the following private acknowledgement: "Pause." 

If the urge to check or call your partner hits later, say to yourself: "Not now. I'll check my messages later." 

If the breathing and hand exercises don't calm you down, try the following private action: "Take 10 more steps." This can help create a sense of physical movement and distance from the anxiety. 

As for the long-term impact, it's not about eliminating the replaying of worst-case scenarios entirely, but rather about learning to tolerate them and respond to them in a more constructive way. By practicing the "Teaching. Now" exercise, you're developing a tool to help you manage your anxiety in the moment, which can lead to increased resilience and flexibility over time.

Patient: Alright, I’ll try—reluctantly. I need very specific, practical stuff: what exact delay actually helps (10, 20, 30 minutes?), and a fail-safe for when that delay ends and I’m still itching to call or check—what do I do instead, step-by-step? Give me one short private 3-step panic script I can use when dizzy/terrified (no breathing-only stuff), and one two-line thing I can tell my partner so they stop giving me reassurance (I don’t want to be a burden). I’m trying to see how this actually connects to my problem, but I’m still really skeptical.

Therapist: Delay: Try a 5-minute delay. This is short enough to be manageable but long enough to create a sense of separation between the anxiety and the action.

Fail-safe: If the 5-minute delay ends and you're still feeling anxious, go for a short walk outside or do 5-10 jumping jacks. This physical activity can help create a sense of movement and release tension.

Private panic script:
1. Look around the room and find an object that can be smashed or broken (e.g., a stress ball, a pillow, or a small toy).
2. Say to yourself: "I will smash this object when I'm calm."
3. Focus on the object and wait until you feel calm enough to smash it.

When with your partner: 
"I'm feeling overwhelmed, but I need some space to process. Can we catch up later when I'm feeling more centered?"

This exercise is designed to create a clear distinction between the anxiety and the action, providing a sense of control and agency. By practicing the "Teaching. Now" exercise and incorporating the delay, fail-safe, private panic script, and communication with your partner, you can develop a more effective coping strategy for managing anxiety.

Patient: No — the smashing-object thing feels really off and a bit dangerous. I'm not doing that. I'm also unclear why 5 minutes is the "right" delay — how is that supposed to help more than 10 or 30? 

If you want me to try this, give me three concrete, private steps I can actually use when dizzy/panicky (no breathing-only, no saying "I'm panicking" out loud). Give me one discreet classroom alternative to jumping jacks or going for a walk. And give me a two-line text I can send my partner that clearly stops reassurance (not vague). I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical this will change the replaying unless it's actually usable in the moment.

Therapist: Private steps for when dizzy/panicky:

1. Look around the room and find a non-distracting object, such as a pen or a small decorative item.
2. Gently pick up the object and examine it without focusing on your anxiety.
3. Set the object down and continue with your current task, even if it's just for a few seconds.

Discreet classroom alternative to jumping jacks or going for a walk: Quickly glance out the window or at a nearby plant. This can help you focus on the external environment and create a sense of separation from your anxiety.

Text to send to your partner:

"I'm okay, but I need space to process. I'll check in when I'm feeling more centered."

This exercise is designed to provide a sense of control and agency in the moment, allowing you to tolerate the discomfort of anxiety without resorting to avoidance or seeking external validation. By practicing the "Teaching. Now" exercise and incorporating the private steps, discreet classroom alternative, and clear text, you can develop a more effective coping strategy for managing anxiety.

Patient: Okay, this is more usable but I'm still skeptical. Give me three exact private steps I can use when dizzy/panicky (no breathing-only, no saying “I’m panicking” out loud) with timing (e.g., count to 5), one fully discrete classroom alternative to walking/jumping I can do while seated, and a two-line text that stops reassurance outright. Also, briefly explain why 5 minutes is the right delay instead of 10 or 30, and give a clear step-by-step fail-safe for when that delay ends and I'm still itching to check.

Therapist: Private steps for when dizzy/panicky (counting and body awareness):

1. Count to 10 in your head, focusing on the numbers and their sequence.
2. Place your hands on your thighs and squeeze your legs gently, holding for 2 seconds.
3. Release your hands and look around the room, focusing on a non-distracting object.

Discrete classroom alternative to walking/jumping while seated: Tap your pen on the desk three times, then place it back in its original position.

Text to stop reassurance:

"I'm not seeking reassurance, I need to trust myself to handle this."

Delay explanation: The 5-minute delay is chosen because it's long enough to create a sense of separation between the anxiety and the action, but short enough to avoid prolonged avoidance. It allows you to acknowledge the anxiety without getting stuck in a cycle of reassurance-seeking.

Fail-safe for when the delay ends:

1. Take a small sip of water from your water bottle.
2. Look around the room and find a small object, such as a book or a pen, and briefly examine it.
3. Start your next task, even if it's just for 30 seconds.

This exercise is designed to provide a clear, step-by-step approach to managing anxiety in the moment. By practicing the "Teaching. Now" exercise and incorporating the private steps, discrete classroom alternative, and clear text, you can develop a more effective coping strategy for managing anxiety.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try, but a few things bother me. Counting to 10 feels long when I’m dizzy; can we make that count to 5 and have each number tied to a clear focus (e.g., 1 — name a color, 2 — press thighs, 3 — name a sound, 4 — look at object, 5 — sit still)? How is that supposed to help the dizziness, not just distract it? 

Also, pen-tapping might draw attention — give me one fully discreet seated action (thumb-to-index three presses was okay earlier; confirm that) and a two-line text to send my partner that shuts down reassurance for good: “I don’t need reassurance right now. Please don’t respond to my worries — I’ll reach out when I need you.” 

Finally, if the 5-minute delay ends and I still want to check, I want a concrete fail-safe: step-by-step (set a single “check window” time, do X physical task, text partner a one-line delay note). Spell that out exactly so I can actually use it, because I’m skeptical this will stick unless it’s idiot-proof.
