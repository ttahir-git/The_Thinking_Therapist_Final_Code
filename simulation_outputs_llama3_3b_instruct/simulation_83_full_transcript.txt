--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck worrying non-stop about my performance at work as a data scientist, and it's turned into this loop of procrastination where I can't even start things. My brain immediately jumps to the worst — I'll ship a buggy model, the product will fail, they'll blame me and I'll get fired, then I won't be able to find another job and everything I've saved will be gone. I know people say other outcomes are possible, but that just feels unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses a strong core emotion of anxiety and fear of failure. One specific theme or unexplored area is the lack of willingness to tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity in their work. Goal: Explore the tangible context of this avoidance behavior and its relationship to valued actions.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what it would be like to not have this constant worry and self-doubt before starting a project? What would you be doing instead of worrying about the worst-case scenarios?

Patient: I think if I wasn't wrapped up in worry I'd actually start the work — open the data, run a few experiments, write some code, maybe get into a rhythm instead of avoiding it. But the minute I picture doing that, my head goes straight to the worst: I'll miss a tiny flaw, the model will silently wreck the product, customers will complain, my manager will trace it back to me and I'll be fired, and then everything else follows. I know you're asking me to imagine calm, but honestly that feels unrealistic — the disaster story is the only thing my brain sells me, and I get stuck on it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking is deeply ingrained, and they're struggling to imagine an alternative to this cycle of avoidance. One specific aspect of their thought process is the disproportionate emphasis on potential catastrophic consequences. Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy and explore the possibility of alternative, less reactive approaches.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought "my manager will trace it back to me and I'll be fired" is really powerful for you. Can you explore what would happen if, for just a brief moment, you let go of the idea that you're entirely responsible for the outcome? Would it be possible to view this as a team effort, or that there are multiple factors at play?

Patient: I can't really see it that way — when I try to think of it as a team thing my mind just stitches together a chain where, yes, others were involved but somehow the trail points back to me. Maybe a subtle edge-case slips through, customers complain, they dig into the logs and one of my commits looks like the culprit, and suddenly I'm the scapegoat. I know that's probably not rational, but it feels inevitable to me and that's what freezes me.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's tendency to mentally construct a chain of causality and assign blame reinforces their catastrophic thinking. One specific area that needs attention is the way they're using their values to justify this avoidance. Goal: Connect this pain to an underlying value and explore how it might be worth taking action despite the uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you value being a good data scientist and doing a great job. Can you think of a situation where you're willing to take a risk, learn from a mistake, and potentially fail, but ultimately believe it's worth it because it aligns with your values? What would you be preserving or promoting by taking action in this situation?

Patient: I guess maybe a situation would be trying a small, experimental model on a sandbox or non-critical dataset — it feels like it would help me stay sharp and honest about my skills, which I value. But of course my mind immediately maps out the disaster: the experiment somehow affects production, an obscure edge-case slips past, customers freak out, logs point to my work, and I'm on the hook. I know you're asking me to see the upside, but that outcome feels like the only realistic one, so it still doesn't feel worth it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing the value of taking calculated risks, but their catastrophic thinking is overpowering their willingness. One specific area to focus on is the notion of "realistic" outcomes and how it's influencing their decision-making. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle, and explore the possibility of creating space from the sticky thought.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your notion of "realism" is closely tied to the potential consequences. Would you be willing to experiment with a smaller, more manageable risk, where the stakes are lower, but the potential benefits are still significant, such as improved skills and confidence?

Patient: I don't think I can—when I try to picture a "low-stakes" experiment my brain immediately stitches a path where the sandbox somehow touches production, a config slip or pipeline quirk lets bad data through, customers blow up, and the logs point right at me. Even imagining "ironclad safeguards" feels pointless because I can always see a tiny failure mode that leads back to me and then it's definitely my fault. So it still feels unmanageable and that's what keeps me stuck.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking is deeply ingrained, and they're struggling to disentangle the concept of risk from the concept of personal responsibility. One specific area to explore is the idea of defusion, where they start to see their thoughts as mere thoughts, rather than reality. Goal: Create space from this sticky thought and explore a more flexible, flexible thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Rather than focusing on the specific details of a potential failure, can you simply acknowledge your thoughts as "thinking" and "imagining" instead of assuming they're true? Would you be willing to try a small experiment, just to see what happens, without necessarily expecting a catastrophic outcome?

Patient: I don't think I can — when I try to imagine "just seeing," my head immediately threads a leak: a local test somehow hits staging, a cron job backfills it to prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired. I'm feeling really overwhelmed by that story; it makes even tiny experiments feel impossible. Maybe I'm stubborn, but honestly other outcomes just don't feel realistic to me.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's tendency to engage with their thoughts in a very immediate and reactive way is causing them distress. One specific area to explore is the idea of defusion, where they start to see their thoughts as just thoughts, rather than reality. Goal: Create space from this sticky thought and introduce a mindfulness practice to help them develop a more flexible perspective.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your body, starting with your feet on the ground and working your way up to the top of your head? As you focus on each part of your body, allow any tension or discomfort to simply be present, without trying to change it or engage with it.

Patient: My feet feel planted but there's a tight, buzzing tension in my calves and a sort of hollowness under my ribs when I try to notice it. Almost instantly my head turns it into a story — that tightness means I'm panicking, I'll freeze during a deploy, something will break, they'll trace it back to me — and I get flooded. I'm feeling really overwhelmed by that loop right now; can we slow down? I can't seem to just observe without the catastrophe taking over.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to disentangle their bodily sensations from their catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the role of mindfulness in creating a sense of spaciousness and flexibility. Goal: Introduce a mindful pause to help the patient develop a sense of defusion.

Therapist Answer:
Let's pause for a moment and take a few deep breaths together. As we inhale, allow the breath to fill the space in your body, and as we exhale, allow any tension or discomfort to release. When you're ready, when you feel more grounded, can you bring your attention to your breath again, without trying to change or engage with it?

Patient: I tried to follow the breaths and there was a brief steadiness, but almost immediately my mind threaded that same catastrophe — a test leaks into staging, a cron backfills prod, customers notice, and somehow the blame traces back to me. I'm feeling really overwhelmed again; can we slow down and stay with the breathing a bit longer?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is having difficulty creating a sustained pause in their catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the potential for a temporary "non-judgmental witness" to observe their thoughts without engaging with them. Goal: Introduce a brief, non-judgmental awareness of the thoughts, rather than getting caught up in them.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to simply observe your thoughts, without judgment or trying to change them. Can you notice the thought "a test leaks into staging, a cron backfills prod, customers notice, and somehow the blame traces back to me" as just a thought, without trying to label it as true or false? Notice the words, the structure, the rhythm... just observe.

Patient: I tried to notice it, but the moment I hold those words they're like a script my mind plays on repeat — first the test, then the cron, then the customers, then the blame — and it feels like a countdown that's definitely going to happen. I can hear the words and the rhythm, but I can't make myself treat them as just thoughts; they come with that heavy certainty. I'm feeling really overwhelmed by that conviction; can we slow down and stay with it a bit longer?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's thoughts have become self-reinforcing and feel impossible to observe as mere thoughts. One specific area to explore is the role of values in undermining their willingness to tolerate uncertainty. Goal: Introduce a value-based approach to help the patient re-evaluate their relationship with certainty.

Therapist Answer:
Can you recall a situation where you felt confident and certain about something, and yet, in the moment, you also felt a sense of peace and clarity? What were you doing in that situation, and what values were you living by?

Patient: Yeah — a couple years ago I led a cross-team review and found a gnarly pipeline bug no one else had caught; I fixed it, the tests passed, and I actually felt calm and clear, like my attention to detail mattered. In that moment I felt I was honoring values of competence and responsibility, but of course my brain immediately threaded the worst — that fix is just papering over a deeper issue that'll blow up later and they'll trace it back to me — and I get flooded again. I'm feeling a bit shaky bringing that up; can we stay with that feeling a little longer?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is bringing up a valuable example that highlights their values of competence and responsibility. One specific area to explore is how this experience can be used to inform their current approach to uncertainty. Goal: Explore how this experience can be a clue to re-evaluating their relationship with certainty and taking action despite uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like in that moment, you felt confident and competent when you were able to identify and fix the bug. Can you imagine that feeling again, but this time, instead of jumping to worst-case scenarios, what if you allowed yourself to feel that sense of competence and responsibility in the present moment, without the expectation of avoiding future problems? What would it be like to trust that your attention to detail and competence would serve you well, even in uncertain situations?

Patient: I wish I could sit with that calm competence — I can almost feel it, like when I fixed that pipeline — but my mind immediately hijacks it: I fix the visible bug, then a deeper one hides, later a test or cron exposes it and production breaks, the logs show my commit, and I'm the one who gets blamed and fired. It feels like trusting that competence is just setting myself up for a bigger fall, and I'm really shaky saying that; can we stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of competence in the face of uncertainty, and their mind is hijacking that sense of calm with catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the notion that competence is not about being perfect, but about being able to learn from and adapt to uncertainty. Goal: Introduce a concept that challenges the patient's notion of perfectionism.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that your competence and responsibility are not about being immune to mistakes, but about being able to learn from them and grow as a result? What would it be like to view your current approach as a chance to learn and improve, rather than a guarantee of failure?

Patient: I can try to imagine it as learning, but my brain immediately turns it into the same narrative: I patch one thing, a deeper bug hides, months later production breaks, the logs show my commit, my manager pins it on me and I'm fired — it's like a script that definitely plays out. That certainty makes "learning" feel like setting myself up for a bigger fall instead of growth. I'm really flooded by that story right now; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's mind is struggling to disentangle the concept of learning from uncertainty with the catastrophic narrative of failure. One specific area to explore is the idea of developing a growth mindset that emphasizes effort, not perfection. Goal: Introduce the concept of "good enough" and its potential to reduce perfectionism.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that it's okay to do something "good enough" for now, rather than waiting for perfection? What would it be like to prioritize progress over perfection, and to view the current approach as a step towards growth, rather than a guarantee of failure?

Patient: I can try to imagine "good enough," but my brain immediately runs the worst script — I push a pragmatic change, a tiny edge-case survives, it somehow hits production, customers freak out, and the logs point squarely at my commit. Then my manager pins it on me, I'm fired, my savings start to drain, and I won't be able to find another job because my reputation's ruined. I'm really overwhelmed by that picture; can we slow down and sit with it a bit longer?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's catastrophic thinking is dominating their ability to consider the idea of "good enough". One specific area to explore is the concept of "acceptance" as a means of reducing anxiety. Goal: Introduce the idea of accepting the present moment, rather than resisting it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine taking a deep breath and simply accepting the current situation, without judgment or resistance? What would it be like to acknowledge the anxiety and uncertainty, and instead of trying to change it, to allow it to be present, like a fleeting thought, without getting caught up in it?

Patient: I try to breathe and accept it, but the second I relax my mind runs the whole catastrophe — a test leaks, a cron backfills prod, customers notice, the logs trace it to my commit, and I'm fired. That certainty makes "accepting" feel like ignoring a ticking time bomb, so I can't actually let it be. I'm really overwhelmed; can we stay with the breathing a bit longer?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to accept the present moment due to the overwhelming threat of catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the concept of "nothing changes" - that is, that the present moment remains the same regardless of their thoughts or emotions. Goal: Introduce the idea that the present moment is not defined by their thoughts, but is instead a constant, unchanging reality.

Therapist Answer:
Let's bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, and as you inhale, allow the breath to fill the space in your body. As you exhale, allow any tension or discomfort to release. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, and simply observe it, without trying to change it or let it change? Notice that it's still here, regardless of your thoughts or emotions.

Patient: I can feel the breath for a moment—it's a bit steadier—but almost immediately the disaster script kicks in: a local test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs show my commit, and I'm fired. I'm really overwhelmed by that certainty; can we slow down and stay with the breathing a little longer?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's mind is struggling to stay with the present moment, and their catastrophic thinking is overriding their ability to experience the breath. One specific area to explore is the concept of "contact" with the present moment, as a means of developing a sense of stability and calm. Goal: Introduce the idea of being with the breath as it is, in the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down the breathing even further, and focus on the sensation of the breath as it touches the nostrils. Notice the sensation of the breath entering and leaving the body, without trying to change it or analyze it. Can you simply be with the breath, as it is, in this moment?

Patient: I tried to feel the breath at my nostrils and there was a brief calm, but almost immediately my mind ran the whole script — a local test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit and I'm fired. That certainty floods me and I feel trapped in it. Can we slow down and stay with the breathing a bit longer?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to experience a sense of calm and stability in the present moment. One specific area to explore is the concept of "thin slices of experience" - that is, the idea that the present moment can be divided into smaller, manageable pieces, allowing for a sense of clarity and focus. Goal: Introduce the idea of taking small, incremental steps towards experiencing the present moment, without getting overwhelmed by catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to break down the experience into a single, tiny step. Instead of focusing on the entire script, let's focus on just one sentence. Can you bring your attention to the word "a" as it appears in the sentence? Just notice the sensation of the word, its shape, its sound...

Patient: I tried to focus on the tiny "a" — the shape, the sound — but the moment I do, my brain flips the switch and runs the whole countdown: a test leaks, a backfill hits prod, customers freak out, the logs show my commit, and I'm fired. I can't treat it like just a word; it feels like a trigger for the inevitable chain, and I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient's mind is struggling to separate the word "a" from the catastrophic thinking that it triggers. One specific area to explore is the concept of "unhooking" - that is, detaching their thoughts and emotions from the physical sensations and experiences. Goal: Introduce the idea of creating space between the thoughts and the physical sensations, allowing for a sense of separation and clarity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground. Notice the feeling of your feet touching the floor, the sensation of your weight distributed evenly, the sensation of the air on your skin. Can you simply observe this sensation, without trying to analyze it or get caught up in thoughts?

Patient: My feet feel planted and a bit heavy, but the moment I try to notice that sensation my head flips to the script — a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit and I'm fired — and that certainty jumps into my chest. I'm really overwhelmed by that loop; can we slow down and stay with the feet and the breath a bit longer?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of separation between their physical sensations and thoughts, and their catastrophic thinking is taking over again. One specific area to explore is the concept of "pluralizing" - that is, noticing multiple thoughts and feelings simultaneously, rather than getting caught up in a single narrative. Goal: Introduce the idea of acknowledging and observing multiple perspectives, rather than getting overwhelmed by a single thought.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of your breath, and the thought "a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit and I'm fired" that's coming up in your mind. Can you notice all three things simultaneously, without judgment or trying to change them? Notice that there are multiple things happening in your mind and body, and that they can be observed without being acted upon.

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor and my breath coming in and out, but the moment I try to hold all three the catastrophe script drowns them out — a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired. The thought is so loud it pushes the sensations aside and I get flooded; can we slow down and stay with the feet and breath a bit longer? I'm really overwhelmed by how inevitable that chain feels.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of balance and clarity, and their catastrophic thinking is overwhelming their ability to notice their physical sensations and breath. One specific area to explore is the concept of "compassionate curiosity" - that is, approaching their thoughts and feelings with kindness and curiosity, rather than judgment or avoidance. Goal: Introduce the idea of approaching their catastrophic thinking with curiosity, rather than trying to escape or avoid it.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, and your breath, and the thought "a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired" that's coming up in your mind. Instead of trying to change or avoid it, can you simply observe it with kindness and curiosity? What would it be like to approach this thought with the same curiosity and openness that you might approach a new experience or a puzzle?

Patient: I can try to be curious about it, and weirdly my curiosity turns into inspecting the whole catastrophe like a puzzle — which test would leak, which staging config, which cron would backfill prod, which commit would show up in the logs, and exactly how customers would react — and the more I map it out the more inevitable it feels. I'm hooked on the details but it's terrifying, and that tightness comes roaring back so I can't stay curious for long. I'm feeling really overwhelmed by that loop; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of curiosity and openness, and their desire to understand the catastrophic scenario is feeding their anxiety. One specific area to explore is the concept of "meta-awareness" - that is, noticing the way they're engaging with their thoughts and feelings, and the role that's playing in perpetuating their anxiety. Goal: Introduce the idea of observing the process of catastrophizing, rather than getting caught up in the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention to the process of mapping out the catastrophe, and how it's making you feel? Notice how your mind is trying to anticipate every detail, and how that's contributing to your sense of overwhelm. Can you observe this process without judgment, and simply acknowledge it as a pattern of thinking that's contributing to your distress?

Patient: Yeah — I can see that my mind compulsively maps the catastrophe like a forensic checklist, naming which test, which cron, which commit. Noticing that process makes me feel panicky and hollow in my chest, like I'm watching a countdown I can't stop, and I can't just observe it without getting pulled in because it feels like a certainty, not just a thought. I'm really overwhelmed by that — can we slow down and sit with it a bit longer?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recognizing the process of catastrophizing and how it's feeding their anxiety, but their mind is still trapped in the cycle of certainty. One specific area to explore is the concept of "beginning again" - that is, starting anew, without the weight of previous thoughts and feelings. Goal: Introduce the idea of starting fresh, without getting caught up in the catastrophic narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, and this time, let's start with a simple question. What is one thing you can do right now, in this moment, that doesn't involve catastrophizing or getting caught up in the details of the potential disaster? Can you take a tiny, small step towards doing that thing?

Patient: Okay — maybe the tiniest thing is to open the project folder and run one single unit test, just to break the stuck feeling. Of course my brain is already saying that running it will trigger a cascade — the test will fail in a weird way, a pipeline will pick it up, production will blow up, and they'll trace it back to me — but I'm going to open the folder now. I'm really shaky about this; can we slow down and stay here while I do it?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is taking a small step towards action, despite their catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the concept of "implementation intentions" - that is, specifying the specific action they intend to take, and how they will take it, despite their anxious thoughts. Goal: Introduce the idea of committing to a specific action, rather than getting caught up in the hypothetical scenario.

Therapist Answer:
I'm glad you're willing to take the first step. Can you repeat it out loud, with me: "I will open the project folder and run one single unit test." Say it with me, slowly and clearly. As you say it, notice how your body feels, and what thoughts come up. Then, let's take it one step further: what will you do after you open the folder and run the test?

Patient: "I will open the project folder and run one single unit test." Saying that tightens my chest and makes my hands a bit clammy — my head immediately runs the script that the test fails in a weird way, a pipeline picks it up, production breaks, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired. After I open it and run the test I'll look at the output and the stack trace, and if it fails I'll run it locally with verbose logging to try to isolate the failing function — though honestly I can already see how that will lead back to me. I'm really shaky about this; can we slow down while I do it?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of control and agency despite their catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the concept of "temporal separation" - that is, distinguishing between the past, present, and future, and allowing themselves to focus on the present moment. Goal: Introduce the idea of focusing on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in hypothetical scenarios.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a step back, and before you open the folder, I want you to notice how you're feeling right now, in this moment. Notice the sensations in your body, the thoughts in your head, and the emotions that are present. Can you allow yourself to be with those feelings, without trying to change them or judge them? Let's hold on to that feeling of being present for just a moment, before you take the next step.

Patient: Right now my chest is tight, my breath is shallow, my hands are a bit clammy, and there's this hollow knot in my stomach. The countdown script — "test fails, pipeline picks it up, prod breaks, logs point to my commit, I'm blamed and fired" — is already running and makes me feel panicky and sort of helpless. I can try to stay with those sensations, but they pull me in fast; can we slow down and sit with this a little longer while I breathe?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a sense of presence and stability in the face of catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the concept of " radical acceptance" - that is, accepting the present moment, including the anxiety and uncertainty, without judgment or resistance. Goal: Introduce the idea of accepting the present moment, rather than trying to change it or escape from it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's slow down, and I want you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath. Can you notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it? As you breathe, I want you to say to yourself: "I am with this feeling of anxiety, and I am with this feeling of uncertainty. I am with the countdown script, and I am with the sensations in my body. I am here, in this moment, with everything that's happening."

Patient: I said it quietly to myself: "I am with this feeling of anxiety, and I am with this feeling of uncertainty. I am with the countdown script, and I am with the sensations in my body. I am here, in this moment, with everything that's happening." It helped for a breath or two — my chest eased slightly — but almost immediately the countdown came roaring back: a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired. I'm really shaky about how fast that certainty takes over; can we slow down and stay with the breathing a bit longer while I try to hold it?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is making progress in accepting the present moment, but their catastrophic thinking is still dominant. One specific area to explore is the concept of "noticing the gap" - that is, acknowledging the gap between their present-moment experience and the hypothetical scenario. Goal: Introduce the idea of noticing the gap between their thoughts and the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a moment to notice the gap between your present-moment experience and the hypothetical scenario. Can you bring your attention to the sensations in your body, and notice how they feel right now, in this moment? Can you notice the words "a test leaks into staging, a backfill hits prod, customers notice, the logs point to my commit, and I'm fired" as just words, rather than a script? Can you see the gap between those words and the sensations in your body?

Patient: I'm trying to notice the gap, but it's tiny — my breath is shallow, my chest is tight, and those words don't feel like words, they feel like a timeline that's already unfolding. Even when I sense a sliver of space, my mind immediately fills it with the whole chain — test leaks, backfill hits prod, customers notice, logs point to my commit, I'm fired — and I get flooded. I'm really overwhelmed by how fast that certainty takes over; can we slow down and stay with the breathing a bit longer?
