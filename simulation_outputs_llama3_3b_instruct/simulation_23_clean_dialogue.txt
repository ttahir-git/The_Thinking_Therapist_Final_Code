Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in these repetitive cycles of pretty brutal self-criticism whenever I perceive any kind of failure—especially after difficult romantic relationships, it’s like an old pattern reactivates. I can talk about it in clinical terms—conditional self-worth, maladaptive rumination—but what that actually looks like day-to-day is constant undermining of my confidence while I juggle school and persistent financial stress. I tend to intellectualize and analyze the feeling instead of letting myself sit with the sadness, which probably isn’t helping.

Therapist: Can you think of a time when you allowed yourself to feel the sadness or hurt after a difficult experience, without immediately analyzing it or trying to intellectualize it? What would it be like to sit with that feeling for just 5-10 breaths, without judgment or self-criticism?

Patient: Yeah—I can picture one night after a breakup when I sat on the kitchen floor and, for maybe a minute, let the grief be there instead of narrating it away. If I actually tried to sit with it for five to ten breaths, I think it would be a heavy pressure in the chest and a kind of queasy tightness in my stomach, and probably a weird vulnerability that feels both unfamiliar and risky. The problem is that my reflex is immediate meta-cognition—I start cataloguing causes, patterns, and possible interventions—so staying with the raw sensation feels foreign and a bit frightening, like stepping off a familiar path.

Therapist: What would happen to that pressure in your chest and queasy feeling in your stomach if, instead of trying to change it, you allowed yourself to simply notice it as a physical sensation, without judgment or trying to make sense of it? Would it feel like a bridge to something else, or would it remain stuck?

Patient: Theoretically, sustained, nonjudgmental attention to interoceptive signals should reduce limbic reactivity—so I’d expect the chest pressure and queasy stomach to attenuate a bit, maybe diffuse into a less urgent background sensation. Practically, if I actually let it sit for 5–10 breaths I think it would become more recognizable as sadness than as a threat, which could feel like a small bridge toward clarity rather than something stuck forever. But I’m also wary—there’s a strong part of me that fears if I really let it be, I’ll get overwhelmed and exposed, so I’d probably be monitoring the whole time and slipping back into analysis.

Therapist: Can you imagine taking a small step back from monitoring the physical sensations, just for a tiny fraction of a second, to see what happens? Not to try to change or analyze, but simply to notice what's present without judgment? What would it be like to have just a tiny bit of freedom from the urge to monitor and control?

Patient: I can picture it—a micro-loosening, like the ribcage un-clenching for a beat and the stomach queasiness diffusing into a duller background sensation. But my default is immediate meta-commentary—labeling it as autonomic downregulation and scanning for triggers—so that brief freedom would probably be interrupted by analysis within seconds. If I actually tried to hold it, I think a soft sadness would emerge, but I’m wary of getting flooded, so even imagining staying with it activates contingency plans and cognitive strategies.

Therapist: Can you imagine that you're willing to let the soft sadness emerge, without immediately trying to label it or analyze it? What would it be like to allow it to simply exist, without trying to change or respond to it, even if it feels uncomfortable or difficult? Would that allow for a different kind of understanding or insight?

Patient: In theory I can consent to that—treat it like a short experiment in affect tolerance—and I suspect letting the sadness exist would produce a different kind of data: less narrative blame and more raw information about what actually hurts. But pragmatically I'm skeptical of my capacity to stay put without defaulting to analysis; removing that analytic crutch feels risky, like stepping into ambiguity where I might get overwhelmed. If I did manage it, I think the insight would be quieter and more humane—something that reframes perceived failures as situational rather than moral defects.

Therapist: Can you imagine that this new understanding – that perceived failures are situational, not moral defects – being applied to a specific situation that's been causing you distress? For example, what would it be like to see your recent breakup not as a moral failure, but as a result of circumstances beyond your control? What would be the difference in how you experience and respond to the situation?

Patient: If I actually reframed the breakup as situational rather than moral, the immediate effect would probably be less corrosive shame—the inner critic would have less ammo, so that tightness in my chest might ease into a quieter sadness instead of full-blown self-condemnation. Cognitively, I'd shift from global verdicts like "I'm defective" to more specific hypotheses about timing, incompatible needs, and external stressors, which makes problems feel solvable instead of existential. Behaviorally, that could mean I'm more likely to ask for practical support, not withdraw from future relationships out of fear, and focus on manageable steps (school, finances, boundaries) instead of punishing myself. I’m saying this in a pretty analytical way because I’m skeptical I could actually stay in that reframe—my reflex is to slip back into rumination—so I'd want simple, repeatable practices or scripts to test it in real time. Can we try one of those small exercises now? I'm a bit nervous about it, but curious.

Therapist: Let's try a simple exercise to help you practice this new perspective. I'd like you to notice the physical sensations in your body right now, without trying to label or analyze them. Just observe them as they are, without judgment. When you're ready, I'll guide you through a short, guided exercise to help you stay with the sensations and explore the possibility of reframing your experience.

Patient: Okay—I'm willing to try, though I'm nervous about getting flooded. Right now I notice a band-like tightness across my chest, a queasy pull in my stomach, and my breaths are pretty shallow; my shoulders feel held up. My reflex is already to start diagnosing it—'is this anxiety, shame, or exhaustion?'—but I'll try to just observe those sensations and let them be. Go ahead when you're ready.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through a short, guided exercise to help you stay with the sensations. I want you to focus on the tightness in your chest, the queasiness in your stomach, and the feeling of your shoulders being held up. Can you bring your attention to the sensation in your breath, noticing how it's connected to these physical sensations? Without trying to change or analyze anything, simply observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Just notice the sensation of the breath, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—when I bring attention to the breath it’s mostly high and shallow, like the inhale barely moves my ribs and the exhale doesn’t release fully, and my shoulders stay up. As I try not to analyze it my reflex kicks in and I start theorizing about autonomic arousal and interoceptive avoidance, which pulls me out of simply noticing. I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed—could we slow down and do a couple of guided, slow breaths together?

Therapist: Let's slow down and take a few deep, slow breaths together. Inhale for a count of four, and hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four, and hold again for a count of four. As we breathe in, I want you to bring your attention to the sensation in your body, without trying to change or analyze it. Simply notice how the breath is moving in and out of your body, and see what happens in your body as you breathe. When you're ready, we can continue.

Patient: Okay—I did one cycle. On the inhale my shoulders still shot up and the band across my chest tightened; during the hold there's this prickly buzz and a reflex thought that I’m hyperventilating; on the exhale there was a small, maybe 10% easing, and the second hold felt awkward and a little lightheaded. I can actually sense a tiny softening in the queasiness when I stop narrating, but my mind immediately catalogs it as a transient autonomic fluctuation and pulls me out. Can we do two more cycles but without the holds? Or if you prefer to keep the counts, could you coach me through resisting the urge to label each sensation while we breathe?

Therapist: Let's do two more cycles without the holds. I'll guide you through the breathing, and I want you to focus on the sensations in your body, without trying to change or analyze them. As we breathe in, notice the sensation in your body, without judgment. Just observe how the breath is moving in and out of your body. When you exhale, notice how your body feels, without trying to label or understand it. Let's do this together, slowly and carefully. Inhale...

Patient: Inhale — my ribs lift a bit, my shoulders still creep up but maybe a notch less.  
Exhale — there’s a small loosening across the chest and the queasiness in my stomach dulls a hair, but of course my mind immediately slaps a label on it (partial vagal downregulation) and I resent that reflex.  
I can do another cycle; could you keep guiding me with just simple cues? I’m nervous but willing to keep going.

Therapist: Inhale... notice the sensation in your body...
Exhale... allow the sensation to be, without judgment or trying to change it...
Continue...

Patient: Exhale — there’s a slight unclenching across the chest and the stomach queasiness dulls; the urgency feels a bit smudged at the edges. My reflex still wants to annotate it as “partial vagal downshift,” but underneath that I can actually feel a small, awkward tenderness — a sadness that isn’t just data to be solved. I’m nervous about staying with it, so can we do a few more slow breaths with your simple cues, and then maybe try a short script I can use when the inner critic starts lecturing?

Therapist: Inhale... notice the sensation in your body...
Exhale... allow the sensation to be, without judgment or trying to change it...
Exhale... continue...
When you notice your inner critic starting to talk, I want you to take a moment to say to yourself: "This thought is my experience, not my identity. I can observe it, without judgment."

Patient: I did—"This thought is my experience, not my identity." Saying it lowered the critic's volume a bit and let a small, awkward tenderness surface underneath the analysis. Of course I'm already framing that as a defusion technique and wondering about recall in high-arousal moments, so I'm skeptical but curious. Could you help me shape a very short, pragmatic script—one or two lines—that I can actually remember when the inner critic starts up? And can we do a couple more slow breaths after that?

Therapist: Let's try to condense the script into a shorter phrase that you can easily remember. How about: "I see this thought, I don't own it"? You can repeat it to yourself when your inner critic starts up.
Inhale... notice the sensation in your body...
Exhale... allow the sensation to be, without judgment or trying to change it...
Exhale... continue...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Saying "I see this thought, I don't own it" feels a little abstract, like another label to file away rather than something that actually shifts the feeling. 

Inhale — chest tightens;  
Exhale — a tiny softening, the phrase lowered the critic's volume a notch, but underneath it still feels theoretical. 

Could we try a shorter, more concrete script I can actually remember, like "Thought — not fact"? And yeah, let's do two more slow breaths using that phrase.

Therapist: Let's try a new script: "Thought — not fact". This is a simple and concrete way to remind yourself that thoughts are not necessarily reflections of reality. Inhale... notice the sensation in your body...
Exhale... "Thought — not fact"... breathe...
Exhale... continue...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying a phrase supposed to shift the feeling rather than just label it?  

Inhale — chest tightens;  
Exhale — I said "Thought — not fact" quietly and the critic's volume dropped a notch, but underneath it still feels like an abstract maneuver rather than an actual change in the ache.  

Maybe a crisper, more somatic cue would work for me, something like "Thought — not me" or even just "Not true." Can we try two more slow breaths where I say one of those out loud, and then test which one actually interrupts the loop for more than a second? I want to see a concrete difference, not just another conceptual tweak.

Therapist: Let's try the phrase "Not true" and say it out loud as we breathe. Inhale... "Not true"... exhaled slowly... 
Inhale... "Not true"... exhaled slowly... 
Inhale... "Not true"... exhaled slowly... 

Note: Observe how your body responds to the phrase "Not true". Does it feel like a gentle shock, a subtle release, or a more profound shift in tension?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying "Not true" supposed to produce a bodily change rather than just relabeling the thought?

That said, I tried it aloud with a breath and it produced a small, almost electric jolt that loosened the band across my chest maybe 10–20% for a few seconds; the queasy stomach dampened a hair but rebounded quickly. It feels like a transient cognitive defusion—salience drops briefly, then the critic reasserts itself—so I'm skeptical about durability.

Can we try pairing "Not true" with a somatic anchor (like pressing thumb and forefinger together or a longer sigh on the exhale) and do three more slow breaths to compare effects? Also, can we rate the intensity before and after on a 0–10 scale so it's less abstract? I want to see concrete, repeatable differences.

Therapist: Let's try pairing "Not true" with a somatic anchor, such as pressing your thumb and forefinger together, and doing three more slow breaths. I'll ask you to rate the intensity of the physical sensations in your body before and after, on a 0-10 scale, to help us compare the effects.

Please go ahead and do the exercise, and when you're ready, we'll rate the intensity afterwards.

Patient: Before I did it: chest tightness about 7/10, stomach queasiness 6/10, overall anxiety around 7/10.  

I pressed my thumb and forefinger together, took three slow inhales, and on each exhale I said "Not true" quietly while keeping the pressure between my fingers. Each exhale produced a small, almost electric loosen — like a 1–2 point drop in the chest for a few seconds. Right after the set: chest felt about 5/10, stomach 4/10, overall anxiety ~5/10. The effect was real but transient — after about 20–30 seconds the critic's voice crept back and ratings nudged up (chest to ~6/10).  

Observations: the tactile anchor actually helps interrupt the loop more than words alone; saying "Not true" gives a brief cognitive defusion but pairing it with touch lengthened that window. I’m skeptical about how durable this is under higher stress, and I’m worried I’ll forget to do it when I’m triggered.  

Can we try one of two things next: (1) practice a longer sequence now to see if the effect accumulates, or (2) develop an ultra-brief portable script+anchor I can use in real time (one line + one action) and rehearse it a couple times? I’m a bit nervous but willing to keep going.

Therapist: Let's try to practice a longer sequence to see if the effect accumulates. I'd like you to repeat the process of pressing your thumb and forefinger together, saying "Not true" quietly on each exhale, and noticing the physical sensations in your body before and after. Let's start with three more cycles and see if the effect builds.

As we practice, I'll also help you develop a portable script and anchor. We can work on creating a one-line phrase and one simple action that you can use in real-time when you feel triggered.

Patient: Before this set: chest tightness ~6/10, stomach queasy ~5/10, overall anxiety ~6/10. I did three cycles pressing thumb+forefinger, saying “Not true” on each exhale, and lengthening the exhale into a small sigh.

After the three: chest ~4/10, stomach ~3/10, overall anxiety ~4/10 — so it did accumulate a bit more than the earlier brief set, and the window of relief stretched to maybe 40–60 seconds before the critic crept back up. Observations: the tactile anchor plus a slightly longer exhale gives a more somatic interruption than words alone; saying the phrase still feels a bit conceptual, but paired with touch and breath it has a measurable effect. I’m skeptical about durability in high-stress moments and worried I’ll forget it when triggered, but I’m willing to practice.

For a one-line portable script + action I’d like to try this ultra-brief option: say silently or aloud, “Not true,” while pressing thumb and forefinger together and doing one slow, full exhale (a long sigh). It’s short, motor-based, and repeatable. Can we rehearse that three times now, and then brainstorm simple reminders I could use in daily life so I don’t forget when I'm triggered? I want to keep going with more practice — a longer sequence or a short plan for real-world use would feel helpful.

Therapist: Let's rehearse the ultra-brief script and action three times. I'll guide you through it, and then we'll brainstorm some simple reminders to help you remember to use it when you're triggered.

Please repeat the exercise: silently or aloud, "Not true," while pressing your thumb and forefinger together and doing one slow, full exhale (a long sigh). 

(Note: I'll provide feedback and guidance as you practice. When you're ready, we'll move on to brainstorming simple reminders to help you remember to use the tool in daily life.)

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is repeating it now supposed to make it stick later? Still, I did the three reps.

Cycle 1: pressed thumb+forefinger, long exhale saying "Not true" — chest loosened maybe 10%, stomach eased a bit, critic quieted for ~20s.  
Cycle 2: repeated — another incremental softening, chest down another point or two, felt a slightly bigger sigh-release.  
Cycle 3: after the third, chest ~4/10 (from ~6), stomach ~3/10, overall anxiety ~4/10; the effect accumulated but still drifts back after ~30–60s. I remain skeptical about durability, but the somatic anchor clearly helps interrupt the loop.

Simple reminders I could realistically use in daily life:  
- Wrist cue (rubber band or ring) I can press when triggered.  
- Phone alarm or lock-screen note that says “Not true.”  
- Habit-stacking: do the anchor after brushing teeth or making coffee.  
- Sticky note on my laptop/wallet or a keychain tag.  
- Short voice memo labeled “Not true” I can play once.  
- Daily 1-minute rehearsal in the morning so it becomes procedural.

Can we pick one reminder to try implementing now and rehearse it a couple times, or would you recommend a different rehearsal strategy? I’m nervous but willing to keep going.

Therapist: Let's choose one reminder and rehearse it a few times. I recommend the habit-stacking approach, where you associate the anchor with a daily routine, such as brushing your teeth or making coffee. This can help make the reminder more automatic and increase the chances of consistent use.

Let's start with habit-stacking. I'd like you to rehearse the following sequence: brush your teeth, press your wrist with the rubber band or ring, and say "Not true" silently or aloud while taking a deep breath. We'll practice this sequence three times, and then you can start incorporating it into your daily routine.

Patient: I can’t actually brush my teeth here, so I rehearsed the sequence mentally/physically three times using a ring on my wrist as the anchor. Before starting my baseline felt like chest ~6/10, stomach ~5/10; after cycle 1 it dropped to chest ~5, stomach ~4; after cycle 2 chest ~4, stomach ~3; after cycle 3 chest ~3, stomach ~2. Each rep felt like a brief, concrete interruption — the tactile cue plus the exhale made the shift more somatic than the phrase alone — but the relief still drifts back after 30–60 seconds unless I repeat it.

I’m skeptical about how this will hold up in a real trigger (I worry I’ll forget the sequence or default to analysis), but habit-stacking feels plausible: sticking a rubber band on my toothbrush or putting a ring on the bedside lamp could be a practical prompt. Can we draft a tight implementation intention together — something like, "If I feel the inner critic, then I press my ring and do one long exhale while saying 'Not true' " — and rehearse that exact wording a few times? I’m nervous about ritualizing this but willing to keep going and practice.

Therapist: Let's draft a tight implementation intention together. Based on your previous words, I propose the following wording:

"If I feel the inner critic, then I press my ring and do one long exhale while saying 'Not true'."

We'll rehearse this exact wording a few times to make it feel more automatic and confident.

Here's how we can phrase it: "If I feel the critic, then I use the 'Not true' anchor." We can say this out loud, and then practice pressing the ring and taking a long exhale. Let's try it together a few times, and then you can start incorporating it into your daily routine.

Please repeat the following phrase with me: "If I feel the critic, then I use the 'Not true' anchor."

Patient: "If I feel the critic, then I use the 'Not true' anchor."  
"If I feel the critic, then I use the 'Not true' anchor."  
"If I feel the critic, then I use the 'Not true' anchor."

Saying it aloud while visualizing pressing the ring and doing a long exhale produced a small, concrete shift — chest eased a bit — but I remain skeptical about automaticity and durability; it feels like a useful implementation intention to proceduralize, though. Can we rehearse this exact sequence a few more times and then set a simple morning micro-practice (30–60 seconds) so it has a better chance of becoming habitual? I'm a bit anxious about ritualizing it, but I'm willing to keep going.

Therapist: Let's rehearse the sequence a few more times to build confidence. Then, we'll establish a simple morning micro-practice to help solidify the new habit.

Please rehearse the sequence three more times, and then we'll set up a morning micro-practice.

(Rehearsal repetition: 3 x)

After rehearsing, we'll schedule a specific time each morning to practice the sequence for 30-60 seconds. For example, we can set a reminder to practice this sequence as soon as you wake up, or during your morning coffee break. Which option works best for you?

(Next steps: scheduling and establishing a morning micro-practice routine)

Patient: I did the three rehearsals: before the set chest ~3/10, stomach ~2/10; after the three reps chest ~1–2/10, stomach ~1/10 — so it does accumulate and gives a clearer window of relief, though it still drifts back after a minute or so. I prefer the morning-coffee option for the micro-practice (feels easier to habit-stack than immediately on waking), and I'm willing to set a phone reminder for 30–60 seconds right after I make my coffee. 

I'm not sure I follow how a morning-only practice reliably transfers to unpredictable triggers—how does rehearsing in a safe context help when the critic ambushes me mid-lecture or during a bill call? Can we rehearse the exact micro-practice now a couple more times and draft a very tiny cue I can put on my phone lock screen to help bridge the gap? I want to keep working on this.

Therapist: Let's rehearse the micro-practice a couple more times to build confidence. Then, we'll draft a tiny cue to help you bridge the gap between morning practice and unpredictable triggers.

Please rehearse the micro-practice two more times, just like before. After that, we'll work on creating a tiny cue to help you apply the "Not true" anchor in different contexts.

(Rehearsal repetition: 2 x)

After rehearsing, we'll draft a tiny cue. Can you think of a word, symbol, or gesture that you can quickly glance at or use as a prompt when the critic ambushes you? This could be something as simple as a smiley face 🙂 or a small emoji, or a specific hand gesture.

Patient: I did the two rehearsals: before them chest ~3/10, stomach ~2/10; after both reps chest ~1–2/10, stomach ~1/10 — so it still accumulates but is short-lived. For a tiny cue I’m leaning toward a discreet tactile/visual combo: the thumb+forefinger press or rubbing my ring as the in-the-moment anchor, plus a minimalist lock-screen cue like a single dot • or the two-word prompt “Not true” so it’s unambiguous. I’m skeptical—abstract symbols feel like just another concept—but a physical action feels more likely to interrupt the loop when I’m stressed. Can we rehearse the ring+dot combo now a few times and draft the exact lock-screen wording/symbol so I can set it up and start the morning micro-practice tomorrow? I’m nervous about ritualizing this, but I want to keep working on the transfer piece.

Therapist: Let's rehearse the ring+dot combo a few times to solidify it. Then, we'll draft the exact lock-screen wording and symbol for your phone.

Please rehearse the ring+dot combo three more times, using the minimalist dot • or the two-word prompt "Not true". Pay attention to the physical sensations in your body and the level of tension in your chest and stomach.

(Rehearsal repetition: 3 x)

After rehearsing, we'll draft the exact lock-screen wording and symbol. For the lock-screen cue, I recommend something simple and clear, like:

Lock screen: • or Not true

This will ensure that you can quickly glance at the cue and interrupt the inner critic when needed. We'll set it up on your phone tomorrow and start the morning micro-practice.

Patient: I did the three rehearsals. Baseline before the set: chest ~3/10, stomach ~2/10; after the three reps: chest ~1–2/10, stomach ~1/10 — so the ring+dot combo still produces an incremental, somatic downshift, though it’s short-lived. I’m skeptical about durability under real stress, but it’s the most concrete tool I’ve felt so far.

Lock‑screen cue I’ll use: “• Not true” — the dot as a quick visual nudge plus the two-word prompt. I’ll put a rubber ring on my coffee mug and set a phone reminder for 30–60 seconds right after I make coffee tomorrow for the micro‑practice.

Can we do one practical thing next: run a brief simulated trigger now (you name a realistic prompt) so I can practice the exact sequence in-context and we can tweak the pocket script? I want to rehearse transfer—“If the critic starts, then press my ring, exhale, say ‘Not true’”—but I’m nervous about ritualizing it and want to test how it holds up in a more triggering moment.
