Patient: I'm in my early sixties, a manager, and lately I've been avoiding gatherings with friends because in social settings my mind turns into a fortune-telling machine — I just know I'll say something awkward, they'll laugh, the story will spread at work, I'll get passed over for promotions, my partner will get fed up and leave, and I'll end up alone. It feels completely inevitable; any other outcome just seems unrealistic. My partner's supportive, but that doesn't change how hooked I am by these disaster stories.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like you'll say something awkward in social situations? Is it a fear of making a mistake or a fear of being judged?

Patient: I think it's mostly a fear of being judged — like if I flub a line or say something odd, people will instantly decide I'm incompetent. My brain then races: they'll laugh, the story will spread at work, I'll be written off for the next promotion, my partner will get tired of defending me and leave, and I'll be isolated. I know it sounds extreme, but arguing for anything calmer in my head just feels pointless and makes me more anxious.

Therapist: What would happen if you allowed yourself to have a small, awkward moment in a social situation, without immediately catastrophizing? For example, if you flub a line, what would be the worst that could happen? Would it truly be a reflection of your competence?

Patient: Honestly, if I flub a line I can picture them laughing, someone filming it, it getting around at work, people treating me like a joke, me getting passed over, and my partner finally getting fed up and leaving — it's like a domino effect I can't stop. Thinking that people will just shrug it off feels like pretending nothing's wrong; my head won't accept the calmer outcome. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't make myself believe a small awkward moment wouldn't turn into something huge.

Therapist: Can you observe your mind's tendency to take the worst-case scenario without you actively participating in it? What if, instead of being the originator of this catastrophic story, you simply noticed it as a thought, without judgment or identification?

Patient: I can try to notice it, but the minute I label it a "thought" the fortune-telling machine just revs louder and I'm right back picturing the laugh, the video, getting written off at work, and my partner leaving — like it grabs me and won't let go. It feels impossible to just watch it without joining in; telling myself it's "just a thought" sounds naive and actually makes me more anxious. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a break from exploring the catastrophic scenario for now. Can you sit with the physical sensation of anxiety in your body, without trying to label or analyze it? What's the sensation in your chest, shoulders, or stomach?

Patient: When I try to sit with it, my chest tightens like someone's squeezing a fist there, my stomach ties itself in knots and I get this hollow queasy feeling, my shoulders hunch up and my breathing goes shallow and quick. My hands get a bit clammy and my head feels foggy, like everything's louder and faster. The second I notice those sensations the fortune-telling machine just cranks up and I start picturing the worst again, so I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on your breath, rather than trying to address the thoughts or physical sensations. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or analyze it?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to bring my attention to the breath — it's shallow in my chest and barely moving in my belly, quick and clipped. The fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I actually relax I'll faint or make a scene and then the whole awful chain will happen, so my shoulders tense and the breath speeds up. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by that — can we slow down a little?

Therapist: Let's take a small step back and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can to breathe, without judgment. Can you simply allow the breath to be as it is, without trying to control it or change it, just for this moment?

Patient: Okay — I tried to just let it be for a few breaths and, for a second, my chest felt a little less tight and my belly actually moved, which was almost like a tiny relief. But then the fortune-telling machine yelled that if I relax it'll all go wrong — I'll fumble, people will notice I'm "weird," they'll whisper, it'll get back to work, and everything will crash down — so my shoulders shot up and I went right back to panicking. I'm getting overwhelmed by that — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's focus on the physical sensation of the tiny relief you experienced earlier, rather than the thoughts that followed. Can you revisit that feeling of your chest relaxing and your belly moving, without trying to analyze or justify it?

Patient: I try to go back to that tiny relief — my chest softened and my belly actually moved for a few breaths, and it felt almost like a quiet space. But the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that if I let that happen I'll look odd, someone will notice, they'll laugh, someone will film it, it'll spread at work and ruin everything. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take another small step back. Can you simply acknowledge the physical sensation of your chest feeling softer and your belly moving, without trying to connect it to any particular outcome or meaning?

Patient: Okay — I can notice my chest softening and my belly moving, and it actually feels like a tiny quiet spot. But I can't keep from tying it to a story: the second I relax I just see people noticing, laughing, it spreading at work and everything falling apart. I'm getting overwhelmed by that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you take a pause, and simply look at the phrase "it spreads at work" as just a phrase, without adding a narrative to it? What happens if you let the thought be just a phrase, without linking it to a story or outcome?

Patient: I try, but the moment I look at "it spreads at work" it stops being a phrase and my head strings it into the whole disaster — people laughing, a clip circulating, my reputation crushed, promotions gone, my partner leaving. I'm getting overwhelmed by that — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on the thought, can you simply say the phrase "it spreads at work" out loud, without adding any meaning or narrative to it? Just the words themselves, without judgment or interpretation.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's saying it out loud supposed to help? Okay: "it spreads at work." The second I say it my brain stitches the whole catastrophe together—laughs, a clip, being written off, losing promotions, my partner leaving—so it just feels useless and I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a gentle invitation. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say the phrase "it spreads at work" again, but this time, before you say the words, pause for just a moment, and then just say "it" – just the single word "it".

Patient: ...it.

Saying it didn't make the story any smaller — the machine jumped on it and stitched the whole catastrophe back together, and now I feel kind of drained and fuzzy about what's supposed to happen next. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge your feeling of being drained. Can you notice where in your body you're holding tension, and allow that tension to be exactly as it is, without trying to change it or let it go?

Patient: It's a heavy tightness across my chest, up into my shoulders, and my jaw's clenched. I'm trying to let that weight just be there without doing anything to it, and it feels dull and kind of numb, but of course the fortune-telling machine immediately starts spinning a new disaster and my chest tightens again. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently say "not tight" to the sensation in your chest, shoulders, and jaw. Can you allow the sensation to be "not tight" for just a moment, without trying to change it or add to it?

Patient: Okay — I breathed out and quietly said "not tight." For a beat my chest nudged softer, but then the fortune-telling machine yelled that if I let my guard down I'll look weak, someone will notice and laugh, it'll spread at work and wreck everything, and now I just feel wiped and kind of fuzzy. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's focus on your breath again. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to analyze it or label it? Simply notice the sensation of the breath, as it is, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing the breath, but it's thin and mostly in my chest, just a faint in-and-out. For a beat it steadies and that feels almost calm, then the fortune-telling machine yells the same story — they'll laugh, someone will film it, it'll spread at work and ruin everything — and my shoulders lock up again. I'm feeling wiped and fuzzy and getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Can you gently acknowledge the phrase "they'll laugh, someone will film it, it'll spread at work and ruin everything" as just a phrase, without judgment or interpretation? Just acknowledge it as a phrase, without adding to it or letting it become a narrative.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I try to see it as just words, but the moment I read "they'll laugh, someone will film it..." my head stitches it into the whole catastrophe again — laughing, a clip, my reputation ruined. I feel kind of fuzzy and worn out by it, and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "Okay" to yourself. Just say "Okay" to the present moment, without judgment or interpretation. Allow the sound of your own voice to be just the sound of "Okay".

Patient: Okay.

Saying "Okay" made a tiny pause, like a little crack of quiet, but the fortune-telling machine immediately slammed back in—people laughing, someone filming, it spreading at work, my reputation wrecked, promotions gone, my partner leaving. I feel drained and fuzzy and I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very small, gentle step. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of your feet on the floor? Just notice the sensation of your feet being grounded in the present moment.

Patient: My feet feel planted, a little heavy and cool against the floor for a moment, like something steady. But even that tiny anchor gets swallowed—the fortune-telling machine immediately starts the whole scene again (people noticing, laughing, a clip spreading at work and everything falling apart), and I'm wiped and fuzzy and getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very small, gentle invitation. Can you take a tiny step back, and look around the room, just for a moment, without judgment or focus. Notice the sights, the sounds, the sensation of the air on your skin.

Patient: Okay — the light through the window is soft, I can hear a low hum from the vents, and the air feels cool on my forearms. But even noticing that, the fortune-telling machine is already replaying them laughing, a clip going around, it spreading at work and wrecking everything. I'm feeling fuzzy and kind of spaced — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very small, gentle exercise. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, just for a moment, without trying to analyze it or change it? Can you simply be with the sensation of the breath, without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to follow; the breath's thin and shallow, and for a second it steadies and that feels a little quieter, but the fortune-telling machine immediately screams they'll laugh, someone will film it, it'll spread at work and ruin everything. I'm wiped and fuzzy and pretty distracted, and it's getting overwhelming — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge your effort to try to focus on the breath. Can you acknowledge that it's okay if your mind wanders, and that it's not your fault that the catastrophic thinking is still present?

Patient: Okay... I'll try: it's okay if my mind wanders, and it's not my fault. Saying that helps for a second, but it doesn't stop the pictures — I still see them laughing, a clip, it spreading at work and wrecking everything. I'm feeling wiped and fuzzy and getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very gentle and subtle invitation. Can you simply notice the sensation of your body being present in the chair, without trying to change it or analyze it? Notice the sensation of your back against the chair, the sensation of your feet on the floor, the sensation of your body being here, in this moment.

Patient: My back's pressed into the chair and my feet feel a bit heavy on the floor — there's a little anchor there, but barely. The fortune-telling machine immediately starts up again — them laughing, a clip, it spreading at work and everything collapsing — and I'm feeling really wiped and fuzzy. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very small, gentle invitation. Can you allow the sensation of your body being present in the chair to be exactly as it is, without judgment or analysis? Can you simply accept that your back is pressed into the chair, your feet are heavy on the floor, and that's okay?

Patient: Okay — my back's pressed into the chair and my feet are heavy, and that actually feels a tiny bit... okay for a moment. But the fortune-telling machine immediately jumps in: if I let that be, they'll notice, laugh, someone will film it, it'll spread at work and wreck everything — I'm wiped and fuzzy and getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say "it is". Just say "it is" to the present moment, without judgment or analysis. Allow the words to simply be "it is".

Patient: "It is."

That little pause felt thin and almost helpful, but the fortune-telling machine cut in right away — people laughing, someone filming it, it spreading at work, my reputation wrecked, promotions gone, my partner leaving. I'm kind of drained and fuzzy and not even sure that did anything useful — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something very different. Can you take a deep look around the room, without trying to focus on anything in particular? Just look at the room, at the space around you, without judgment or analysis. Notice the colors, the shapes, the textures.

Patient: Okay — the walls are a kind of muted beige, a scuffed wooden bookshelf, a blue chair with frayed fabric, sunlight making a pale strip on the carpet. The moment I take it in my brain stitches it to the story — them noticing the chair, laughing at me, a clip of my awkwardness, it spreading at work and wrecking everything — I can't stop it. I'm feeling wiped and fuzzy and not sure how looking around helps — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try a very gentle and subtle invitation. Can you notice the sensation of your gaze on the room, without judgment or analysis? Can you simply be with the sensation of looking, without trying to connect it to the catastrophic story? Notice the sensation of your eyes on the objects in the room, without thinking "this is about me" or "this will happen to me".

Patient: I can try — my eyes feel a bit heavy and my gaze sort of skims the edges of things, like the room is blurry at the edges. But the fortune-telling machine snaps on and turns that into them noticing me, laughing, a clip spreading at work and wrecking everything. I'm feeling wiped and fuzzy and kind of distracted — can we slow down?
