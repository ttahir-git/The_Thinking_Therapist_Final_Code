--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a social worker in my mid-fifties and lately I can't stop getting furious about money — every time a bill shows up I see it as the first step in a chain that will definitely end with me losing the house and everything else. That prediction grabs me and fuels this tight anger during calls or meetings, and I can't imagine any other outcome; saying it won't happen just feels unrealistic. I end up snapping at people even though I'm usually quiet and cautious.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient expresses intense anger and fear about money, and sees a catastrophic outcome. Core emotion is frustration. Goal: Explore the tangible context of the "chain" of bills and how it relates to the patient's values.

Therapist Answer:
That makes sense. It sounds like when you see a bill, you feel like it's a domino effect, and you're worried that it'll snowball into a bigger problem. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers this sense of certainty in your mind?

Patient: Usually it's something small—an email about a bill, a text from the bank, or an unexpected expense—that flips a switch and suddenly I'm convinced it's the start of a downward spiral. My head immediately writes the worst-case script—missed payment, creditor calls, utilities cut, eviction, losing everything—and that sequence feels like a sure thing, so I tighten up and snap at whoever's nearest. If you suggest other outcomes I just don't buy it; that feels like wishful thinking and doesn't match the pattern I keep seeing.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient describes a pattern of catastrophic thinking and an avoidance behavior (sneezing at others) due to perceived irreversibility. Theme: fusion with the worst-case scenario. Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle by exploring the value of acting as if the "worst-case" hasn't happened.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and controlled by this worst-case scenario. Can you think of one small, everyday action you could take today that would be a tiny step towards making sure you don't lose your house? For example, what's one tiny thing you could do right now to take care of the situation, rather than getting caught up in the worst-case story?

Patient: I guess the tiniest thing I could do right now is log into my bank and actually read the bill to see what's due and when. But even that feels like opening a trap—if there's less wiggle room than I fear it'll prove my worst-case script is already starting, and if I call the bank to ask for help they'll probably refuse and that'll set off the chain anyway.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is hesitant to take small action due to fear of being caught in the worst-case scenario and is using defusion to protect themselves. Goal: Create space from the sticky thought (defusion) by exploring the value of action despite perceived uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
I get it, that feeling of being trapped is really strong. Can you try to imagine what would happen if you did take a small step, like looking at the bill, and it wasn't as bad as you thought? What if, in that moment, you could acknowledge that the worst-case scenario isn't set in stone, and you could take a breath and respond to the situation with more clarity?

Patient: I can't really picture it going any other way—if it's a little better now my head says that's just a lull before the next bigger bill, and then the bank will tighten up and the whole creditor-utility-eviction sequence will start for sure. If I called the bank, they'd refuse any help, they'd report me, and that would set everything in motion; that feels like the only realistic script. I'm trying to imagine breathing and being calm, but it's hard—I'm getting frustrated with myself and with this whole pattern, can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to disentangle from the worst-case scenario and is experiencing self-criticism. Theme: fusion with the narrative of being trapped. Goal: Introduce mindfulness as a means to create space from the story.

Therapist Answer:
I see. It sounds like you're really struggling with this sense of being trapped and frustrated with yourself. Can you try bringing your attention to your breath, just for a few deep breaths, and notice what's happening in your body when you think about this scenario? Sometimes, when we're feeling stuck, our bodies can get really tense. What do you notice in your body right now?

Patient: My chest's tight, my shoulders are up by my ears, my stomach's in a knot and my jaw's clenched — my breath's shallow and my hands feel cold. That physical stuff feels like proof to me that the dominoes are already falling and the whole collapse is inevitable, which just makes the anger hotter. I'm getting frustrated with myself and with this pattern — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing physical tension and fusion with the worst-case scenario. Goal: Introduce mindfulness and create space from the physical sensations to reduce fusion.

Therapist Answer:
It makes sense. Your body is really tense, and that can fuel the anger and feeling of being trapped. I want to slow down with you, and I'm not looking for a quick fix. Can we pause here for just a moment, and I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feeling the weight of your body in this chair?

Patient: I do feel my feet on the floor for a second, but even that feels like proof—like the weight is the first step toward being pushed out of the house, which then triggers the next awful thing. My chest's still tight and my mind won't stop racing through the whole eviction spiral. I'm getting frustrated with myself and with this—can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is experiencing fusion with the narrative of being pushed out and the physical sensations are reinforcing the worst-case scenario. Goal: Create space from the physical sensations and explore the process of defusion.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the physical sensations are getting tangled up with the story. Can you try to notice the sensations in your body, without trying to make sense of them or attach them to the story? Instead, simply allow them to be there, like a gentle hum in the background, without judgment. What would it be like if you could observe them without judgment, just as they are?

Patient: I try — I can feel the tight chest and the shallow breath for a second, my feet on the floor — but the minute I notice it my mind yells that it's proof the dominoes are falling. That tightness just becomes the start of the eviction story and I can't hold it as "just a feeling." I'm getting frustrated with myself and with this; can we slow down and stay with the sensations a bit longer because they keep flipping into the disaster in my head.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain a non-judgmental awareness of their physical sensations. Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise to help cultivate a sense of curiosity and openness towards the sensations.

Therapist Answer:
I understand. Let's take a few more deep breaths together, and this time, I'd like you to repeat a simple phrase to yourself, just for your ears: "I am holding this sensation, and it is exactly as it is." Can you try that, and see what happens when you say it to yourself?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. "I am holding this sensation, and it is exactly as it is." For one breath it felt a little less sharp, but my brain immediately says that's just the calm before the creditors call, the utilities get shut off, and the eviction notices start arriving, and the anger snaps back. I'm getting frustrated with myself and with this—can we slow down and stay with it longer?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is slipping back into the narrative and fusion with the worst-case scenario. Goal: Create space from the narrative by exploring the value of observing the sensation, rather than trying to label or interpret it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take another deep breath together, and this time, I'd like you to focus only on the sensation in your chest, without trying to label it or attach it to the story. Just observe it, as if it's a curious object, like a rock or a leaf. What does it feel like, exactly, without any judgment or story?

Patient: It feels like a hard, heavy stone right behind my breastbone — cold, tight, and sitting there so I can barely take a full breath. I try to look at it like a rock, but the minute I do I sink into this shameful feeling like I’m back at that failure, and my brain immediately turns it into the eviction story so the anger flares. I’m getting frustrated with myself — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling with fusion with the narrative and shame. Goal: Introduce a value-based exploration to help the patient connect with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than shame and fusion.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're struggling to keep the sensation separate from the story. Let's try something different. What is it about that feeling that you value most - the feeling of being a certain way, or the feeling of being in control? What would happen if, for just a moment, you let go of the story, and just focused on the sensation, without judgment or shame?

Patient: I guess I hold onto that stone because it feels like control — if I can predict the collapse, I can brace for it. Letting go feels like wishful thinking, like pretending I didn't already fail once, and the second I try to just notice the chest that shame wells up and pulls me straight into the eviction script. I'm getting anxious and overwhelmed — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to separate the desire for control from the narrative of shame and failure. Goal: Introduce a values-based exercise to help the patient connect with their core values and values-driven action.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're trying to hold onto control as a way to prevent the feelings of shame and failure. Can you think of a time when you felt truly in control, and it felt good? What were you doing, and what were you valuing in that moment? Is there a small step you could take right now, in this moment, that feels like it's aligned with what's important to you?

Patient: I remember when I organized a small emergency fund at work and negotiated with a vendor so a family’s utilities didn't get cut — I was meticulous with the numbers and felt steady and competent. A tiny step that would feel aligned with that is just making a one-line list of bills and due dates right now, nothing more. But the minute I think of doing it my brain says that list will prove there's no way out and that will trigger the creditor calls and the eviction for sure — I can't make myself believe otherwise. I'm feeling shame about how this keeps happening and my chest's racing and I'm getting anxious and frustrated with myself; can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is recalling a past success and attempting to connect with a similar sense of competence and control. Goal: Introduce a small, action-oriented exercise to help the patient build momentum and confidence.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're getting close to making a tiny step towards taking control. Before we do that, I want to make sure you're feeling okay with where you are right now. Can you take another deep breath with me, and just notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the sensation of the present moment? When you're ready, let's take that tiny step together: can you simply write down the list of bills and due dates on a piece of paper in front of you, without judgment, without trying to change it, and just observe the sensation of putting pen to paper?

Patient: I started the list—pen to paper—and wrote the bills and due dates, but as I put each line down my chest clenched and shame just rose up and made me jittery and unfocused. My mind keeps saying that list only proves there's no way out and that the creditor-utility-eviction chain is already set in motion, so the anger and panic spike again. I'm overwhelmed and can't steady myself right now—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer while I try to breathe?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with shame and defusion. Goal: Create space from shame and promote defusion.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're feeling overwhelmed and stuck. Let's take a break from the list for a moment and come back to it when you're feeling calmer. I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and that it doesn't mean you're failing. Can you take a few deep breaths with me, and when you're ready, I'd like you to look at the list again, but this time, I want you to say to it: "This list is just a list. It's just a piece of paper with some numbers and dates on it. It's not a prediction of what will happen. Can I say that to it, and let go of any judgment or story around it?"

Patient: I try to say that—"it's just a list"—but it rings hollow, like I'm pretending things aren't already falling apart. Shame floods in, that old failure feeling, my chest tightens and my mind immediately jumps to creditor calls and eviction. I don't trust that saying it will change anything right now; can we slow down and sit with this tightness a bit before I try it again?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling with shame and defusion, and the past failure is still influencing their ability to trust in the statement. Goal: Create space from shame and promote defusion.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that saying "it's just a list" feels like a kind of denial, and that's okay. It's okay to feel stuck and unsure. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that feeling. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your chest and shoulders, and allow it to be there, without trying to change it or push it away? Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and allow it to be a kind of anchor for you, a reminder that you're here, in this moment, with me.

Patient: I'm trying to focus on my chest and shoulders and the breath, but I'm not sure I follow how that's supposed to anchor me — it just feels a bit fuzzy and confusing. My chest is that same hard stone, shoulders tight, breath shallow, and the minute I notice it that old shame surges and my mind snaps into the eviction script like it's already underway. I'm anxious and distracted and can't hold this as an anchor right now—can we slow down and sit with the sensation a bit longer?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to find a sense of anchoring and defusion. Goal: Introduce a more concrete and experiential approach to help the patient cultivate a sense of calm and openness.

Therapist Answer:
I want to try something different. Can you try placing one hand on your chest, and the other hand on your stomach, with your fingers spread apart? This can help you feel more grounded and connected to your body. Now, I'd like you to bring your attention to the sensation in your chest, and as you do, I want you to say to it: "This sensation is just a sensation. It's not a story. It's not a prediction. It's just a feeling. Can you say that to it, and let it be?"

Patient: Okay—my right hand on my chest, left on my stomach. I say, "This sensation is just a sensation," but it hardly sticks; that stone in my chest just clenches and an old shame surges, and my brain immediately runs the creditor-utilities-eviction script like it's already happening. I'm jittery and distracted and saying it's "just a feeling" feels like pretending, which makes me angrier. Can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain defusion and is becoming angry with the feeling. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and non-judgmental approach to help the patient cultivate a sense of curiosity and openness.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that saying "just a feeling" is feeling like a kind of avoidance for you, and that's understandable. Let's try something simpler. Can you focus on your breath, and as you inhale, I want you to say to your chest: "I am feeling this sensation." As you exhale, I want you to say: "It is." Just observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and let the words be a gentle anchor for you. Don't try to change anything, just observe.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying those lines supposed to help? I tried it once just now—breath in, "I am feeling this sensation"—but it felt hollow; that stone in my chest clenched, shame surged like I'm back at that failure, and my mind immediately ran the creditor-utilities-eviction script so I couldn't hold the words as an anchor. I'm jittery and getting frustrated with myself—can we slow down and stay with the breath together a bit longer, maybe you guide me more slowly, because it keeps flipping into disaster.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to understand the value of the exercise and is becoming frustrated with the lack of progress. Goal: Simplify the exercise and guide the patient through a more mindful approach.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start again, slowly. Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you inhale, I'll say "inhale" and as you exhale, I'll say "exhale". Let's do it together: inhale... exhale... inhale... exhale... Let's focus on the sensation of the breath, and let's leave the words for now. Notice what happens when you focus on the breath, and we can try to add the words later, if you'd like.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that anchors me — I tried to breathe with you, but the minute I notice the breath my chest feels like that same hard stone and my head yells that this is just the quiet before the creditors call and the eviction notices start. It made me jittery and ashamed, like that old failure is right there, and I couldn't keep the breath as an anchor. Can we slow down and do it together more slowly, maybe you count or give me something concrete to focus on?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling with shame and defusion. Goal: Introduce a more concrete anchor to help the patient focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. I want you to focus on a specific sensation in your body, like the feeling of your hand on your chest. Can you focus on the sensation of your hand touching your chest, and notice the sensation of your fingers, the sensation of your skin, and the sensation of your chest against your hand? Just focus on that sensation, without trying to change it or think about anything else. Let's start with just 5 breaths, and I'll count them with you: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, notice your hand on your chest.

Patient: I did the five breaths and put my hand there, but it's the same heavy stone—cold and clenched—and that old shame surges and my head instantly runs the creditor‑utilities‑eviction script. It's all wearing me down and I can't steady myself; can we slow down and stay with the sensation longer? I'm getting frustrated with myself and it's hard to focus right now.


--- Turn 18 ---

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus and is becoming frustrated with the lack of progress. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach to help the patient build trust in the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that it's really hard for you to focus right now. Let's try something even simpler. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your fingers on your chest? Just focus on the sensation of your fingers touching your skin, and notice how that feels. I'll give you a gentle cue to help you stay focused: "Five... one... two... three... four... five." Let's start with just one breath, and I'll guide you through it: five... one...

Patient: Okay — I tried to focus on my fingers on my chest. They feel numb and a little cold, but the minute I notice it that shame from that old failure floods in and my head hijacks me with the creditor‑utilities‑eviction script, so I can't hold my attention; I'm jittery and spaced out and getting frustrated with myself. Can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer, maybe you guide me more slowly?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain focus and is becoming frustrated with the lack of progress. Goal: Introduce a more gradual and gentle approach to help the patient build trust in the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together, and I want you to focus on the sensation of your fingers on your chest. I'll guide you through it slowly. When I say "one", I want you to notice the sensation of your fingers touching your skin, and then I'll say "two". When I say "three", I want you to notice the sensation of your fingers feeling numb and cold. When I say "four", I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. And when I say "five", I want you to notice the sensation of your fingers on your chest, again. Ready? One...

Patient: One — I feel my fingers on my chest, numb and a little cold. Two — that numbness feels like proof. Three — shame wells up and that old failure sneaks in. Four — my breath's shallow, the stone's still there. Five — nothing's changed; my brain's already on the creditor→utilities→eviction loop and I'm worn out. Can we slow down and stay here a bit longer? I can't speed up right now.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to maintain focus and is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress. Goal: Introduce a more gentle and compassionate approach to help the patient build trust in the anchor.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that it's really tough for you to stay with it right now. I want you to know that it's okay to take a break, and we can come back to it when you feel ready. But before we do, I want to acknowledge how hard it is for you to sit with this sensation, and how much shame and frustration you're feeling. That takes a lot of courage. Can I give you a gentle nod of acknowledgment, and a gentle phrase that I want you to repeat to yourself: "I am sitting with this sensation, and it is okay to be here, exactly as I am."

Patient: Okay — I'll try it. "I am sitting with this sensation, and it is okay to be here, exactly as I am." Saying it for a breath felt like pretending; that old failure spikes up and the eviction story grabs me and my chest locks down. I'm worn out and can't do more right now — can we slow down and just stay here a bit longer?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to connect with the phrase and is becoming increasingly worn out. Goal: Explore the value of simply being present in the moment, without the need for a specific anchor or outcome.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the phrase felt like a stretch for you, and that's okay. Let's try something different. I want you to just be here, exactly as you are, without trying to do anything or achieve a specific state. Can you simply be with your breath, your body, and your thoughts, without judgment or attachment? Let's just sit in silence for a moment, and see what happens. No trying, no striving, no achieving. Just being.

Patient: I'll try to just be, but my brain won't stop narrating the eviction story — missed payment, collector calls, utilities cut, eviction — like it's already happening and will definitely happen. That old shame about failing wells up and makes me small and jittery, and the silence just lets the anger and panic settle in my chest. I can't hold this on my own right now; can we slow down and stay with it a bit longer while you guide me?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to disentangle from the narrative and is becoming increasingly overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a process of "acting as if" to help the patient build confidence and take small steps towards valued action.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the silence is allowing the story to run its course, and it's really tough to hold onto. Let's try something different. I want you to imagine that you are already taking care of the situation, already making steps to prevent the eviction, and already feeling a sense of control and competence. Can you imagine what that feels like, and what you would see, hear, and experience if you were already in control?

Patient: I try to picture it — neat list, calm call with the bank, a little breathing room — but the minute I do my brain screams that's just the lull before the next huge bill and then the creditors tighten, utilities get cut, and eviction's inevitable. Even imagining feeling competent just lights this shame up inside me, like I'm replaying that failure, and the calm image feels fake and doomed to collapse. I'm jittery and distracted trying to hold the scene, and I can't really buy it — can we slow down and sit with how impossible that feels for me?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is struggling to maintain the "acting as if" scenario and is becoming increasingly frustrated with the impossibility of the image. Goal: Explore the value of acknowledging the impossibility and the shame that comes with it, rather than trying to force the scenario.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that trying to imagine a different scenario is really hard for you, and that's okay. It's like you're trying to hold onto a dream that's just out of reach. Let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way, and that it's okay to feel like the situation is impossible. Can you acknowledge the shame and frustration that comes up for you when you try to imagine a different scenario? Can you say to yourself: "I'm feeling really frustrated and ashamed that I'm not already in control, and that this situation is too difficult to handle"?

Patient: "I'm feeling really frustrated and ashamed that I'm not already in control, and that this situation is too difficult to handle." Saying it out loud just makes the shame flare and my chest clamp down, and my head immediately goes to the creditor→utilities→eviction loop like it's already happening. I can't really buy that it's okay yet — can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The patient is still struggling to accept the shame and frustration, and is becoming increasingly overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a process of acknowledging and accepting the emotions, rather than trying to change or avoid them.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that trying to acknowledge the emotions didn't quite work for you. Let's try something different. Can you simply acknowledge the emotions without judgment, without trying to change or avoid them? Can you say to yourself: "I am feeling frustrated and ashamed, and that's okay. These emotions are here, and I'm going to allow them to be here, without trying to change them or push them away"?

Patient: "I am feeling frustrated and ashamed, and that's okay." I can say the words, but the minute I do that old shame burns hotter — it feels like admitting I'm already failing, and my mind hijacks me with the creditor→utilities→eviction script like it's inevitable. I'm worn out and can't hold this steady right now; can we slow down and sit with it a bit longer?


--- Turn 25 ---

The patient is struggling to accept the emotions and is becoming increasingly overwhelmed. Goal: Introduce a process of acceptance and compassion, rather than trying to avoid or change the emotions.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that saying the words didn't quite work for you. Let's try something different. Can you offer yourself some kindness and compassion, even though you're feeling frustrated and ashamed? Can you say to yourself: "This person is feeling really tough right now, and it's okay to feel that way"?

Patient: I try to say it—"This person is feeling really tough right now, and it's okay to feel that way"—but it comes out flat, like I'm patting myself on the head. Saying it just lights the shame up — the old failure sneaks in, my chest clamps, and my brain immediately races the creditor→utilities→eviction script again. I'm worn out and can't steady this; can we slow down and sit with it a bit longer?
