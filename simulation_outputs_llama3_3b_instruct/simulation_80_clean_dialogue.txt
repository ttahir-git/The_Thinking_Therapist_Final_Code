Patient: Honestly, I've been stuck in this heavy sadness and zero motivation—feeling isolated just keeps spiraling and it's already choking my relationship. I can't stop seeing the worst: my partner gets fed up and leaves, I start messing up at work because I'm distracted, get demoted or fired, lose my home, and end up completely alone. I know that sounds extreme, but to me that's the only realistic outcome.

Therapist: Can you describe the specific situations where you start to feel like this catastrophic scenario is unfolding, and what's happening right before that moment?

Patient: Usually it starts with something tiny—my partner takes longer to reply to a text, or they cancel dinner, or at work someone glosses over my idea in a meeting. Right before the spiral I notice that little pause or that clipped tone, and my head immediately fills with the whole chain: they’re done with me, they'll leave, I'll be a wreck at work, get fired, lose my place, and end up totally alone. I try to tell myself it might not be true, but honestly I can’t; those outcomes feel inevitable, and then I just freeze or overcompensate and make things worse.

Therapist: What would happen if you made a conscious effort to observe that little pause or clipped tone without immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario, and instead asked yourself, "What's the first, tiny step I could take to address this, even if it's just a small gesture of communication with my partner or a brief question to clarify the meeting discussion?"

Patient: I try to picture that, but my brain instantly turns the tiny step into proof the worst will happen — like I ask a simple "Are you ok?" and they snap, think I'm needy, then pull away, which confirms I'm doomed and I fall apart at work and keep losing ground. Even the idea of clarifying something in a meeting feels like setting myself up to be exposed as useless, so I either clam up or try too hard and make it worse. I know it sounds over-the-top, but alternative, calmer outcomes just feel unreal to me.

Therapist: Can you explore what would be required for you to feel willing to take that initial, tiny step, even if it feels unworkable right now? What values or aspects of yourself would need to feel supported or validated in order for you to consider taking that small action, rather than letting fear or catastrophizing take over?

Patient: I think I'd need to feel like my dignity and competence are safe — that I'm allowed to be imperfect without being punished — plus a real sense of belonging so I don't feel disposable. Practically, that looks like repeated, clear reassurance from my partner, a manager who spots my effort instead of pouncing on mistakes, maybe a financial cushion and a therapist or coach sitting with me through the first tiny tries. But even saying that out loud makes me cynical — it feels like asking for guarantees that will never come, so my head goes straight back to the worst-case and I freeze.

Therapist: What would it be like if, for just one moment, you could acknowledge and accept the truth of your current situation, without immediately jumping to the worst-case scenario? Would you be able to pause and breathe, and for a brief moment, simply be with the reality of your circumstances, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: I try, but the moment I pause my brain blasts the worst-case scenario like a siren and I can't stay with just the facts. I can force one slow breath and for a split second it loosens, but then the catastrophe rolls back in and I feel guilty for even pretending it's okay. I don't trust that calm — it feels like ignoring a ticking time bomb that's definitely going to blow.

Therapist: Would you be willing to try a small, experimental step towards cultivating a sense of calm in the midst of catastrophic thinking, rather than letting it overwhelm you?

Patient: I guess I could try, but I'm really skeptical — the second I do anything my head already scripts the worst outcome and it feels like I'm setting myself up to fail. Maybe I can attempt one slow breath or send a very short, neutral text, but I keep imagining them getting annoyed and that confirming everything. I'm feeling overwhelmed just thinking about this; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what it is about feeling like you're setting yourself up to fail that feels so unbearable to you? Is there something that matters to you in this situation that would make it worth taking the risk, even if it's just a tiny one?

Patient: Because for me it's not just embarrassment — it feels like a corner post that, once knocked, proves I'm fundamentally flawed. If I screw up even a little, my partner will see I'm not worth sticking around for, my competence at work will be exposed, and that will start a chain that ends with me alone and scrambling to survive. What actually matters is not being abandoned, keeping my sense of competence, and feeling like I belong and matter to someone, but I keep wanting guarantees I know I won't get, so taking a tiny risk feels unbearable. I'm trying to say it out loud and I'm getting tense just now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you take a moment to imagine, for just one breath, what it would be like if you didn't need guarantees or assurances to feel like you matter to your partner? What would you value about being with them, and how could you honor that, even if it's just for a small step, like sending that neutral text or taking a slow breath?

Patient: For one breath I can picture it—feeling seen for who I am, us laughing at something stupid, the quiet comfort of knowing I don't have to prove myself every minute. What I'd value is that steady companionship, acceptance of my messiness, and the sense of being on the same team. I could honor that by sending one tiny, neutral text or taking a slow breath before answering, but my brain immediately says that'll just prove I'm needy and they'll walk away, so even imagining it makes me tense—can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you describe, in more detail, what it feels like to be on the same team, to feel that steady companionship and acceptance of your messiness? What would you need to feel seen and valued by your partner in that moment, and how could you express that, even if it's just a tiny, simple thing?

Patient: Being on the same team would feel like they notice my little efforts, let me be flawed without lecturing, and actually say, “I’ve got you” — like a quick joke, a touch, or a line that reminds me I’m not disposable. I’d need them to acknowledge the effort, name something I did right, and not immediately try to fix me or lecture, so I don’t feel judged or like I have to prove myself. A tiny thing I could do is send a short message — “Hey, feeling off today, can we cuddle later?” — or, in a meeting, ask one clarifying question instead of staying silent. But honestly, the second I picture sending that text I see them rolling their eyes, thinking I’m needy, pulling away, and that single moment triggering the whole disaster chain, so I’m already tensing up — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you take a moment to notice, without judgment, what's happening in your body when you start to tense up at the thought of sending that text or asking a clarifying question? What's the sensation in your body, and what's driving that tension?

Patient: My chest tightens and my throat feels like it's closing up—like I can't get words out—while my stomach drops and I get this cold sweat in my hands. My breath gets shallow and fast, my shoulders hunch, and my head immediately kicks into that worst-case movie where they roll their eyes, leave, and everything falls apart, which just makes the tension worse. It's like my body is wired to react to the prediction, primed to either freeze or overcompensate, because I feel sure any move will prove I'm disposable. I'm already getting flooded just saying this—can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you bring your attention to your body, without judgment, and gently ask yourself, "What's the sensation of this tension, right now, in this moment, without any judgment or expectation?"

Patient: When I try to notice it without judging, I just feel my chest crushing down and my throat closing, like words are stuck. My breath’s shallow and fast, my stomach drops, my hands go clammy, and my head instantly starts replaying the disaster movie — which only makes my shoulders lock up more. I can tell logically to just breathe, but my body’s already sprung into fight-or-freeze and I can’t stay with the moment. I’m getting overwhelmed saying this — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you simply notice, without trying to change or control, the sensation of your breath as it is, right now, without any words or thoughts? Just observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or expectation.

Patient: I try to follow the breath but it's shallow and tight—each inhale feels pinched, my heart's racing and my focus keeps snapping to the worst-case. The second I try to just be with it, my brain fires up the movie—They roll their eyes, they leave, I screw up at work, and everything collapses—so my breathing clamps down even more. I'm getting flooded doing this; can we slow down?

Therapist: I'd like to suggest a small, non-invasive exercise to help you create some space from the worst-case scenario. Can you allow me to guide you through a brief, slow and deep breath, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without any thoughts or expectations?

Patient: Okay—I'll try, but I'm really jittery; my chest's tight and my head's already playing the worst-case tape that they'll roll their eyes and everything collapses. Please go very slowly and just tell me when to inhale and exhale, one step at a time, because I might panic—can we slow down?

Therapist: Take a deep breath in, slowly, counting to four... inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... Hold the breath for a moment... 1... 2... 3... 4... And then exhale slowly, counting to four... exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... As you exhale, allow your chest to relax slightly... notice how your body feels...

Patient: Okay—I followed it: slow inhale, held, and for a half-second my chest eased and I thought maybe…then as I exhaled the worst-case screen slammed back on. My throat closed, hands went clammy, breath went shallow again, and I could literally feel the movie of them rolling their eyes and walking away replaying. I got a tiny bit of relief but I'm already getting flooded—can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you hold the breath for a moment, and then, as you exhale, I'd like you to notice what happened right after your chest eased, before the worst-case scenario came back in. What was it that happened, exactly? Was it a sense of calm, or something else?

Patient: For a split second there was this soft loosening—my chest lightened and I actually felt like I could breathe without panicking, like maybe I could send the text or ask the question calmly. Then the disaster movie slammed back in: I pictured them rolling their eyes, walking away, me freezing up at work, getting demoted or fired, and everything collapsing. Now my hands are clammy, my heart's racing, and I'm really flooded and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Notice the contrast between the soft loosening in your chest and the return of the catastrophic thinking. What do you think is happening in that brief moment of relaxation? Is it like a door opening, allowing a sense of calm to seep in? Can you explore what might be making it harder to stay with that sense of calm, and what might happen if you could, for just a moment, stay with it?

Patient: It feels exactly like a door cracking open for a second—my chest loosens and I can actually picture asking the question or sending the text without collapsing. Then my brain's fortune-teller yells the worst—'they'll roll their eyes, leave, you'll humiliate yourself at work'—and everything slams shut and my body floods with anxiety. I can see that staying with the calm might let me act differently, but I don't trust it at all right now; I'm really anxious and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you take a moment to reflect on why you're having trouble trusting this moment of calm? What's the story that's making it hard for you to believe that you can stay with it, even for just a moment? Is it a past experience, a past judgment, or something else?

Patient: Because every time I let my guard down in the past it got used against me — a parent who left when I showed weakness, bosses who humiliated mistakes, and an ex who bailed the minute things got messy. My brain learned that calm is a trap: the moment I feel safe the doom-script starts and I get flooded, which then “proves” I was right. I can't trust the loosening because it always feels like the prelude to them rolling their eyes and walking away. I'm really anxious and distracted right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you consider this: what if the stories about your past experiences aren't entirely true? What if the people who left or humiliated you didn't do so because of your calmness, but for other reasons? Would it be possible for you to re-evaluate these stories, and perhaps even imagine an alternative narrative that includes yourself as someone who is capable of being vulnerable and still being worthy of love and acceptance?

Patient: Part of me wants to believe maybe those stories aren't the whole truth—that people left for their own reasons and I could be vulnerable and still be worth sticking around for. But my brain immediately turns that into bait: if I open up they'll roll their eyes, walk out, I’ll tank at work, lose everything, and that kinder story feels impossible, so I can't trust it. I'm already flooded—chest tight, throat closing, hands sweaty—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a break from the conversation for a moment. Can you take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly on both feet, the sensation of the air on your skin, the sounds around you...

Patient: I did it — I breathed and felt my feet, the weight shifting a little, the air on my face and the distant hum of traffic for a second. It felt weirdly grounding for like half a beat, then my brain blasted the worst — them rolling their eyes, walking out, me freezing at work and everything collapsing — and my chest slammed shut, hands sweaty. I'm really jittery and distracted now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Can you go back to the moment when your feet felt grounded, and notice what happened before your brain blasted the worst-case scenario. What was it that changed, exactly? Was it something you noticed in your body, a sensation, a thought, or a feeling?

Patient: It was literally a tiny thing — a soft, almost invisible flutter in my chest and a split-second thought: “what if they’re pulling away?” — and my throat closed up, breath got shallow, and my shoulders locked. That tiny thought instantly flips a switch and the whole worst-case movie floods in — they’re annoyed, they roll their eyes, they leave, I mess up at work, I lose everything — and the grounded feeling snaps shut. I don’t know how to trust that small calm because my brain treats it like a trap, and now I’m really jittery and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the physical sensations that happened when you noticed the thought "what if they're pulling away". What was your body doing in that moment? Was your heart rate faster, your hands sweaty, your stomach tight? Can you notice the exact sensation of your body tensing up, and what's happening in that moment, without trying to change it or judge it?

Patient: My heart just rockets — like it's banging in my chest — my breath goes shallow and quick, my throat tightens so words feel stuck, and my stomach drops into a cold knot. My hands go clammy, my shoulders hunch, and my head immediately floods with the worst-case loop — them pulling away, rolling their eyes, me freezing at work, everything collapsing — which makes the body tighten even more. I can sort of notice those sensations, but the flood makes it impossible to stay with them calmly. I'm really jittery and distracted right now; can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause for a moment, and I'd like you to bring your attention to your breath, without trying to control it or change it in any way. Can you simply observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without judgment or expectation?

Patient: I'm trying to notice it, but my breaths are shallow and thin—like they barely get in before my chest tightens again. Every pause turns into that awful loop in my head and my heart speeds up, so instead of just observing I get flooded with the worst-case images and can't stay with the breath. I'm really jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on your breath, I'd like you to focus on the sensation of your physical body, without trying to change it or observe it as a thought. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the feeling of the air on your skin, the sensation of your body touching the chair or bed?

Patient: Okay—I’m trying. My feet feel planted but kind of numb at the soles, like there’s pressure under them and my weight’s heavy on the chair; the air on my face is cool and my shirt rubs against my skin. But even that grounding feels fragile—like if I move the wrong way the floor’ll drop out and the whole disaster-prediction kicks in: they’ll pull away, I’ll freeze at work, lose everything. My hands are sweaty, my heart’s racing, and I can’t hold the calm for more than a breath before the worst-case movie takes over. I’m really flooded and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a very small step back from the worst-case thinking. Can you simply acknowledge the presence of that catastrophic script, without judgment or engagement? Notice it as a thought, a story, a pattern of thinking, without taking it as a prediction or a fact. Can you simply observe it, like a movie playing in the background, without letting it drive your body's response?

Patient: Okay—I can notice it: there's that movie in my head saying, “they're annoyed, they'll roll their eyes and leave, you'll mess up at work, get fired, lose everything.” I try to watch it like a film in the background, but the instant I label it a thought my chest tightens, my throat clamps, my hands sweat, and I get yanked right back into believing it's real. I'm already flooded and really jittery—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of trying to watch the thought as a movie, can you simply label it as a thought, without judgment or engagement? Can you say to yourself, "That's a thought," or "That's a story," without adding any other words or emotions to it? No judgment, no evaluation, just a simple label. Can you try that with me?

Patient: Okay—"that's a thought," "that's a story." Right after I say it my chest tightens, my throat clamps, my hands go sweaty, and it still feels like proof the movie's real, not just a thought. I'm really jittery and distracted—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a closer look at the physical sensations that are happening right now. Can you notice the sensation of your chest tightening, the clamping of your throat, the sweating of your hands? What do you think is happening in your body when you say to yourself, "that's a thought"? Is it like a reflex, a automatic response, or something else?

Patient: It feels completely automatic — like a reflex my body learned long ago. The second I say “that’s a thought” my chest clamps, my throat tightens, my heart spikes, my hands sweat, and the worst-case movie floods back in like it’s proof, not just a thought. Saying the label feels hollow, like I'm trying to bargain with a reflex that’s already decided everything will collapse. I’m really jittery and distracted right now — can we slow down?
