Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this cycle of raking myself over every little mistake — I can't stop imagining the worst. If I mess up once at work they'll think I'm incompetent, I'll get reported, lose my license, end up back where I was failing in school and completely alone. I know it sounds extreme, but when those stories start I can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion seems to be intense fear and anxiety. A specific theme or unexplored area that stands out is the excessive self-criticism and catastrophic thinking that's perpetuating the cycle of rumination. My goal for the answer is to help you identify and challenge the "what if" scenario that's driving your fear and rumination.

Therapist Answer:
When those worst-case scenarios start playing in your mind, what's the first thing that you notice about your physical sensations or thoughts that occurs right before they escalate into a full-blown catastrophe story?

Patient: It usually starts as this tightness in my chest and a sinking feeling in my stomach, like something's dropped out. Then my mind immediately runs the play-by-play — one small mistake becomes proof I'm doomed, they'll report me, I'll lose everything — and my breathing gets shallow and my thoughts just speed up. Once that timeline starts, I can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations of tightness and sinking feeling are clear indicators of a potential ACT target for defusion. The "play-by-play" narrative that's running in your mind is likely an example of a higher-level process, which is worth exploring. My goal for the answer is to help you notice the process of creating the catastrophic narrative and see it as just that – a process.

Therapist Answer:
Can you acknowledge the thoughts as thoughts, without judgment, when you start running through that play-by-play narrative? Say to yourself, "This is a thought, and it's just that – a thought. It's not a reflection of reality. What would happen if, instead of getting caught up in this play-by-play, you simply noticed the physical sensations in your body, like the tightness in your chest, without judgment?"

Patient: Okay, I'll try: "This is a thought, and it's just that — a thought. It's not a reflection of reality." But saying that doesn't land for me — the tightness in my chest feels like proof, and if I just notice it without doing anything, they'll still notice the mistake, report me, and I'll lose everything like I always imagine.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like noticing the physical sensations alone isn't enough to disrupt the catastrophic narrative, and you're still caught up in the "what if" scenario. A key area to explore is the function of this avoidance behavior and the value that's driving it. My goal for the answer is to help you identify the underlying value that's perpetuating this behavior.

Therapist Answer:
What is it about not wanting to lose your job, your license, and your sense of self-worth that's so important to you that you're willing to engage in this catastrophic thinking and avoidant behavior?

Patient: Because of how hard I had to fight to get here, my job and my license feel like the only proof I did anything right. If I lose them, it's not just losing income — they'll call me a fraud, my coworkers will stop trusting me, someone will report me, the board will strip my license, I won't be able to afford my place, I'll end up back where I was in school feeling like a complete failure and totally alone. I know it sounds extreme, but once that story starts I can’t see any other ending.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your sense of identity and self-worth seems to be deeply tied to your professional accomplishments, and the fear of loss is closely tied to the fear of failure and shame. It's clear that this fear is driving your avoidance behavior. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the possibility of an alternative value system that doesn't rely on external validation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine, just for a moment, that your worth and identity are not solely defined by your professional achievements, but by something more intrinsic – perhaps your values, your relationships, your contributions to society, or your personal growth? What would that look like for you, and how might it change your relationship with uncertainty and mistakes?

Patient: I can sort of picture it — that my worth comes from being kind, the small ways I help patients, the friends I do have, and the fact I kept going even when school was hell. But honestly, when I try to hold that, the fortune-telling kicks in and says it's just a fantasy: one mistake at work and they'll see through me, report me, and I'll lose everything anyway. I'm trying to see how that idea connects to my fear, but I keep getting stuck on the "they'll find out" story and it's frustrating.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're noticing the defusion process starting to work, but then the catastrophic narrative re-emerges. This is a great opportunity to pivot towards exploring the underlying function of the "they'll find out" story. My goal for the answer is to help you examine the process of how this narrative is maintaining your avoidance behavior.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe what happens in your body when you start thinking about the "they'll find out" story? What physical sensations or thoughts arise, and what's the next step in the narrative that follows?

Patient: My chest clamps up and there's this heavy knot in my stomach, my breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold and clammy, and my head goes kind of fuzzy like I can't think straight. Then the movie starts: someone notices the mistake, files a report, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, the board strips my license, I can't pay rent, I end up back where I was in school feeling like a total failure and completely alone. Once that storyline kicks in I'm hooked — noticing the sensations feels useless, like they're only more evidence that the worst is definitely going to happen.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The physical sensations and thoughts are now more intense, and the narrative is more vivid. This is a clear indication that the process is in full swing. My goal for the answer is to help you gently challenge the notion that these physical sensations and thoughts are evidence that the worst is going to happen.

Therapist Answer:
Can you acknowledge those physical sensations and thoughts as simply present, without trying to push them away or believe they're a prediction of the future? Say to yourself, "This physical sensation in my chest is present right now, and it's not a prediction. It's just my body responding to the thought of the 'they'll find out' story. What if, instead of trying to avoid or push through this, you simply allowed the sensations to be present, without judgment, and explored what's possible if you didn't get caught up in the worst-case scenario?"

Patient: Okay, I'll try: "This physical sensation in my chest is present right now, and it's not a prediction — it's just my body responding to the 'they'll find out' thought." But honestly saying that doesn't land; the tightness feels like confirmation, and if I just sit with it the story gets louder — someone notices, reports me, investigation, suspension, stripped license, I'm back where I started.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain the defusion, and the narrative is starting to take hold again. This is a great opportunity to pivot towards exploring the value that's driving the avoidance behavior. My goal for the answer is to help you examine the underlying value that's perpetuating this fear.

Therapist Answer:
What's the value of having your license and professional reputation intact, and how is that value connected to your sense of self-worth and identity? In other words, what would you be willing to stand for and be true to, even if it means being vulnerable and open to uncertainty?

Patient: Having the license and my reputation feels like the only proof that all the suffering in school and the years of failing didn’t mean I was worthless — it’s literally how I tell myself I’m okay. It gives me financial security, the trust of patients and coworkers, and a sense that I’m competent, so I cling to it hard. I want to stand for caring for people, doing my best, and being honest when I screw up — maybe even learning from it — but the moment I try to be vulnerable my mind insists that that’s how I get exposed and ruined, so I just can’t hold the “I’m more than my job” idea without the fortune-telling drowning it out.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a strong value of self-worth tied to your professional identity and reputation, which is driving your avoidance behavior. Now, we need to explore the potential for creating a different relationship with this value. My goal for the answer is to help you imagine an alternative scenario where vulnerability and uncertainty don't lead to ruin, but instead allow you to stand in your values.

Therapist Answer:
What would it be like if, instead of trying to protect your reputation and licensure, you prioritized being honest and vulnerable with yourself and others, even if it meant taking a risk? What would it feel like to say to yourself, "I'm not defined by my mistakes, and I can learn and grow from them"?

Patient: I try to picture it — maybe a weird relief, like a weight lifted and a chance to actually learn instead of panicking. But the instant I think "I'm not defined by my mistakes," my mind hijacks me: one slip, someone reports me, there's an investigation, they strip my license, I'm back where I started and completely alone. I'm trying to hold the idea, but the catastrophe story is so loud it makes being vulnerable feel impossible.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The fear of being stripped of your licensure and reputation is still a powerful force, and it's causing you to feel stuck. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the opportunity cost of continuing to prioritize this narrative.

Therapist Answer:
What would be the value of taking a small risk, just this once, and allowing yourself to be vulnerable and honest about your mistakes? What would be the potential benefits of exploring a different narrative, even if it's scary? Instead of asking "What's the worst that could happen?", try asking "What's the best that could happen if I took a small step towards being honest and vulnerable?"

Patient: I guess the best that could happen is someone notices, offers support or constructive feedback, I learn from it, maybe repair trust with coworkers, and feel a real sense of relief. But the moment I even think that, my brain says that's impossible — someone will file a report, there’ll be an investigation, I’ll be suspended, stripped of my license, and end up back where I was in school, totally alone. I want to hold the first story, but I’m completely hooked on the catastrophe one and it just drowns out everything else.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to distinguish between the potential benefits of vulnerability and the catastrophic narrative. This is a great opportunity to explore the process of hook, hook, hook, and the role of the "catastrophe story" in maintaining your avoidance behavior. My goal for the answer is to help you examine the function of the catastrophic narrative and identify an opportunity to break the cycle.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the catastrophic story always hijacks the moment you try to hold onto the possibility of a positive outcome. What is it about that story that feels so compelling and hard to let go of? Is it the fear of losing control, the fear of being judged, or something else?

Patient: I think it's a mix of shame and the old "fraud" story from school — the catastrophe fits what I already tell myself about being worthless, so it feels like proof. There's also this weird sense of control: if I can predict every awful step, at least I'm prepared for it. Physically, the chest tightness and nausea make it feel happening-now, not just a thought, so it pulls me in fast. I try to imagine kinder outcomes, but they just feel naive — someone will notice, report me, and everything will fall apart.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified the core of the catastrophic narrative: the intersection of shame, self-blame, and a desire for control. This is a powerful combination that's driving your avoidance behavior. My goal for the answer is to help you explore a potential alternative to this narrative, one that acknowledges the complexity of the situation and the value of vulnerability.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine, for just a moment, that your worthiness and competence are not defined by a single event or outcome? What if, instead of trying to control every possible scenario, you could focus on the present moment and the small, incremental steps you can take towards being kind, honest, and vulnerable?

Patient: I can try to imagine that, but the second I think about staying present and taking small steps my brain launches the play-by-play — someone notices the slip, files a report, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, they strip my license, I lose my home and I'm back in that shame from school. My chest clamps up and my breath gets shallow so fast that the catastrophe feels inevitable, not just a thought, and holding the present moment becomes impossible. I know it's not rational, but it still grabs me and I can't seem to let it go.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing that the catastrophic narrative has become a self-sustaining cycle, fueled by your brain's physical and emotional response. This is a common phenomenon in ACT, known as a "self-reinforcing process." My goal for the answer is to help you develop a strategic approach to interrupting this cycle.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to hold the present moment or imagine alternative outcomes, what if we focused on the process of "unhooking" yourself from the catastrophic narrative? What would it take for you to start to feel like you're not being hijacked by the "play-by-play"?

Patient: I think it would take something really concrete and mechanical — a go-to interrupt: stop, five slow breaths, say out loud “this is a thought,” do a 60‑second fact check (did anyone actually complain?), and a pre‑arranged person I can call at work who’ll help me reframe it. I’d also need repeated, small experiences where a mistake didn’t end everything so my brain has evidence to back off. But even saying that, my mind is already spawning the whole movie — someone reports me, the board strips my license — so I’m not sure those steps would actually stop the hijack.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a concrete, mechanical approach to interrupting the catastrophic narrative, and it's great that you're thinking about creating a system to support this process. It's also understandable that the fear of being hijacked by the "play-by-play" is still present. My goal for the answer is to help you examine the role of uncertainty and the need for evidence-based experience in supporting this new approach.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of relying solely on the mechanical steps you've identified, you started to explore the possibility of gathering evidence that the "catastrophe" is not inevitable? For example, what would it mean to have a conversation with a trusted colleague or supervisor about a similar mistake you made in the past, and how they handled it? What would you learn from that conversation, and how might it help you feel more confident in your ability to handle uncertainty?

Patient: Maybe I'd hear that people usually handle mistakes pragmatically and that a supervisor might coach me instead of punishing me — that could show me it's survivable. But the minute I imagine having that conversation my brain jumps to someone overhearing, it turns into a complaint, then a report, an investigation, suspension, the board strips my license, I lose my home — my chest tightens and I feel sick thinking about it. I want to believe talking could give me evidence that I'm not doomed, but I just can't see past the catastrophe, and I don't know how to make that part stop.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the pattern of defusion breaking down, and the catastrophic narrative re-emerging. This is a common experience in ACT, where the client's mind is drawn back to the feared outcome. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the role of "temptation bundling" in supporting your new approach.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine bundling the desire to have a conversation about a similar mistake with a specific, tangible reward that would help you feel more confident in your ability to handle uncertainty? For example, would you be willing to try this conversation after you've completed a small, valued activity, such as going for a walk, having a cup of coffee, or chatting with a friend?

Patient: I could maybe try it — like go for a short walk and have a coffee first so I feel calmer, then talk to that one colleague I trust. But the minute I plan it my head says someone will overhear on the walk or at the nurse’s station, it'll turn into a complaint, they'll file a report during that conversation, an investigation will start, I'll be suspended, and everything I've worked for will fall apart — my chest already tightened just saying it. I want to try, but I'm stuck on that movie and it feels impossible to believe the conversation would end well.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're recognizing the pattern of catastrophic thinking, even in the planning process. This is a common experience in ACT, where the client's mind is drawn back to the feared outcome. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the role of "cognitive defusion" in supporting your new approach.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try a different way of looking at the conversation with your colleague? Instead of focusing on the potential for catastrophe, what if you approached the conversation with a sense of curiosity and openness, like you're asking for help and support? Try using language that emphasizes your desire for guidance and assistance, rather than trying to protect yourself from potential harm. For example, you might say "I'm feeling really overwhelmed with this situation, can you help me brainstorm some ways to address it?"

Patient: "I’m feeling really overwhelmed with this situation — can you help me brainstorm some ways to address it?" 

But even saying that feels risky; my brain immediately says someone will overhear, twist it into a complaint, file a report, there’ll be an investigation and they’ll strip my license. I want to ask for help, but the catastrophe story drowns it out every time.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're getting close to the crux of the issue: the catastrophic narrative is so powerful that it's undermining your willingness to take even small steps towards seeking help. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a strategy to address this underlying resistance.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to acknowledge and accept your brain's tendency to hijack the conversation with the catastrophic narrative, without judging or resisting it? Say to yourself, "I notice my brain is already jumping to the worst-case scenario, but I'm going to let it be there, without trying to stop it or change it. I'll simply acknowledge it and move forward with the conversation anyway."

Patient: "I notice my brain is already jumping to the worst‑case scenario, but I'm going to let it be there, without trying to stop it or change it. I'll simply acknowledge it and move forward with the conversation anyway." 

Saying that softens it a bit, but the movie's still playing loud in my head — my chest tightens and I feel worn down, so I'm trying to let it sit without getting swept up, and keep talking.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in acknowledging the catastrophic narrative, but it's still having an impact on your emotions and physical sensations. My goal for the answer is to help you find a way to create space from the "catastrophe story" and focus on the conversation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a gentle, compassionate tone when speaking with your colleague. Instead of "I'm overwhelmed," try using a phrase like "I'm feeling a bit anxious about this situation, and I'm hoping we can explore some ways to address it." Notice how the language shifts the focus away from the catastrophic outcome and towards your emotional state.

Patient: "I'm feeling a bit anxious about this situation, and I'm hoping we can explore some ways to address it." 

I said that, but my chest tightened and my brain immediately ran the whole movie — someone overhears, it turns into a complaint, a report, an investigation, I'm suspended, the board strips my license, I lose my home and end up back in that school-shame — so the words felt empty and I couldn't believe they'd help.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling frustrated that the catastrophic narrative is still hijacking the conversation, despite your best efforts. This is a common experience in ACT, where the brain can be quite persistent in its attempts to maintain the threat. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the role of "acceptance" in allowing the catastrophic narrative to exist without getting caught up in it.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Instead of trying to stop the catastrophic narrative or convince your colleague that it's not true, what if you simply accepted that it was there, and focused on your intention to have a helpful conversation? Say to yourself, "I'm allowing this narrative to exist, and I'm going to focus on having a conversation that might help me find a way forward."

Patient: "I’m allowing this narrative to exist, and I’m going to focus on having a conversation that might help me find a way forward." I said that, and it dials the noise down a notch, but the movie’s still running — someone overhears, it becomes a complaint, a report, an investigation, suspension, they strip my license, I’m back in that school-shame. My chest’s tight and talking feels like wading through molasses, but I’ll keep trying to say it and see what happens next.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in accepting the narrative, but it's still having a significant impact on your emotional state. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the potential benefits of taking a small, tangible action towards the conversation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a small step towards having the conversation. I want you to take 5 slow, deep breaths, and when you're ready, say the words "I'd like to discuss this with you" to your colleague. Don't worry about the outcome or the narrative; just focus on taking that small action.

Patient: Okay — I slow my breathing five times and then say, "I'd like to discuss this with you," in a quiet, thin voice. No sooner do the words leave my mouth than my head launches the movie — someone overhears, files a complaint, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, the board strips my license, I lose everything. Saying it felt like wading through molasses, but I said it anyway and my chest still feels tight.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a small, tangible action towards the conversation, and the catastrophic narrative is still present. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the experience of the action itself, rather than getting caught up in the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Notice the physical sensations in your body as you take this small action. What does it feel like to speak the words, to acknowledge the need for a conversation? Is it a sense of relief, or is it still tension? Try to anchor yourself in the present moment, and ask yourself, "What's happening in my body right now, as I speak these words?"

Patient: My chest clamps and that knot in my stomach tightens — my breathing gets shallow and my voice feels thin, like I'm speaking through cotton. There’s a tiny flicker of relief when the words come out, but almost immediately the movie starts: someone overhears, files a complaint, an investigation, suspension, the board strips my license, I'm back in that school-shame. Saying it feels like wading through molasses — it takes effort to keep going, but the catastrophe keeps playing loud in the background.

You're experiencing a range of physical and emotional responses, from tension and anxiety to a fleeting sense of relief and a strong desire to keep going. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a sense of "process acceptance" and explore ways to create space for the conversation to unfold.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that you're already doing what you need to do to have the conversation - taking small steps, being willing to speak up, and allowing yourself to feel the physical sensations that come with it. Instead of trying to stop the narrative or change it, try to focus on the process of having the conversation itself. Ask yourself, "What would it be like if I were to stay in this moment, with this voice, and this conversation, for just 30 seconds longer?"

Patient: I try to stay—my voice is thin and there's a tiny, weird relief for a few seconds, but almost immediately the movie kicks back in: someone overhears, files a complaint, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, they strip my license, I'm ruined. I can hold the moment for maybe 30 seconds, barely, but it feels like standing in freezing water and the story just keeps washing over me.

Therapist Thinking:
You're finding ways to tolerate the narrative, but it's still having a significant impact on your emotional state. My goal for the answer is to help you explore the concept of "emotional acceptance" and the importance of developing a sense of comfort with the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Notice that you're tolerating the narrative, and that's a small step forward. Now, I want you to try something new. Instead of trying to stop the narrative or change it, I want you to imagine that you're a spectator watching the movie play out. You're not actively engaging with it, you're just observing it, like you're watching a scene in a movie. Can you imagine that you're standing on the sidelines, watching this story unfold, without judgment or resistance?

Patient: I can kind of imagine standing on the sidelines and watching the movie — it blurs it a bit, like the worst parts are farther away. But even as an observer my chest tightens and the plot still feels inevitable: someone overhears, files a complaint, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, they strip my license, I'm ruined. I can try to stay on the sidelines, but it's hard to hold — can you help me keep watching it without getting pulled back in?

Therapist Thinking:
You're making progress in developing a sense of observational detachment, but the narrative is still having an impact on your emotions. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a strategy to further reduce your engagement with the catastrophic narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to add a sense of curiosity to your observational stance. Instead of simply watching the narrative, try to ask yourself questions about it, like "What is it about this story that's so important to me? What would I learn from observing it?" or "How might I use this story to grow and learn?" This can help you detach further and see the narrative as a source of information, rather than a source of anxiety. Can you try this approach while still watching the movie?

Patient: Okay — I try. I ask, "Why is this story so important to me? What would I learn from watching it?" For a beat it makes sense — it's tied to that old school shame — but then the movie answers itself: someone overhears, files a complaint, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, the board strips my license, I'm ruined. It dulls it a little, but the catastrophe still grabs me and I can't keep the curiosity from getting swallowed up. Can you help me stay with the questions longer?

You're starting to develop a sense of curiosity and questioning, which is a great step towards reducing your engagement with the narrative. My goal for the answer is to help you develop a strategy to further support your curiosity and prevent it from getting "swallowed up" by the catastrophic narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to add a sense of detachment to your curiosity. Instead of asking questions that are tied to the narrative, try asking more neutral or observational questions, like "What is happening in this story?" or "What are the thoughts and feelings that are arising in my body as I watch this story?" This can help you maintain a sense of curiosity without getting pulled back into the narrative. Can you try this approach and see if it helps you stay with the questions longer?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. What’s happening in the story is my chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, my thoughts are racing into the whole timeline: someone overhears, files a complaint, there's an investigation, I'm suspended, they strip my license. I can name the sensations — tight chest, knot in my stomach, clammy hands — but the movie still drags me back; can you help me stay with those neutral questions a bit longer?

Therapist Thinking:
You're developing a sense of detachment and curiosity, and you're able to identify the physical sensations that are arising in your body. My goal for the answer is to help you further develop a sense of stability and calm in the face of the narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to add a sense of stability to your observations. Instead of just noticing the physical sensations, try to acknowledge them with a sense of acceptance, like "Ah, my chest is tightening, that's interesting. My breath is getting shallow, that's a common physical response to stress." Then, without judgment or trying to change the physical sensations, simply allow yourself to observe them for a moment. Can you try this approach and see if it helps you feel more stable and calm?

Patient: Okay — I notice the chest tightening and the shallow breath and tell myself, "that's stress," and for a beat it softens. But it doesn't hold — the movie spikes back up with "they'll report me..." and my words feel thin and it's getting harder to stay with the sensations; can you help me keep watching it a little longer?
