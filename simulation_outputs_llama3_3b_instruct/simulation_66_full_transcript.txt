--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm constantly worrying I'll mess up at a job even though I'm currently unemployed, and that worry makes me procrastinate until I panic. The health scare and PTSD have made it worse, so I get stuck overthinking every little thing and don't move. I've tried different techniques before, so how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion seems to be anxiety and hopelessness. I'd like to explore the theme of avoidance in your current situation. The unexplored area might be the underlying values that drive your behavior and the potential consequences of taking action despite your fears. My goal is to help you connect your values to a specific action that could help you move forward.

Therapist Answer:
What's one thing about your job or daily activities that feels truly important to you, and what would it be like if you were to take small, committed action towards that thing, even if it feels scary or uncertain?

Patient: Keeping some kind of routine and feeling useful — not the job title so much as not wasting my days — feels important to me. Maybe doing one small thing each day, like 20 minutes on my resume or emailing one contact, would slowly chip away at the paralysis, but I've tried tiny goals before and they just fizzle when the worry and panic hit. How is that supposed to help when the fear of screwing up kicks in and I freeze?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your fear of failure and feelings of paralysis seem to be linked to your core emotion of anxiety and hopelessness. I'd like to explore the unexplored area of your experience with tiny goals, and the potential for a different approach. My goal is to introduce a technique that might help you make room for action despite the fear of failure.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine having a conversation with your anxiety, as if you were having it with a friend, and saying "I'm willing to take this tiny step, not because I think I'll succeed, but because it feels important to me that I'm moving forward"?

Patient: Okay... I can imagine saying that to my anxiety: "I'm willing to take this tiny step, not because I think I'll succeed, but because it matters that I'm moving forward." Saying it feels a little steadier for a moment, but then the panic kicks in and I start thinking, "What if it's not enough?" I've tried talking myself into things before—how is that supposed to stop the freeze when the fear spikes?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like your mind is good at rationalizing and justifying, which might be perpetuating the freeze. I'd like to pivot to introducing a technique that can help you observe your thoughts and emotions more clearly, without getting caught up in them. My goal is to create space for a new way of relating to your anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
Can you observe the thought "What if it's not enough?" without judgment, as if you were watching a movie about your thoughts, and say to yourself, "That's a thought, and it's okay. What's the physical sensation in my body right now, as I look at that thought"?

Patient: Okay — when I tell myself "That's a thought, and it's okay," there's a tiny softening, but physically my chest tightens and my stomach knots, my hands feel cold, and my breathing gets shallow. I can watch it for a few seconds like a movie, but then the panic spikes and I just freeze. How is noticing this supposed to stop that freeze? I've named sensations before and it doesn't stick when the fear hits.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like your body's physical response to the thought is quite strong, and your ability to observe it without getting caught up in the thought is still quite fragile. I'd like to introduce a technique that can help you create a small gap between your thoughts and physical sensations, allowing you to respond more intentionally. My goal is to introduce a specific exercise that can help you develop this gap.

Therapist Answer:
Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself "I am not my physical sensations"? Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and try to allow the physical sensations to be present without identifying with them.

Patient: I try — I breathe in slowly, let it out and say quietly, "I am not my physical sensations." For a few seconds my breathing softens and my shoulders drop, but then the chest tightness and that knot in my stomach creep back and my hands go cold. It helps for a moment, yeah, but the panic comes right back — how is that supposed to help when it never lasts? I'm trying here, but it feels like I'm just delaying the freeze.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like the exercise is providing a brief reprieve, but not a lasting solution. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the freeze might not be about the exercise itself, but rather about the values and intentions behind it. My goal is to help you connect with what you value about taking action, despite the fear.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of one specific value that you'd like to act on, even if you don't feel 100% ready, and what would happen to you if you took small action towards that value, even if it meant getting stuck or experiencing some discomfort?

Patient: I guess the value is feeling useful and competent — not about the title, but not wasting my days. If I did one small thing each day, like 20 minutes on my resume or one follow-up email, maybe I'd get tiny wins that chip away at the shame and prove I can move forward even when I'm scared. But I've done tiny steps before and they just fizzle out when the panic hits — how is this supposed to help when the fear freezes me?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're trying to build momentum and prove your competence to yourself, which is a valuable motivation. However, the fear of failure and panic might be overwhelming you. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the tiny wins might not be the goal, but rather the act of showing up and taking small action itself, regardless of the outcome. My goal is to help you connect with the value of taking action, not just the end result.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try taking one small step, like writing a single sentence on your resume, without worrying about the outcome, and simply focus on the physical sensations in your body as you write it, without judgment?

Patient: Okay—I actually did it: I wrote one sentence on my resume — "Experienced administrative professional with strong attention to detail and a track record of reliable project support." While I typed, I noticed my fingers tense, my chest tighten and my breath get shallow, then a little loosen when I finished that line; it felt like a tiny relief but the knot in my stomach is already whispering it won't be enough. How is that supposed to help when the panic hits and everything freezes again?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a concrete action and noticed a small physical response, which is a good start. It's clear that the panic is still a powerful force, but the tiny relief you felt might be a sign that you're making progress in the right direction. My goal is to help you build on this small win and introduce a technique to help you connect with the value of taking action in the face of uncertainty.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine, before you start a new task, taking a moment to acknowledge and thank your body for being willing to take the first small step, like writing that sentence?

Patient: I tried it just now—saying, "Thanks, body, for getting me to do this." For a few breaths my shoulders eased and I felt a tiny bit of relief, but the knot in my stomach is still there and the thought "this won't be enough" pops back in. I get that it helps for a moment, but how is that supposed to stop the panic when it actually hits and I'm frozen?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're making progress in acknowledging and appreciating your body's willingness to take action, but the thought "this won't be enough" is still a strong trigger. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the panic might not be about the outcome, but about the narrative you're telling yourself about yourself and your abilities. My goal is to help you challenge and reformulate this narrative.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try reframing the thought "this won't be enough" to something more neutral, like "I'm not sure if this will be enough, but I'm taking a step", and then pause, without judgment, before continuing to the next step?

Patient: I tried saying, "I'm not sure if this will be enough, but I'm taking a step," and pausing — it did calm me a bit, my breath eased and the shoulders dropped for a few seconds. But almost immediately the knot in my stomach and that "not enough" voice come back and I get stuck again. How is that supposed to help when the panic spikes — what do I actually do in that pause so it doesn't just fizzle?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're getting closer to making progress, but the pause is still not providing a sustainable solution. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the pause itself is not the goal, but rather the quality of the pause. My goal is to help you learn to be with the pause, without doing anything, and see what happens.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try simply sitting with the pause, without trying to do anything, and without judgment, for a few seconds longer, until your body and mind start to relax and settle?

Patient: I did it — sat with the pause for maybe ten seconds, felt my breath slow a touch and my shoulders drop, then the knot in my stomach nudged back in and my mind started racing. It was a small calm, but it doesn't hold; I get impatient and want to do something to prove I'm moving. How is just sitting supposed to stop the panic when it always snaps back?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're making progress in learning to tolerate the pause, but you're still driven to do something to prove your progress. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the goal is not to eliminate the panic, but to learn to be with it, without acting on it. My goal is to help you develop a sense of self-compassion and understanding for what's happening in your body and mind.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to observe the sensation of the knot in your stomach, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling stuck and scared, and that's okay, because it's a normal response to uncertainty"?

Patient: I did — I said to myself, "I'm feeling stuck and scared, and that's okay," and for a few breaths the knot loosened a little and my breathing calmed. But it faded fast and the chest tightness and that "what's the point?" voice slid right back in. I'm trying, but it feels like a tiny bandage on a bigger break — how is this actually supposed to stop the freeze when it shows up?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're getting closer to developing a sense of self-compassion, but the underlying issue of the freeze remains. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea that the freeze might be related to the idea of a "point" or a "purpose" that's driving your motivation. My goal is to help you examine the value of taking action for its own sake, rather than for the sake of a specific outcome.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to consider what it would mean to take a small action, like sending that follow-up email, simply because it feels like the right thing to do, not because of any specific expectation or outcome, but because it feels connected to the value of being a competent and reliable person?

Patient: It would mean proving, even to myself, that I can be useful and not waste another day — a tiny bit of evidence that I'm moving toward being competent again. Maybe sending that one email would chip away at the shame and give me a little momentum, but I've done low-stakes stuff before and when the panic hits I freeze and let days slip. How is sending one email supposed to stop that freeze when my chest tightens and my hands go cold? I'm willing to try, but I need something concrete for the moment the panic spikes — what do I actually do right then?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're getting closer to understanding the value of taking action for its own sake, but you still need a concrete strategy for managing the panic that arises when you're in the moment. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea of a "bridge" between the point of taking action and the point of feeling stuck. My goal is to help you develop a small, immediate action that can help you stay connected to your value and momentum when the panic hits.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try setting a very small, immediate goal, like taking a deep breath or noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, and committing to do that one thing, just for 5 seconds, before moving on to the next step of sending the email?

Patient: I did it — I took a slow breath, planted my feet and counted five, and for a few breaths my chest loosened and my shoulders dropped. It only lasted seconds before that "not enough" voice crawled back and my hands went cold and I froze. I've tried breathing and grounding a hundred times — how is that supposed to help when my body just locks up? Tell me one concrete thing to do the instant the freeze hits — exactly what to do with my hands, my breath, or my focus — because vague stuff isn't cutting it.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're getting close to understanding the need for a concrete action to help manage the freeze, but you're still looking for a specific solution. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea of a small, deliberate movement that can help break the cycle of freeze. My goal is to help you find a concrete action that can help you get unstuck.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try placing your hands on a nearby surface, like a chair arm or your desk, and noticing the sensation of your hands touching the surface, without trying to do anything else, the instant your body freezes?

Patient: I can try that — put my hands on the arm of the chair and pay attention to the pressure and texture. For a few seconds it actually grounds me: the weight in my palms, the coolness, a tiny loosening — then this rush of shame and frustration hits and my muscles lock and I pull away. How is that supposed to stop the freeze? Give me an exact script: what do I do with my hands, how long do I hold them, and what do I say to myself in those first few seconds so I don't just shut down.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're getting close to making progress with the physical grounding exercise, but you're still struggling with the emotional response. I'd like to pivot to exploring the idea of a specific verbal phrase that can help you pause and breathe during the freeze. My goal is to help you develop a simple, consistent phrase that can give you a brief window to breathe and come back to action.

Therapist Answer:
When your body freezes, as soon as you feel the physical sensations, say to yourself, in a calm and gentle voice, "I am here. I am present. I am safe," and hold your hands on the arm of the chair for 5 seconds, without trying to do anything else.

Patient: I tried it — put my hands on the arm, said "I am here. I am present. I am safe" in a quiet voice, and held for five seconds. For those five seconds my breathing eased and my shoulders dropped a little, then this hot shame and frustration slammed back in, my muscles locked, and I pulled away. How is that supposed to stop the freeze when the shame still hijacks me like that? I'm willing to try, but I need a concrete, second-by-second script for what to do the instant that shame spikes — exactly what to do with my hands (press, squeeze, hold still?), how many breaths, what words to say next, and whether to keep my eyes open or close.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're making progress with the verbal phrase, but you're still struggling with the intense emotional response. I'd like to pivot to exploring a more concrete and nuanced approach that can help you manage the shame and frustration. My goal is to help you develop a specific physical action that can interrupt the cycle of freeze and shame.

Therapist Answer:
When the shame spikes, as soon as you feel the physical sensations, press your index finger and middle finger together, making a gentle fist, and hold it for 2-3 breaths, while saying to yourself, "This too will pass", keeping your eyes slightly open, but softly focusing on the sensation of your hands together, and when you release the pressure, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.

Patient: I tried that — I pressed my index and middle together, made a small fist, said "This too will pass," kept my eyes soft, and it eased for a breath or two, then the shame and frustration slammed back and I pulled away. How is that supposed to help when that rush feels like a physical shove right back into the freeze? Give me an exact, second-by-second script: how hard should I press (gentle, medium, hard?), count the seconds or breaths exactly, what do I say if my voice trembles, do I stay sitting or stand after the release, and what's the immediate next move so I don't just spiral back into panic. I'm willing to try it with precise steps, but I'm skeptical it will actually hold.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're making progress with the physical action, but you're still struggling with the intense emotional response. I'd like to pivot to exploring a more nuanced approach that can help you manage the shame and frustration. My goal is to help you develop a specific sequence of physical actions and verbal phrases that can interrupt the cycle of freeze and shame.

Therapist Answer:
When the shame spikes, as soon as you feel the physical sensations, press your index finger and middle finger together, making a firm fist, with a medium level of pressure, and hold it for 5-6 seconds, while saying to yourself, "This too will pass", in a soft but firm tone, with a slight tremble if needed, keeping your eyes soft and focused on your hands. As you release the pressure, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and immediately, look up and take a small, brief glance around the room, noticing 3-4 things you can see, like a chair, a book, a plant, and a clock, before returning your gaze to your hands and taking a gentle, slow breath in. The immediate next move is to take a small, gentle stretch, like uncrossing your legs or rolling your shoulders, without trying to do anything else, and simply sit back in your chair.

Patient: I tried that exactly — medium pressure for 5–6 seconds, said “This too will pass,” glanced around at three things, did a little stretch and sat back. It helped for a breath or two, then this hot shame slammed me and I jerked away like I always do — it all comes back and I feel like quitting. How is that supposed to stop the freeze when the shame returns so fast? Give me a concrete, second-by-second next move to actually get me to open and send that email — exactly what to say if my voice trembles or my hands shake, and what to do if I feel like pulling away.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're making progress with the sequence of physical actions and verbal phrases, but you're still struggling with the rapid return of shame. I'd like to pivot to exploring a more nuanced approach that can help you develop a sense of emotional resilience and stability. My goal is to help you develop a specific phrase and physical action that can help you reconnect with your goals and values.

Therapist Answer:
When the shame spikes again, as soon as you feel the physical sensations, say to yourself, "I am here, I am strong, I am enough," in a soft but firm tone, with a slight tremble if needed, while holding your hands gently but firmly in your lap, with your fingers curled around each other. If your voice trembles or your hands shake, focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, and say to yourself, "I can tolerate this," without judgment. If you feel the urge to pull away, gently press your hands back together, making a small fist, and say "I am strong," without trying to do anything else, and then slowly and deliberately open your eyes, look around the room, and take a slow, deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. The immediate next move is to take a small, slow action towards sending the email, like opening the attachment, clicking the send button, or typing a single word, without expecting perfection or control, but simply taking a small step towards your goal.

Patient: I tried that exact sequence — hand press, the phrase, the glance around — then opened the email and my chest slammed, my hands started to tremble, and I couldn't bring myself to hit Send. The shame just flooded back and I jerked away like I always do. I need a really specific, second-by-second script: exactly what line to type as the subject, one short sentence for the body, exactly where to rest my hands and how hard to press them, an exact phrase to say if my voice trembles, counts for breaths or seconds, what to do if I feel like closing the window, and what to do immediately after I press Send so I don't spiral. I know this is detailed, but vague fixes don't hold — how is this precise script supposed to actually keep me from freezing?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're struggling with the intense emotional response to the shame, and the previous sequence wasn't enough to support you in sending the email. I'd like to provide a highly detailed and nuanced script to help you manage the shame and frustration. My goal is to help you develop a specific, step-by-step sequence that can interrupt the cycle of freeze and shame.

Therapist Answer:
Here is the precise script:

**Step 1: Pressing hands**
 Hold your hands gently but firmly in your lap, with your fingers curled around each other, and press them together with a light to medium pressure (about 2-3 out of 10).

**Step 2: Verbal phrase**
Say to yourself, "I am here, I am strong, I am enough," in a soft but firm tone, with a slight tremble if needed, while focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

**Step 3: Glance around**
Take a brief glance around the room, noticing 3-4 things you can see, such as a chair, a book, a plant, and a clock, without focusing on any of them.

**Step 4: Small action**
Take a small, slow action towards sending the email, such as:

* If typing, type the subject line: "Follow-up on my application" ( exactly 5 words).
* If not typing, take a moment to think about the email and what you want to say.

**Step 5: Body of email**
Type the body of the email in 2-3 sentences, such as:
"I am writing to follow up on my application for the position at XYZ company. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience. I would appreciate the chance to discuss further."

**Step 6: Hands**
 Hold your hands gently but firmly in your lap, with your fingers curled around each other, and press them together with a light to medium pressure (about 2-3 out of 10).

**Step 7: Verbal phrase**
Say to yourself, "I can do this," in a soft but firm tone, with a slight tremble if needed, while focusing on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body.

**Step 8: Send the email**
If you feel ready, press the Send button.

**Step 9: Immediate action**
Immediately after sending the email, take a small, slow action towards a related task, such as:

* Checking your email

Patient: I tried it exactly — hands in my lap, said the lines, glanced around, typed the subject and the two-sentence body — and right when I went to press Send the shame hit like a shove and my hands froze and I closed the window. How is that supposed to help when the shame still reclaims me every time? I need a concrete, second-by-second fallback for the moment I can’t press Send — exactly what to do with my hands, what to say to myself (if I can’t speak aloud), how many breaths or counts, and one tiny non-email action to do immediately so I don’t just bail.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're struggling to maintain progress despite the shame and frustration. I'd like to provide a fallback sequence to help you manage the shame and frustration when you're unable to press Send. My goal is to help you develop a specific, step-by-step sequence that can interrupt the cycle of freeze and shame.

Therapist Answer:
Here is the fallback sequence:

**Step 1: Hand position**
Immediately after closing the window, place your hands on the armrests of the chair, with your palms facing downwards, and press them together with a light pressure (about 2-3 out of 10).

**Step 2: Verbal phrase**
Say to yourself, "I am here, I am strong, I am enough" (if able to speak aloud), or "I am here, I am strong, I am enough" (if unable to speak aloud, and instead repeat the phrase silently).

**Step 3: Breathing**
Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6.

**Step 4: Non-email action**
Immediately take a small, slow action towards a related task, such as:

* Getting a glass of water
* Stretching your arms and shoulders
* Noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground

**Step 5: Re-evaluation**
Take a brief moment to re-evaluate your goals and motivations, asking yourself:
"What is the purpose of this email?"
"What is the value of sending it?"
"What would happen if I don't send it?"

This fallback sequence aims to provide a brief pause, re-centering you, and give you a chance to reassess your goals and motivations. It's essential to remember that it's okay to not be able to press Send immediately, and that this sequence is not a substitute for practicing ACT skills in a safe and comfortable environment.

Patient: I tried that exact fallback and the same thing happened — the shame smacks me so hard I yank my hands away and close the window. I need an even more literal, second-by-second script: exactly how many counts do I press my palms (1–2–3?), do I keep the draft open or minimize it, where do I rest my hands if they shake, what exact short phrase do I repeat if I can’t speak out loud, how long do I hold the breath counts, and if I still can’t send, what one tiny non-email action (set a 10‑minute timer to return? take one sip of water?) do I do immediately so I don’t bail and lose momentum. I’m trying to follow these steps, but how is this really supposed to stop that shove of shame when it hits?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It sounds like you're struggling to find a reliable way to manage the shame and frustration. I'd like to provide an extremely detailed and specific script to help you interrupt the cycle of freeze and shame. My goal is to help you develop a sequence that can provide a brief moment of safety and support.

Therapist Answer:
Here is the revised fallback sequence:

**Step 1: Hand position**
Immediately after closing the window, place your hands on the armrests of the chair, with your palms facing downwards, and press them together with a 1-count pressure (just a brief touch). Hold for 1 count.

**Step 2: Draft management**
Minimize the email draft window to reduce visual stimuli.

**Step 3: Verbal phrase**
Say to yourself, silently, "I am here" (repeating it 3 times, slowly and deliberately), and then immediately say "I am strong" (repeating it 3 times, slowly and deliberately).

**Step 4: Breathing**
Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, and breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of 6.

**Step 5: Hand placement**
Immediately rest your hands on the armrests, with your palms facing downwards, and gently squeeze them together with a 1-count pressure (just a brief touch).

**Step 6: Non-email action**
Take a small, slow action towards a related task, such as:

* Setting a 10-minute timer on your phone to return to the task later
* Noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground
* Taking one sip of water

**Step 7: Re-evaluation**
Take a brief moment to re-evaluate your goals and motivations, asking yourself:
"What is the purpose of this email?"
"What is the value of sending it?"
"What would happen if I don't send it?"

This revised sequence aims to provide a more precise and gentle approach to managing the shame and frustration. However, I want to acknowledge that shame is a complex and deeply ingrained emotion, and it may take time and practice to develop a reliable coping strategy. It's essential to remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and it's okay to seek support from a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try this, but that hot shame still slams into me and makes me yank my hands away. I need even more literal, second-by-second stuff so I don’t cave. If my hands shake when I go to press Send, do I rest my index finger on the button and count “1‑2‑3” and then press on 3, or do I press and hold for one second? Keep the draft minimized or leave it open? Say the phrases out loud or repeat them silently if my voice trembles? If my mind is racing, how strictly do I follow the 4‑4‑6 breath (do I count out loud or silently)? Right after I press Send, is the immediate action checking my inbox okay or should I do the 10‑minute timer and step away and, if so, exactly what tiny movement (one sip of water? stand and stretch once?) do I do in that first 10 seconds so I don’t spiral? And…can we try it now with you guiding me through each second so I don’t get left alone with the shove?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
I understand that you're struggling to find a reliable way to manage the shame and frustration. I'd like to guide you through the exercise with me, so we can work through it together.

Let's start again from the beginning. We'll go step by step, and I'll guide you through each second.

**Step 1: Hand position**
We're starting with your hands in your lap. Can you keep your hands still for a moment?

(pause for 1 second)

**Step 2: Draft management**
We're going to minimize the email draft window to reduce visual stimuli. Can you click on the "Minimize" button to reduce the window size?

(pause for 1 second)

**Step 3: Verbal phrase**
We're going to repeat the phrase "I am here" silently, 3 times, slowly and deliberately. Can you say "I am here" to yourself, and then "I am here" again, and again?

(say "I am here" silently, 3 times)

**Step 4: Breathing**
We're going to breathe in deeply through our noses, counting to 4. Can you inhale slowly and deeply, counting to 4 in your mind?

(inhale deeply, counting to 4 silently)

**Step 5: Hand placement**
We're going to rest your hands on the armrests, with your palms facing downwards. Can you place your hands on the armrests and gently squeeze them together with a 1-count pressure?

(place hands on armrests and squeeze together for 1 count)

**Step 6: Non-email action**
We're going to set a 10-minute timer on your phone to return to the task later. Can you set the timer for 10 minutes and take a moment to acknowledge that you've taken a small step?

(set timer and acknowledge the action)

Now, we're going to take a brief moment to re-evaluate your goals and motivations. Can you ask yourself:

"What is the purpose of this email?"
"What is the value of sending it?"
"What would happen if I don't send it?"

(pause for 1-2 seconds)

**Step 7: Pressing Send**
We're going to press the Send button. If your hands shake, can you rest your index finger on the button and count "1-2-3" and then press on 3? Or do you press and hold for one second?

(we'll decide on this together)
