Patient: I’ve been kind of stuck in this mode of analyzing everything instead of actually feeling it. I guess with the adjustment disorder and that health scare, I intellectualize my anxiety—turn feelings into facts so I don’t have to sit with them. I don’t know, talking about it feels really awkward and I keep wanting to change the subject.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you find yourself wanting to change the subject or avoid discussing your anxiety? What would you do instead if you could let go of the need to analyze everything?

Patient: Usually I drift into details — timelines, probabilities, medical stuff — and then steer things toward logistics so it doesn't get emotional. I don't know, I guess if I could let go I'd try to notice what my body feels, name the feeling, maybe breathe through it or write it down instead of turning it into a problem to solve. But that feels really vulnerable, and I end up saying "I don't know" or changing the subject before I even try.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to consider not knowing and being vulnerable. Can you think of a time when you didn't know what to do, but still took a small step forward, even though you were scared? What might happen if, for just a tiny moment, you allowed yourself to not have all the answers?

Patient: I guess one time after the health scare I was totally frozen but still made the specialist appointment even though I was panicking the whole week. Showing up felt...awkward, but afterwards I had this small relief, like the uncertainty loosened a little. I don't know, maybe if I let myself not have the answers for a bit I'd notice that relief sooner instead of turning everything into charts and probabilities.

Therapist: That small moment of relief after the appointment seems like a small victory. Can you imagine what would happen if, right now, you gave yourself permission to not know and simply allowed yourself to feel whatever arises without trying to analyze or fix it? What would that feel like?

Patient: I don't know... probably a weird mix — my chest would tighten, but maybe there'd be a small looseness too, like a knot easing a bit. I'd still want to grab for facts and probabilities to explain it away, but maybe there'd be a quiet relief underneath. I'm kind of nervous saying that — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to express your thoughts and feelings, especially when they're uncomfortable. I'm here to support you, not to judge. Can we take a deep breath together and say it out loud? What's the smallest, most tiny step you could take right now to slow down and allow yourself to feel whatever arises, without trying to analyze or explain it away?

Patient: Okay, I guess the tiniest step would be taking one slow breath and putting my hand on my chest to notice what that feels like. Then maybe quietly name the feeling — like "anxious" or "tight" — for like 20–30 seconds without trying to explain it. I don't know, that already feels kind of scary; can we keep it really short and go slowly?

Therapist: Let's focus on that small step: putting your hand on your chest and noticing the sensation for 20-30 seconds without trying to explain it. Can you take a deep breath in and put your hand on your chest right now, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: Okay... I took a slow breath and put my hand on my chest. It feels tight and fluttery, like a heavy knot, and my breathing gets a bit shallower even though I'm trying not to analyze it. I don't know, I keep wanting to turn it into reasons and probabilities, but I'm trying to just notice—it feels awkward and makes me anxious, so can we keep it really slow?

Therapist: Let's keep noticing the sensation of the knot and the feeling of the breath. Can you bring your attention back to the sensation in your chest, without trying to change it or explain it? Try to allow the sensation to be what it is, without judgment. What's the sensation like right now, without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: It's this tight, heavy knot under my sternum—kind of a dull pressure that also feels fluttery, and my breath gets shallower. I don't know, it makes me want to start explaining it away or list causes, so I'm trying not to, but it's awkward and I feel like changing the subject—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the knot under your sternum is still a bit of a puzzle for you. I want to gently encourage you to consider that the knot might be a signal that you need to slow down and be kind to yourself, rather than trying to solve it. What's one small thing you value that would help you feel more grounded and supported right now, even if it's just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I guess the smallest thing that would help is someone just naming how hard this is and sitting with me without trying to fix it—like, "that's really tough," and not jumping to solutions. I don't know, it feels weird to want that, but I think it would let the knot loosen a little. Can we just stay with that for a moment?

Therapist: I'm sitting here with you, and I can see that this is a really tough spot for you. It's okay to feel that way, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Can you imagine me simply stating that, without adding any solution or advice? Just acknowledging the difficulty, and being present with you in this moment?

Patient: Yeah... I guess that actually helps a bit — just hearing you say it's tough makes the knot feel a little less tight. I don't know, I still want to start explaining it away, but can we stay with this silence and that acknowledgement for a little longer?

Therapist: I'm glad that acknowledging the difficulty is helping. Let's stay with this silence and just be present with each other for a moment. Can you just notice the sensation of your breath, without trying to do anything with it? Noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or explain it?

Patient: Okay... I'm noticing the air moving in and out — a coolness at my nostrils, my chest rising a little, and that same tight knot under my sternum. I don't know, my mind keeps wanting to explain it or list reasons, but if I just notice it feels...a tiny bit calmer, I guess. Can we stay with this for a bit and keep it slow?

Therapist: I'm glad you're noticing the sensations and feeling a bit calmer. Can you think of a value that's important to you, something that's important to you in your life, and see if that might help guide your next steps? Not trying to change anything, just noticing what comes up for you.

Patient: I guess I really value my health and being competent—like getting through school without falling apart. So if that guides me, maybe a tiny next step is doing one short daily check-in (like 2–3 minutes) to notice the knot and name the feeling instead of turning it into a problem to solve; I don't know, saying that out loud already feels kind of vulnerable and awkward.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge your values and be willing to take small steps towards them. Can I ask, what's one thing you think would happen if you did take this daily check-in, even if it felt awkward or uncomfortable at first? Would it be a sense of relief, or something else?

Patient: I guess it'd probably give a little relief—like the knot loosens sooner and I don't immediately grab for facts. I don't know, maybe over time it'd make me less stuck in analysis and a bit clearer, but it still feels awkward and I'm kind of dragging through this, so can we keep it really simple?

Therapist: Let's keep it really simple. What if, for the next 2-3 minutes, you just committed to doing this daily check-in, without worrying about doing it "right" or "wrong"? No expectations, no judgment. Just showing up and noticing what's present. Can you take a tiny step towards that, right now?

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try that now. One slow breath, hand on my chest — it's still tight and fluttery, so I'll name it "anxious." It feels like a lot to do, but I can stick with this for a minute; can we keep it really short?

Therapist: Let's keep it even shorter. I'll take a deep breath and say it with you: "One tiny step is taking one slow breath in, and then putting your hand on your chest to notice the feeling." Can you do that with me, right now?

Patient: Okay... one slow breath, hand on my chest. It's tight and fluttery, my thoughts keep darting off and I feel kind of on edge, but I'm holding it for now — I don't know, maybe a tiny bit calmer.

Therapist: Can you think of a physical anchor point that you can come back to whenever you feel like you're getting caught up in thoughts again? Something that's simple, like your breath, or your feet on the ground, or a sensation in your body?

Patient: I guess the simplest anchor for me is the weight of my feet on the floor, or my hand on my chest — but if I have to pick one, I'll say my feet. I don't know, focusing on how they press into the ground feels steadier than my racing thoughts, even if my mind keeps darting. Can we... keep it slow?

Therapist: Let's stay with your feet on the ground. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just notice the sensation of the weight of your feet, and see if that helps you feel more grounded.

Patient: Okay... my feet feel heavy against the floor, like they're anchoring me a bit. My chest is still tight and my mind keeps darting to other things, so I don't know—focusing on my feet helps a little, but it's hard to hold; can we just stay with this quietly for a minute?

Therapist: Let's just stay with your feet on the ground for a minute, quietly. If your mind starts to wander, that's okay. You can simply acknowledge the thought and bring your attention back to the sensation of your feet. No need to try to stop the thoughts, just allow them to pass.

Patient: Okay... I'm keeping my attention on my feet — they feel heavy against the floor — but my chest's still tight and my thoughts keep darting off. I don't know, it's hard to hold, but I can stay with it for like thirty seconds more if we keep it quiet and slow.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and count to thirty with me, while keeping your attention on your feet on the floor. When we get to thirty, we can slowly come back to whatever's present. Ready?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. Deep breath—1...2...3... my mind's already darting and my chest's tight, so I don't know if I can make it to thirty. Can we slow it to ten? I can hold that.

Therapist: That's okay, we can slow down. Let's take a deep breath together and count to ten: 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10. When we get to ten, we'll come back to whatever's present. Notice how you're doing, and be kind to yourself if your mind wanders.

Patient: Okay... I made it to ten. My chest's a tiny bit looser and my feet helped, but my mind keeps darting and it's kind of draining to stay with it. I don't know, I guess can we hang on a bit longer and keep it really slow?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and commit to staying with this for just one more minute, without trying to control it. Can you imagine a warm, comforting light filling your body, and notice how that feels? No need to do anything, just be present with that sensation.

Patient: It's like a soft, warm pressure spreading from my chest to my shoulders and a tiny bit of the knot eased—like a small looseness under the tightness. My mind keeps darting away though and it feels kind of wearing to hold it, so I don't know if I can stay focused for long. Can we keep it really slow and just... stay with this for a bit longer?

Therapist: You're doing great. I'm proud of you for staying with it for as long as you have. Let's take a deep breath together and ask ourselves: what's enough for you right now? Is it holding this feeling for one more minute, or can you stop now and take a small step away from the discomfort?

Patient: I don't know if I can manage a whole minute — I'm kind of drained. I can stay with it for like thirty more seconds if we keep it really slow, and then I need to step away and do something tiny, like get a glass of water and write one sentence about how the knot felt. That feels... manageable, I guess.

Therapist: You've done a great job staying with it this far. I think that's enough for now. Let's take a deep breath together and commit to taking care of your physical needs. Why don't you go get a glass of water and take a moment to write down one sentence about the knot you felt, without trying to analyze it or change it? What comes to mind?

Patient: I don't know, I guess the sentence I'd write is: "There's a tight, fluttery knot in my chest that keeps pulling my breath shallow." I can go get water and write that down, but my mind's jittery and it feels like a lot—can we keep it slow when I come back?

Therapist: Take your time getting the water and writing down your sentence. When you return, we'll come back to it at a slow and gentle pace. Let's focus on your breath and the sensations in your body, without trying to analyze or change anything. Can you just notice how you're feeling right now, without judgment?

Patient: I notice my chest is still tight and my breath's shallow, and there's this jittery, distracted feeling in my stomach and head—my thoughts keep darting to reasons. I don't know, I'm kind of on edge and it's exhausting; I guess I want to stay with it but it's hard. Can we keep it really slow and just notice this for a little while longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and focus on noticing the sensations in your body, without trying to change or analyze them. Can you gently ask yourself: What's happening in this moment, without trying to label it or fix it? Can you simply observe the sensations, like a gentle stream flowing, without trying to grasp or control it?

Patient: I don't know... when I ask that I notice the tight knot in my chest, shallow quick breaths, and this jittery feeling in my stomach, and my thoughts just dart off to reasons. I can sort of watch them like a stream passing, but it's exhausting to stay with it and I keep wanting to change the subject—can we keep this really slow?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that this experience, with all its sensations and thoughts, is what's present right now. It's okay that it's exhausting, and it's okay that you want to change the subject. Can you simply allow this experience to be what it is, without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: I can try. I don't know, letting it be feels weird and kind of overwhelming—my chest's still tight, breaths are shallow, and my thoughts keep darting to reasons. I guess I can sit with it for a bit longer if we keep it really slow and quiet.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can, right now. It's okay if it feels weird or overwhelming. Can you simply notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, without trying to do anything with it? Just feel the weight of your body, and allow yourself to be present in this moment, exactly as it is.

Patient: Okay... my feet feel heavy against the floor, like they're anchoring me a bit. My chest's still tight and my thoughts keep darting to reasons — I don't know, it's really wearing to hold them back, but I guess I can stay with this for another minute if we keep it slow.
