Patient: I'm a middle-aged nurse and since the kids left I've been feeling flat and totally unmotivated — my self-esteem's taken a nose dive. My head won't stop predicting the worst: I'm sure I'll never find meaning again, my partner will get tired of me and leave, and everything I worked for will crumble — it all feels inevitable. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't seem to stop those disaster stories.

Therapist: What's one thing that feels truly inevitable to you right now, and what would happen if, for just one day, you were able to let go of that inevitability and approach it with curiosity, rather than dread?

Patient: The thing that feels inevitable is that my partner will get fed up with this empty, sad version of me and leave — and then everything will cascade: they'll take the house, I'll be stuck paying bills alone, lose the routine that keeps me sane, and end up isolated and starting over in my sixties with nothing. I guess if I let go for one day I might notice small things — take a walk and actually enjoy it, call an old friend, try a class — and maybe that could soften things a bit. But honestly that feels unrealistic and making myself try it just makes me more overwhelmed; I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Therapist: It's understandable that waiting for the "other shoe to drop" feels overwhelming. Can you think of one small thing you'd be willing to try today, not to prevent the worst-case scenario, but simply because it feels meaningful to you, like reconnecting with an old friend, taking a short walk, or practicing a hobby?

Patient: I could try a short walk around the block and maybe call my friend Marcia. But I can already see it: it'll start raining, Marcia'll be busy, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will notice I'm still a mess and decide to leave — so it feels pretty pointless. Still, I guess a ten-minute walk might be tolerable, even if it probably won't change anything.

Therapist: Can you think of a small, everyday activity that, even if not particularly fulfilling, still brings you a sense of comfort or satisfaction, like making a cup of coffee or enjoying a favorite book?

Patient: Making a cup of coffee is the small thing that usually soothes me — the smell and the routine. But my brain immediately goes to worst-case: I'll spill it or burn it, look foolish, my partner will see it as proof I'm a mess and decide to leave, so even that tiny comfort feels pointless and I can't stop replaying the disaster.

Therapist: Can you try to observe the process of making coffee, without the need for a specific outcome, just for a few breaths, and see what happens to your experience of it?

Patient: I tried — I stood there and breathed while the kettle warmed and I focused on the steam and the smell for a couple of breaths. For a moment it felt quiet and almost normal, but then my brain immediately pictured me spilling the cup, looking ridiculous, my partner seeing it as proof I'm falling apart, and that being the moment they decide to leave. I want to hold on to that small calm, but honestly it already feels fragile and like a tease, which just makes me more frustrated.

Therapist: Can you allow yourself to be with the uncertainty of not knowing what will happen next, without trying to control or change the outcome? What would it be like to simply observe the present moment, with all its uncertainties, without judgment?

Patient: I try, but it feels like leaning into a void — for a few breaths there's a little quiet, then my fortune-telling brain fills the silence with my partner walking out, me losing the house, ending up alone. Letting uncertainty in tightens my chest because it feels like I'm inviting the disaster to happen. I'm trying to sit with it, but honestly it's exhausting and I don't know how to stay with it without spiraling.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the uncertainty is not about the partner walking out or the house, but about the space you're creating for yourself, right now, in this moment? What would it be like to hold the uncertainty as a possibility, rather than trying to avoid it?

Patient: I want that to be true, but my brain just won't let me — if I try to hold the space I can already see it unraveling: I get careless, my partner thinks I'm checked out, they leave, I lose the house and end up alone and humiliated. Maybe for a breath or two it would feel freeing, like I could try something small, but I can't trust that feeling — it just spirals into the disaster story and I dismiss the "possibility" idea as unrealistic.

Therapist: What if, rather than aiming for some idealized version of freedom or happiness, you were to take a small, imperfect action that doesn't necessarily lead to a specific outcome, but simply exists in the present moment?

Patient: Maybe I could try something small and imperfect — like make a messy loaf of banana bread or call Marcia and blurt out how I feel — but my brain already says it'll definitely go wrong: I'll burn it, look ridiculous, my partner will see it as proof I'm a wreck and leave, and then I'm stuck starting over at sixty. Saying I'll try makes me anxious and kind of resentful, like this will just be another setup for humiliation. I'm trying to do it, but honestly it feels pointless and I'm getting frustrated that we keep circling the same stuff.

Therapist: Can you think of a value that's connected to taking action, despite the fear of it going wrong, such as feeling seen, heard, or connected with others? What would it be like to take that imperfect action, not for the outcome, but for the value it might bring to you, even if it doesn't turn out as planned?

Patient: Maybe the value is feeling seen and less alone—like calling Marcia could make me feel heard even if it's clumsy. But my brain flips it: she'll be busy or judge me, my partner will overhear and decide I'm a liability, leave, take the house, and I'll be ruined—so trying for that feeling feels like marching straight into humiliation. I'm tired of this loop and honestly it's really draining to even consider it.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control the outcome of calling Marcia or taking action, you were to simply make a small commitment to yourself to reach out to her, without expectation of a specific response or outcome? Can you hold that small commitment without judgment, even if it feels a little uncomfortable?

Patient: I want to say yes—I could try to call Marcia and not expect anything—but my brain already scripts it: she'll be busy or pity me, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will overhear and decide I'm a lost cause and leave, and everything will fall apart. I can try to hold that tiny commitment today, but it'll feel fragile and I'll be judging myself the whole time; honestly I'm tired and frustrated we're circling this and not getting past the panic.

Therapist: Can you notice the thought that's arising right now, saying "you'll sound pathetic," and observe it as just a thought, without judgment? What would happen if you allowed that thought to pass, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I can hear that voice — "you'll sound pathetic" — and I can try to call it just a thought, but it doesn't land that way; it sounds like a prophecy. Sometimes if I let it pass for a few breaths there's a tiny relief, then my brain immediately fills in the rest: my partner overhears, they leave, I'm ruined. I'm trying to watch it go, but it keeps snapping back and honestly I'm getting more exhausted and frustrated by how stuck I am.

Therapist: Can you imagine that it's enough, simply to be in the present moment, without trying to control the outcome or prevent the thought that's arising? Would it be enough to take a small step towards calling Marcia, not because you're trying to avoid the thought, but simply because it feels like the right thing to do, even if it's scary?

Patient: I want that — it sounds like it would actually help to just make that tiny move toward calling Marcia, even if it's scary. But my brain's already scripting it: she'll be busy, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will overhear and that will be the final straw — so trying feels like signing up for humiliation. I could maybe commit to dialing and saying one sentence, like "Hey, can we talk?" then hang up if it goes sideways, but honestly I'm tired and frustrated we're circling and I don't know how to make it feel any less doomed.

Therapist: Can you commit to dialing Marcia's number right now, and say "Hey, can we talk?" without expecting a specific outcome or trying to control the conversation? Would it be enough, simply to take that small step, and see what happens next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If I actually dial she'll probably be busy or judge me, I'll sound pathetic, my partner might overhear and that becomes the moment they decide to leave, so it feels like I'm setting myself up for humiliation. I could press the number and say "Hey, can we talk?" but honestly I'm already dreading the fallout and tired of circling this.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the reason you're circling this situation is not because you want to avoid the potential negative outcomes, but because you're afraid of not being able to connect with Marcia, or being seen as vulnerable, or losing your partner's trust? What would it be like to take that small step towards connecting with Marcia, not for the potential outcome, but because you value the possibility of feeling seen and heard?

Patient: I suppose wanting to feel seen makes sense, but my brain instantly turns that into a catastrophe: Marcia will be busy or judge me, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will overhear and that becomes the moment they leave and take everything — so the "possibility" of feeling seen feels completely unrealistic. I could force myself to call and say "Hey, can we talk?" but honestly I'm confused about how risking that humiliation is supposed to help, and I'm tired and frustrated that we keep circling without it feeling any less doomed.

Therapist: Can you think of a time when you felt truly seen and heard by someone, and what was happening in your body and emotions during that moment? What would it be like to hold onto that feeling, not as a reward for taking action, but simply as a possibility that you can access in the present moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is remembering that supposed to help? The last time I felt truly seen was after a rough night shift when a coworker sat with me while I cried about the kids leaving; my shoulders unclenched, my chest loosened, and I felt oddly lighter for a few minutes. But even thinking about it now, my brain jumps to: that relief won't last, my partner will notice I'm fragile and decide to leave, and everything collapses — so holding onto that memory just feels fragile and then I get exhausted and pissed that we keep circling this.

Therapist: Can you observe the memory of feeling seen and heard by your coworker, without judgment, and notice what's happening in your body and emotions when you hold onto it? Is it the same feelings of relief, lightness, and calm that you had before, or are there other emotions arising?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing this supposed to help? When I bring that memory up, for a few seconds my shoulders loosen, my chest feels a little lighter and there's this small warm relief. But it never stays—my brain immediately turns it into a setup for disaster (partner sees me fragile, leaves, takes everything), and the warmth snaps into tightness in my chest, a knot in my stomach, and this exhausted, pissed-off frustration that even a good memory becomes proof the worst is coming.

Therapist: Can you allow yourself to hold onto the warm, light feeling in your chest, without trying to change it or control it? What would it be like to simply be with that feeling, without judgment, and see what happens next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I can try holding it: for a breath or two my chest actually lightens, my shoulders drop, and it feels like maybe, for a second, something okay could exist. But almost instantly my brain insists that feeling is the setup—the partner sees I'm fragile, they leave, they take everything—and I get tight and pissed off and exhausted that this keeps happening.

Therapist: Can you try to let go of the need to control the feeling of emotional stability, and instead, simply be with the feeling of your chest lightening, your shoulders dropping, and your body relaxing? What would it be like to allow yourself to be with that feeling, without judgment, and see what happens next?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I tried it for a breath and my chest actually did lighten and my shoulders dropped and it felt almost peaceful, like maybe something okay could exist. But my brain immediately predicts the rest — that tiny peace will show my partner I'm fragile, they'll leave and take everything — and the calm snaps away into panic and anger. I'm trying to hold it but I'm getting so tired and pissed off that this keeps happening.

Therapist: Can you consider that your worth and strength aren't defined by your ability to maintain a calm or stable emotional state, but by your willingness to be with your emotions, even the uncomfortable ones? What would it be like to approach your emotions with kindness and curiosity, rather than trying to control or avoid them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how does being kind to my emotions stop the domino? I can imagine trying curiosity for a minute and maybe feeling a little less tight, but my brain immediately calls that softness "weakness" and tells me my partner will see it and leave and then everything falls apart. I'm trying to be open to being kinder to myself, but honestly I'm exhausted and pissed that every time I try it just flips into another disaster story.

Therapist: Can you imagine that kindness to yourself is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of courage? What would it be like to approach your emotions with kindness, not to avoid them, but to acknowledge them as a natural part of being human?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? If I try to be kind to myself my brain screams that's weakness and then of course my partner will notice, get fed up, leave, take the house, and I'll be ruined. I want to believe kindness is brave, but right now it just feels like stepping off a cliff and I'm tired and pissed that we keep circling this.

Therapist: Can you look at the thought that kindness to yourself is weakness, and challenge it by asking, "What would I say to a friend in a similar situation?" Would you tell them they're weak if they're struggling to be kind to themselves, or would you offer them kindness and compassion?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'd tell a friend to be gentle with themselves, that kindness is brave and they'd deserve support. But with me it feels different: my brain says being kind is weakness and I can already see the chain — partner notices, gets fed up, leaves, takes the house, I'm ruined. I know that sounds irrational, but I can't seem to believe the kinder view, and I'm tired and pissed we keep circling this.

Therapist: Can you notice the difference between the way you talk to a friend and the way you talk to yourself? Is it the same tone, the same language? What would happen if you were to speak to yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you offer to your friend?

Patient: It's totally different — I tell friends to be gentle, but I talk to myself like I'm announcing my own collapse. If I tried to meanfully say kind things to myself my brain would scream weakness and I can already see the chain: partner notices, gets fed up, leaves, takes everything — so even trying feels like stepping into a trap. I'm getting really tired and pissed that we keep circling this and it doesn't feel any less doomed.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the possibility of being seen as vulnerable or weak is not the same as the reality of your life. What would it be like to take a small step towards connecting with Marcia, not to prove anything to anyone, but simply because it feels meaningful to you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is calling Marcia supposed to keep the rest from happening? If I reach out she'll probably be busy or pity me, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will overhear and that becomes the final straw, and then everything collapses — so it just feels like signing up for humiliation. Part of me wants to feel seen and I do kind of want to try, but honestly I'm tired and pissed that we keep circling and nothing feels any less doomed.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the only thing holding you back from reaching out to Marcia is the fear of being seen as vulnerable. What would be the smallest, most tiny action you could take to reach out to her, not to prove anything to her, but simply because it feels meaningful to you, and what would be the worst that could happen?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? The tiniest thing would be texting one line: "Hey Marcia, can we talk?" and leaving it at that. But my brain already scripts the worst: she'll be busy or pity me, maybe not reply, my partner will notice the message or hear me sounding weak, decide I'm a liability and leave, take the house, and I'll be stuck rebuilding my life at sixty with nothing. I'm totally hooked on that chain and it's exhausting and makes me pissed off that we keep circling it.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the idea of reaching out to Marcia is not about being vulnerable or seeking validation, but about reconnecting with a friend who has been a source of comfort and support in the past? What would it be like to approach the text message as a gesture of connection, rather than a means to an end?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is thinking of it as just a connection supposed to help? My brain immediately flips it: Marcia'll be busy or roll her eyes, I'll sound pathetic, my partner will overhear and that'll be the moment they decide to leave and take everything. I get the idea in theory, but it feels totally unrealistic and I'm tired and pissed that every small step seems like a setup for disaster.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the act of sending a text message to Marcia, without expecting a specific response or outcome, is an act of bravery in itself? What would it be like to approach this small action with a sense of curiosity and openness, rather than trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I can see that in theory — but my brain immediately turns it into disaster: I text, she doesn't reply or pities me, my partner sees me as fragile and uses it as the final straw to leave and take everything. Maybe sending it would give a tiny flicker of hope or relief, but honestly I'm tired and pissed we've circled this so much and it still feels totally doomed.
