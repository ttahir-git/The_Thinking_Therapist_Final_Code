Patient: Lately I've been getting more angry and snappy than I used to, especially with people since I started this demanding new job/program — everything feels like it sets me off. I'm an older manager, dealing with grief, and losing my temper over small things is wearing me out. I've tried therapy before, so honestly — how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's triggering these feelings of anger and frustration? Is there something specific in your job, work environment, or daily interactions that sets you off, or is it more of a general feeling that's building up inside you?

Patient: Mostly it's specific things — being interrupted in meetings, younger colleagues second-guessing me, and the constant tech glitches and emails that make me feel useless, and those little things just set me off. Then there's the grief — anniversaries or reminders sneak up and add to the pressure, so it becomes this steady build-up. I've tried breathing and counting and even other therapy before and it doesn't stick — how is that supposed to help now? I'm also just tired a lot, which makes everything feel bigger than it should.

Therapist: I can see how those triggers can be really challenging. Instead of trying to manage your emotions through specific techniques like breathing or counting, let's explore the possibility of creating some space between yourself and your reactions. What if, when you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, you could allow yourself to have that feeling, rather than trying to change it?

Patient: Allow the feeling instead of changing it? How is that supposed to help—just sitting with it doesn't stop me from snapping at someone across the table. I want to believe that could work, but in a meeting when a young colleague talks over me I don't get time to "allow" anything — I just flare up. Can you give a really concrete example of what I’d do in that moment so I don't look like a grumpy old manager?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment: when you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, take a brief pause before responding to the young colleague. Notice the physical sensations in your body, the thoughts racing through your mind, and the emotions rising up. Say to yourself, "Ah, I'm feeling angry right now," or "That's a strong feeling coming up." Then, before responding, pause for a brief moment, and say, "I'm going to take a deep breath and respond with kindness." This doesn't mean you have to be nice, but rather that you're taking a moment to acknowledge your emotional state before reacting.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea, but seriously — how is quietly telling myself "I'm feeling angry" in the middle of a meeting actually going to stop me from snapping? I've tried pausing before and it still ends up with me cutting in. What's a short, professional line I could use right then so I don't look like a grumpy old manager, and what do I do if someone talks over me and I literally don't get a second to breathe?

Therapist: Let's focus on what you value in that moment. When you feel yourself getting angry, ask yourself, "What's most important to me in this situation?" For example, "I value being respected and heard by my team" or "I value making progress on this project." Use a simple phrase like, "I appreciate your input, let's move forward" or "Can we take a moment to clarify before we continue?" This approach shifts the focus to your values and goals, rather than reacting to the emotional trigger. If someone talks over you and you don't get a chance to respond, you could say, "Excuse me, can I add something?" or "May I finish my thought?" to refocus attention on the conversation.

Patient: Okay, I can try something like "Excuse me, may I finish my thought?" — but how is that supposed to land without sounding weak or petty? I've tried polite lines before and people just steamroll me, especially when I'm tired or distracted; give me two or three short, firm phrases I can use in the moment and what to do if they keep talking over me.

Therapist: Here are three short, firm phrases you can use in the moment: 

1. "I'd like to contribute to this discussion."
2. "I'd like to clarify before we move forward."
3. "Let me add something to the conversation."

These phrases are direct, yet still polite, and convey your need to be heard. If someone continues to talk over you, you can say, "I understand you're speaking, but I'd like to contribute to this discussion. Could I please finish my thought?" or "I'm happy to continue, but I'd like to add something before we proceed." Use a firm but respectful tone, and maintain eye contact to convey confidence and authority.

Patient: Alright, I can try those, but how is that supposed to help when I'm already fuming? I need something firmer that doesn't make me sound petty or like I'm clinging to authority — give me exact wording and the tone (calm, sharp, short?) and what I do next if they keep talking. Also — what about when it's an email or a younger colleague undermining me in private? I'm getting a bit tired just thinking about handling all this, can we slow down and walk through one clear, repeatable script I can actually use?

Therapist: Let's focus on a single, concise phrase that you can use in various situations. Here's a script:

"[Name], I appreciate your input. I'd like to discuss [specific issue] and make sure we're aligned on [key point]. Can we take a moment to review the facts and move forward?"

Tone: Calm and assertive. Aim for a neutral, even tone that conveys confidence without being aggressive.

Sharpness: Use a direct, clear language that gets your point across without being confrontational.

For situations where someone is undermining you in private, a similar script could be:

"[Name], I appreciate your feedback, but I'd like to discuss this further with [me/our team] to ensure we're on the same page. Can we agree to review this before we proceed?"

This script acknowledges the person's input, expresses your need to discuss the issue further, and sets clear boundaries.

If the person continues to talk over you or undermine you, you can say:

"I appreciate your perspective, but I need to [insert specific action, e.g., review the email, clarify the facts]. Can we focus on [specific goal]?"

Remember to stay calm, maintain eye contact, and use a firm but respectful tone. If necessary, take a moment to collect yourself before responding, and prioritize de-escalating the situation.

Repeat this script several times, and practice it in low-stakes situations to build confidence and comfort with the language and tone.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to work with that, but honestly — how is repeating a polite paragraph in my head supposed to make me stop snapping when I'm already fuming? I need something even shorter I can actually blurt out without sounding like I'm reading a memo. Give me two ultra-short lines (one for meetings, one for private pushback), the exact tone (calm/firm/short?), and then one clear next step if they keep talking over me — like do I raise it with HR, call them out, or walk away? I’m getting tired just thinking about all the scenarios, can we slow down and role-play one of them so I can see how it feels?

Therapist: Here are two ultra-short lines:

**In a meeting:**
"I'd like to add to that."

**In a private situation:**
"I'd like to clarify."

Tone: Firm. Aim for a clear, direct tone that conveys confidence without being aggressive.

If someone keeps talking over you, take a clear next step:

* If it's in a meeting: Interrupt calmly and politely, "Excuse me, I'd like to add to that." If they continue to talk over you, consider taking notes or asking to summarize before responding. You can also politely excuse yourself to discuss with HR or the facilitator if the behavior continues.

**Role-playing exercise:**
Let's simulate a scenario where a younger colleague talks over you in a meeting. I'll play the role of the colleague, and you can practice responding with the ultra-short lines.

"Hey, I have an idea – "

Go ahead and respond with "I'd like to add to that."

Patient: "I'd like to add to that."

Okay—I said it, but I could feel my jaw clench. How is that supposed to stop me when they just keep talking? Can we try it again with you continuing like they ignore me so I can see the next move?

Therapist: Let's try it again. I'll play the role of the colleague who ignores you.

"I'd like to add to that."

(I continue speaking without acknowledging your attempt to contribute)

Now it's your turn again. Remember to notice your physical sensations and emotions, and respond with a clear, calm tone. Try using the phrase again, or introduce the ultra-short line "I'd like to clarify."

(continue as before)

Take your time, breathe, and respond when you're ready.

Patient: Alright, I try again: "Excuse me, I'd like to finish my point." My jaw's clenching and my heart's racing — I can feel the heat in my face. But honestly, how is that supposed to get me heard if they just steamroll me? Can we do it again where you ignore me so I can see the next move?

Therapist: Let's try it again. I'll ignore you for a moment, and then respond with a brief, assertive statement.

(I ignore you for a moment)

You try again: "Excuse me, I'd like to finish my point."

(I respond, but respond in a tone that dismisses your attempt)

Now, I'll acknowledge your frustration and offer a new approach.

"I can see that you're upset. Let's take a step back and focus on what's important. What's the key takeaway from our discussion so far?"

Notice how the conversation has shifted? The goal isn't to win an argument or be heard in the moment, but to refocus on the value-driven conversation. This approach helps you manage your emotions and maintain a calm tone.

Take a deep breath, and remember that it's okay to acknowledge your emotions and adjust your approach as needed.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when they just keep dismissing me? If I "refocus" it feels like I'm conceding or letting them steamroll the meeting. I can feel my jaw clench and my face get hot just thinking about it. Can we role-play again where you keep talking over me and this time show me the exact one-line I blurt out next, the tone (calm/firm/sharp), and the immediate follow-up if they still ignore me — and then one quick thing I do after the meeting so it doesn't just blow over? I'm tired, so can we slow down and do it step-by-step?

Therapist: Let's try it again. I'll keep talking over you, and you'll respond with a new one-line that prioritizes your needs.

(I start speaking, interrupting you)

Now it's your turn: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

Tone: Firm, but not aggressive. Aim for a direct tone that conveys your need to be heard.

Immediate follow-up: If I ignore you, you'll say, "I'd like to summarize to ensure we're aligned."

(I respond, and then ignore you again)

You say, "To summarize, I'd like to reiterate my point that...".

(I ignore you, and you take a moment to gather yourself)

Quick action after the meeting: As you leave the meeting, take a moment to reflect on what happened. Ask yourself, "What was my goal for this meeting?" and "Did I achieve it?" This reflection can help you adjust your approach and prioritize your values in future meetings.

Patient: Okay—let’s slow down, I’m getting worn out just thinking about this. Do the role-play again: interrupt me and ignore when I try the line, “I need to make sure we’re clear on this point.” If you keep talking over me, I’ll say, “I’d like to summarize to ensure we’re aligned.” Tone: calm, firm, short — put emphasis on “need” and “summarize.” 

Also give me one sentence I can use right after the meeting to address it in person, and a two-line email template I can send so it doesn’t just blow over. Then start the role-play with, “Hey, I have an idea—” so I can practice.

Therapist: Let's try the new approach. I'll interrupt you with a statement, ignore you, and then respond with a firm, calm tone.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

You respond: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You say, "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

You say, "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I finally acknowledge your need and respond)

Now, after the meeting, you can address the issue in person with: "Hey, I wanted to touch base with you about our discussion today. I felt like I wasn't fully heard, and I'd like to make sure we're aligned on our next steps."

As for the email template, here's a two-line template:

Subject: Clarification on [Topic]

Dear [Name],

I wanted to follow up on our discussion today regarding [Topic]. I'd like to confirm that we're aligned on [specific point].

Best,
[Your Name]

This email template conveys your need to clarify the point and ensure you're aligned with your colleague, without being confrontational or aggressive.

Let's try it again. Remember to stay calm, firm, and focused on your need to summarize and ensure alignment.

Patient: "Hey, I have an idea—"

"I need to make sure we're clear on this point." (My jaw's clenched, heart racing — I can feel heat in my face.)

(They ignore me, so I say it again, firmer) "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(Still ignored) "I'd like to summarize to ensure we're aligned."

One-sentence to use after the meeting in person:
"Can we touch base for a minute? I felt I wasn't fully heard and want to align on next steps."

Two-line email template:
Subject: Clarification on [Topic]
Hi [Name], following today's meeting I want to confirm we're aligned on [specific point]. Please let me know if that matches your understanding.

But honestly — how is that actually going to stop me from snapping if they just steamroll me? Can we role-play again where you keep ignoring me and then escalate, so I can practice the exact next move step-by-step? I'm getting tired thinking about all this, so please slow it down.

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again, this time escalating the situation to simulate a more challenging scenario. I'll ignore you, and then respond with a confrontational tone to simulate a "steaming-rollover" response.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

You respond: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You say: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I get defensive and interrupt you again) "Oh, come on, you're not going to change my mind, just move on."

You respond: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I raise my voice and interrupt you again) "Look, just accept what I'm saying and we can move forward!"

Now, after the meeting, you can address the issue in person with: "Can we touch base for a minute? I felt I wasn't fully heard and want to align on next steps."

As for the email template, the previous one still works, but we can try a new one: 

Subject: Concern about our meeting

Hi [Name], I wanted to discuss our meeting today and express my concern that I didn't feel fully heard. Can we schedule a follow-up meeting to review and align on next steps?

This email template is more direct and assertive, while still being professional.

Let's try it again. Remember to prioritize your emotional regulation and stay calm, firm, and focused on your needs.

Patient: "Hey, I have an idea—"

"I need to make sure we're clear on this point." (My jaw's clenching, my face is hot — I can feel that old, stupid shame creeping in like I always mess this up. How is this actually going to help?)

(They get louder and dismissive) "Oh, come on, you're not going to change my mind, just move on."

"I need to make sure we're clear on this point." (firmer, shorter)

(They keep talking over me, raising their voice) "Look, just accept what I'm saying and we can move forward!"

New escalation line (calm, firm, short — emphasis on "respectfully"): "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup."  
Immediate follow-up if they ignore or escalate: stand, say "Let's take this offline" and either ask the meeting lead to pause or arrange a 1:1 after the meeting; if the behavior persists, document what happened and raise it with the meeting facilitator or HR.

One-sentence to use right after the meeting in person: "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps."  
Two-line email template:  
Subject: Follow-up on today’s meeting  
Hi [Name], I felt my points weren't heard in our meeting — can we schedule 15 minutes to align on [specific point]? Thanks, [Your Name]

But honestly — how is saying "let's pause" supposed to stop the hot flush and the urge to snap when I'm already humiliated? I'm worn out thinking about this. Can we role-play it again where you ignore me twice and then escalate so I can practice that escalation line and the follow-through step-by-step? Please go slowly.

Therapist: Let's try the role-play again, this time simulating a more intense escalation. I'll ignore you twice and then respond with a confrontational tone. We'll practice your escalation line and the follow-through step-by-step.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

You respond: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You say: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I get defensive and interrupt you again) "Oh, come on, you're not going to change my mind, just move on."

(I get louder and more aggressive) "Look, just accept what I'm saying and we can move forward! You're always so uptight!"

Now, practice your escalation line: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup."

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

You say: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup."

(I respond with anger and condescension) "Oh, so now you're trying to control the conversation? Fine, I'll talk over you then."

You stand up and say: "Let's take this offline."

(I respond with anger and frustration) "Whatever, just leave me alone!"

You follow up with the meeting lead or facilitator, or arrange a 1:1 meeting to discuss the incident.

After the meeting, you can use: "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps."

As for the email template, it's a good start. We can refine it to make it more direct and assertive: 

Subject: Follow-up on today's meeting

Hi [Name], I wanted to address the concern that I felt my points weren't heard during our meeting. Can we schedule a follow-up call to review and align on [specific point]? I appreciate your attention to this matter.

Let's take it one step at a time. Remember to prioritize your emotional regulation, and don't hesitate to take a pause or seek support if needed.

Patient: Okay — that landed weirdly. Saying that escalation line makes my jaw clamp shut and this old, stupid sinking feeling comes up like I always fumble these moments. How is this actually going to stick when that shame and heat hit and I either freeze or snap? Can we slow down and do the role-play again step-by-step — you ignore me twice and escalate, and I practice the exact escalation line, the stand-up move, the tone and body language, then the one-sentence in-person follow-up and the two-line email? I'm tired, so please go slowly.

Therapist: Let's start again, taking it one step at a time. We'll simulate the scenario, and you can practice your response.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

Your turn: You respond with "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." Take a deep breath and notice your physical sensations.

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You feel yourself starting to feel frustrated, but you pause for a moment. You take a deep breath and practice the escalation line: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup."

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

You feel the heat and shame rising up. You stand up, using a calm and assertive tone: "Let's take this offline." As you stand up, maintain eye contact, and keep your body language open and confident.

(I respond with anger and frustration) "Whatever, just leave me alone!"

You respond with a calm, assertive tone: "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps."

(I'm taken aback, and the situation is defused)

Now, let's practice the email template: 

Subject: Follow-up on today's meeting

Hi [Name], I wanted to address the concern that I felt my points weren't heard during our meeting. Can we schedule a follow-up call to review and align on [specific point]? I appreciate your attention to this matter.

As we practice, remember that it's okay to take a pause or seek support if you need it. You're doing great, and we'll take it one step at a time.

Patient: Alright… that felt a little better, but it still drags up that same sick, sinking shame like I always mess these up. How is repeating the lines and pausing actually going to stop me from snapping when my jaw clenches and my face heats up? Can we do it again, really slowly this time — you ignore me twice and escalate, and talk me through the exact tone, how I stand/move/look, then the one-sentence in-person line and two-line email, step by step?

Therapist: Let's start again, really slowly. We'll simulate the scenario, and I'll guide you through each step.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

Your turn: You respond with "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." Take a deep breath and notice your physical sensations. As you say this, look me in the eye, and maintain a calm, assertive tone. Your body language should be open and confident, with your shoulders relaxed and your head held high.

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You feel yourself starting to feel frustrated, but you pause for a moment. You take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then practice the escalation line: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup." As you say this, use a calm, assertive tone, and your body language should convey a sense of confidence and determination. Stand up straight, make eye contact, and keep your hands at your sides.

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

You feel the heat and shame rising up. Your jaw clenches, and your face starts to heat up. This is a normal response, but remember that you've practiced the escalation line and the stand-up move. Take a deep breath, and with a calm, assertive tone, say: "Let's take this offline." As you stand up, keep your body language open and confident, and make eye contact. Your tone should convey a sense of determination and assertiveness.

(I respond with anger and frustration) "Whatever, just leave me alone!"

As you stand up, you're now in a powerful position. You've asserted yourself and set clear boundaries. Take a deep breath, and with a calm, assertive tone, say: "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps." As you say this, keep your body language open and confident, and make eye contact.

(I'm taken aback, and the situation is defused)

Now, let's practice the email template: 

Subject: Follow-up on today's meeting

Hi [Name], I wanted to address the concern that I felt my points weren't

Patient: Alright — but honestly, how is this actually going to stop me snapping when that heat and shame floods in? Do it again, really slowly: ignore me twice and escalate, then coach the exact tone and how I should stand/move/look, the one-sentence in-person follow-up, and the two-line email — step by step. This is wearing me out, so please go slowly.

Therapist: Let's start again, really slowly. We'll simulate the scenario, and I'll guide you through each step.

(I start speaking, interrupting you) "Hey, I have an idea—"

Your turn: You respond with "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." Take a deep breath and notice your physical sensations. As you say this, look me in the eye, and maintain a calm, assertive tone. Your body language should be open and confident, with your shoulders relaxed and your head held high.

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

You feel yourself starting to feel frustrated, but you pause for a moment. You take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and then practice the escalation line: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup." As you say this, use a calm, assertive tone, and your body language should convey a sense of confidence and determination. Stand up straight, make eye contact, and keep your hands at your sides. Look me straight in the eye, but don't glare or scowl. Your tone should convey a sense of calm, but with a hint of firmness.

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

You feel the heat and shame rising up. Your jaw clenches, and your face starts to heat up. This is a normal response, but remember that you've practiced the escalation line and the stand-up move. Take a deep breath, and with a calm, assertive tone, say: "Let's take this offline." As you stand up, keep your body language open and confident, and make eye contact. Your tone should convey a sense of determination and assertiveness. Stand up straight, and take a small step forward. This shows that you're taking control of the situation.

(I respond with anger and frustration) "Whatever, just leave me alone!"

As you stand up, you're now in a powerful position. You've asserted yourself and set clear boundaries. Take a deep breath, and with a calm, assertive tone, say: "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps." As you say this, keep your body language open and confident, and make eye contact. Your tone should

Patient: Okay... slow. Do it exactly step-by-step so I can picture it.

1) First line (meeting): say, calm and even, eyes on them, small inhale first — "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." Body: shoulders down, hands relaxed, weight even on both feet. Tone: calm, firm, not loud.

2) If ignored — escalation line, lower pitch, firmer: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup." Stand up slowly, one small step forward, hands at your sides, steady eye contact. Don't glare — just hold space.

3) If they keep talking and get louder — stand fully, one small forward motion and say, steady and determined: "Let's take this offline." Point subtly toward exit or meeting lead. Walk out calmly; don't storm.

After meeting one-sentence (in person): "Can we step aside for a minute? I felt unheard and want to align on next steps." Say it quietly but firmly, close distance so it's private.

Two-line email:
Subject: Follow-up on today’s meeting
Hi [Name], I felt my points weren't heard — can we schedule 15 minutes to align on [specific point]? Thanks, [Your Name]

I can already feel that old sinking shame creeping up just thinking about it — how's this actually going to stop me from snapping when my jaw's clenched and my face is hot? I want to try, but this is wearing me out.

Therapist: Let's focus on one step at a time. We'll practice the first line, and then we can build upon it.

1. First line (meeting): Say, calm and even, eyes on them, small inhale first:

Imagine yourself in the meeting, facing the person who's interrupting you. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. As you exhale, relax your shoulders and let them drop. Keep your hands at your sides, with your weight evenly distributed on both feet. Look at the person, maintaining steady eye contact, but avoid glaring or staring aggressively. Your tone should be calm and firm, with a hint of assertiveness. Speak in a steady, measured pace, enunciating each word clearly.

Example:
"I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

Notice how you're maintaining calm, steady breathing, and a relaxed body language. You're not trying to force your way into the conversation, but rather, you're establishing a clear boundary.

We can practice the rest of the role-play in small steps. Are you ready to move on to the next step, or would you like to take a moment to process and breathe before we continue?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I tried the breath and the line in my head, but how is that actually supposed to help when my jaw clenches and that old sinking shame hits? I'm worn out just thinking about it. Yeah, let's keep going, but really slow: interrupt me like before so I can say the first line out loud and you ignore me once so I can feel how it lands.

Therapist: Let's start again, and this time, I'll interrupt you, and you can say the first line out loud. We'll take it slow, and I'll guide you through the process.

(I interrupt you)

You respond, "I need to make sure we're clear on this point."

(I ignore you and continue speaking)

Now, take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. As you exhale, relax your shoulders and let them drop. Keep your hands at your sides, with your weight evenly distributed on both feet. Look at me, maintaining steady eye contact, but avoid glaring or staring aggressively.

Notice how your jaw is feeling? Take a moment to acknowledge it, and then say the first line again, out loud: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." Pay attention to your tone, body language, and the physical sensations in your body.

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

Take another deep breath, and let's practice the escalation line: "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup." As you say this, stand up slowly, one small step forward, hands at your sides, steady eye contact. Don't glare, but hold space.

(I ignore you again and continue speaking)

Take a moment to acknowledge your physical sensations and emotional response. We'll continue from here, taking it slow and steady.

Patient: Okay... I said it out loud: "I need to make sure we're clear on this point." My jaw tightened, my chest jumped, but I kept my voice calm and even. You ignored me, so I breathed and said, "I won't continue until we can discuss this respectfully. Let's pause and regroup," stood up slowly with my hands at my sides, and then, when you kept talking, I said, "Let's take this offline," and moved toward the door.

But honestly — how is that supposed to stop me from snapping when that hot, sinking shame rolls in? This is wearing me out. Can we do it again, just the first line this time, and have you ignore me once so I can try it again? Slow.
