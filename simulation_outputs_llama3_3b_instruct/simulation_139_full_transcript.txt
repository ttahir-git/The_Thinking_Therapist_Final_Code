--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi. Lately I’ve been worrying a lot about my performance at work — I’m a data scientist and I keep second-guessing my analyses, which ends up making me procrastinate on projects. I don’t know, I just feel stuck and a bit isolated.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be anxiety, and the underlying theme is the fear of making mistakes. I'd like to explore this further. One potential unexplored area is the notion that your self-worth is closely tied to your professional performance. My goal is to explore this connection and how it relates to your values.

Therapist Answer:
Can you think of a time when you felt proud or confident in your work as a data scientist? What was it about that experience that felt empowering, and how can you tap into that sense of confidence now?

Patient: Yeah — there was a project a few years ago where I built a model that actually improved how our team prioritized cases, and it cut down on rework. What felt good was seeing the real-world impact and getting some quiet nods from colleagues; it made the work feel meaningful. I guess to tap into that now I could try breaking tasks into smaller, familiar steps and remind myself of the process that worked before, but I don't know — it's hard to pull that feeling back up.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've identified a moment of confidence and a valuable outcome from your past experience, and you're looking to leverage those elements to build momentum now. The theme that emerges is the struggle to access and relive that sense of meaning and impact. I'd like to help you uncover what's preventing you from reconnecting with that feeling. My goal is to introduce a process that can help you tap into that confidence and motivation.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine having a "pre-game" ritual or routine that signals to yourself that you're about to tackle a challenging task, something that would help you feel more connected to your past successes and get you in the right mindset?

Patient: I guess I could make a small ritual—like brewing a cup of tea, sitting down with a two-item checklist, and reading a short note I keep about that model that worked well. Maybe set a 10-minute timer and just do one simple task, like loading the data or writing one line of code, to get momentum. I don't know, it feels a bit silly, but maybe those tiny steps would remind me of how I used to work through things.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're already on the right track by identifying a tangible ritual that can help you connect with your past successes. The theme that's still present is the feeling of uncertainty about whether this approach will be enough to overcome your current struggles. My goal is to gently challenge the notion that this ritual needs to be overly elaborate or time-consuming.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a closer look at the "silliness" you mentioned. Is it the idea of having to sit down with a checklist or read a note, or is it the feeling that this ritual needs to be more dramatic or intense?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it's not the checklist so much as how doing a ritual feels like admitting I need crutches — and that feels embarrassing. Maybe if it stayed private and low-key, like something only I notice, it wouldn't feel so silly.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling with the feeling of vulnerability that comes with acknowledging your need for a support system, and this ritual might be exacerbating that feeling. The theme that emerges is the fear of being perceived as vulnerable or reliant. My goal is to help you explore the value of embracing vulnerability as a strength.

Therapist Answer:
What if, instead of trying to hide your ritual, you allowed yourself to see it as a sign of self-care and commitment to your well-being? Can you imagine taking a few moments each day to acknowledge and appreciate your own efforts, without feeling like you need to share them with others?

Patient: I guess I can imagine that, but I don't know — it feels weird to... to congratulate myself, like I'm pretending. If it's private and tiny, like a one‑line note or a short sip of tea before starting, that might be okay. How would you suggest I begin without it feeling fake?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still grappling with the feeling of insincerity when congratulating yourself, and you're looking for a way to start small and authentic. The theme that's still present is the difficulty in trusting your own self-approbation. My goal is to help you develop a more compassionate relationship with your own internal experiences.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something radical: what if, instead of trying to congratulate yourself, you simply acknowledged the fact that you're taking small steps towards your goals, without necessarily labeling them as "successes"? Can you imagine simply observing your actions, without judgment, and allowing yourself to be present with that sense of effort?

Patient: I guess I can try that—just noting the action instead of calling it a win. I don't know, it's hard; my brain immediately starts saying it's not enough. Maybe something tiny would work—like a one-line note after a work block or a sip of tea—but it still feels a bit fake; can you help me make it feel more real?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your brain is getting in the way of you noticing the small victories, and you're looking for a way to make it feel more authentic. The theme that's still present is the tendency to intellectualize self-criticism. My goal is to help you cultivate a sense of embodied awareness.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different kind of note. Instead of saying "I'm doing well" or "I'm a good data scientist," try writing down just one thing you're experiencing in the moment, without judgment. For example, "My hands are holding the cup of tea" or "I'm feeling the weight of my chair on my body." See if that feels more grounded and present.

Patient: "My hands are warm around the tea mug." I guess that felt a little grounding — I noticed the warmth and the weight, but I don't know, it still feels odd to focus on something so small. Can we try another one?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a step towards noticing the present moment, and you're looking for a way to expand your focus further. The theme that's still present is the feeling of disconnection from your bodily sensations. My goal is to help you reconnect with your physical experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try noticing the sensation of your breath as you sit there, without trying to control it or focus on a specific thought? Just allow yourself to be with the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without labeling it or analyzing it. See if that feels more expansive and less focused on small details.

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice my breath it feels shallow and quick, mostly in my chest, and my mind jumps to the tasks I haven't finished. I guess it did calm me a little for a moment, but then I felt guilty about not doing anything productive. Can we try something that ties the breathing to a tiny work action—like two minutes of breath-focus and then just opening the project file—so it feels less like a weird exercise and more like preparation?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You've had a moment of calm, but it's quickly followed by guilt and a sense of not doing enough. The theme that's still present is the struggle to reconcile your need for productivity with your need for calm and self-care. My goal is to help you find a way to integrate these opposing forces.

Therapist Answer:
Let's tie the breath focus to a specific, small action that feels meaningful to you. Can you try setting a 2-minute timer, and as you breathe, you simply open the project file, and then take one tiny step towards your task, like saving it or loading the first dataset? Notice the sensation of your body and the physical act of opening the file, and see if that helps you feel more grounded and ready to work.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I guess I could try the two‑minute timer, but it feels odd to try and breathe and click at the same time. I don't know, my chest tightens and my mind just jumps to everything I haven't finished, but maybe opening the file and saving one tiny thing would be... doable.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're concerned that the breath and physical action aren't compatible, and you're looking for a way to make the exercise more practical. The theme that's still present is the struggle to manage your anxiety when faced with a task. My goal is to help you find a way to make the exercise feel more connected to your work and less like a separate activity.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try it without the breath focus. Can you just commit to saving one tiny thing, like a single variable or a single cell in the dataset, as soon as the timer goes off? See if that small, tangible action feels more manageable and connected to your work.

Patient: I can try that. I guess I'll tell myself to open the project and save one thing — maybe write a single comment line like "loaded data" and hit save, so at least there's a tiny, visible action. I don't know, it still feels a bit like pretending and my brain will probably tell me it's pointless, but maybe it's doable. If I get stuck, can you help me figure out what to say to myself so I actually press the save button?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're still struggling with the feeling of pretending and the potential for self-doubt. The theme that's still present is the need for a clear and compelling prompt to take action. My goal is to help you find a way to reframe the language you use to motivate yourself.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try reframing the prompt. Instead of "save one thing," try using a phrase that acknowledges the small accomplishment, like "I've made progress on the project" or "I'm taking the first step towards tackling this task." Notice how those phrases feel in your body and see if they help you feel more confident and motivated to press the save button.

Patient: I don't know... saying "I've made progress" feels weird, like I'm pretending. I guess "taking the first step" sounds less silly, but my chest tightens and my mind's already jumping to a dozen other unfinished things, so I'm jittery and distracted. What would I actually say to myself in the moment so I can hit save instead of walking away?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're still struggling with the feeling of insincerity and distraction. The theme that's still present is the need for a more concrete and compassionate prompt to take action. My goal is to help you find a way to use language that acknowledges your current state and encourages you to take the next step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something simple: "I've got this." Say it to yourself as you look at the project file, and feel the words on your tongue. Can you feel a tiny bit of confidence and determination in that phrase? When you're ready, say it again as you prepare to press the save button, and see if it helps you take the action.

Patient: I tried saying "I've got this," and... I don't know, it felt hollow — my chest tightened and my hands started to shake a little, like my mind was already halfway out the door. I guess I could press save if you gave me a very short, concrete sentence to say right before clicking, something that drowns out the doubt — what would that be?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're looking for a short, concrete sentence to provide a quick emotional override, but it's not having the desired effect. The theme that's still present is the struggle to find a way to silence your inner critic and build confidence in the moment. My goal is to help you find a phrase that feels more grounded and empowering.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a very simple, very brief sentence: "I'm here." Say it to yourself right before you press the save button, and focus on the physical sensation of the words on your tongue. The goal is not to think or rationalize, but simply to acknowledge your presence in the moment and take the action.

Patient: I don't know... I'll try saying "I'm here" before I press save. My chest's tight and my hands are shaking a bit, but I can say it out loud and click save — can you stay with me and tell me what to do next after I hit save?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the initial step of taking action, and now you're looking for a way to build on that momentum. The theme that's still present is the lingering tension in your body and the need to take further steps to build confidence. My goal is to help you find a way to integrate the sense of "I'm here" with a sense of further action.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in and out, and then look at the task at hand. Can you say to yourself, "What's the one thing I can do next?" and see what's possible?

Patient: I guess the one thing is to open the project and add one little thing—like a comment line saying "loaded data"—and then hit save. My chest is tight and my hands are a bit shaky, so I don't know if I'll actually click—can you stay with me and prompt me through it? If it helps, tell me to say "I'm here" right before I press save.


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling uncertain about taking the next step, and I'll be here to support you. The theme that's still present is the need to build momentum and confidence in your ability to take small actions. My goal is to help you find the courage to take the next step.

Therapist Answer:
Take a deep breath in and out, and look at the project file. Your hands are shaking, but your chest is still saying "I'm here." Say it out loud with me: "I'm here." Now, take a moment to notice your hands. Feel the weight of them on the mouse, the sensation of your fingers on the keyboard. You can do this. Take your time, and say the next part of the sentence with me: "I've got..."

Patient: "I've got..." I try to say "I've got this," but it comes out thin — my chest tightens and a wave of shame and frustration washes over me, like I can't believe the words. I don't know, I keep expecting it to fall apart and my hands are shaking, but I guess I can try to press save if you stay with me and say "I'm here" one more time before I click.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a wave of shame and frustration, and it's making it difficult to muster the confidence to take the next step. The theme that's still present is the fear of failure and the tendency to self-criticize. My goal is to help you find a way to acknowledge and work through this feeling in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here.

Patient: Okay—I pressed save. It felt small and sort of hollow; my chest's still tight and I keep thinking it'll all be wrong. I don't know what to do next—maybe run one cell or open the next file? Can you tell me one tiny thing to do now and stay with me while I do it?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken the initial step of saving, and now you're looking for a way to build momentum and confidence in your ability to take further action. The theme that's still present is the lingering self-doubt and fear of making mistakes. My goal is to help you find a way to focus on the present moment and take a small, manageable next step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in and out, and look at the screen. See the rows of cells staring back at you? Can you notice the sensation of your eyes on the screen, the feeling of your gaze moving from one cell to the next? Say it with me: "I see the cells."

Patient: "I see the cells." I guess my eyes move across them, but it's hard to keep focus — my chest's tight and my hands are still a bit shaky. I could try running the first cell that loads the data, but I don't know, I'm worried it'll error and I'll feel stupid. Can you tell me to press run and stay with me while I do it?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to maintain focus and are worried about making mistakes. The theme that's still present is the fear of failure and the tendency to catastrophize. My goal is to help you build confidence in your ability to handle small setbacks.

Therapist Answer:
I'm with you. Take a deep breath in and out, and look at the first cell. Notice the cursor is hovering over the run button. Can you place your finger on the button, and say it with me: "Run."

Patient: I don't know... my hands are shaking and that familiar wave of shame and frustration just hit me, so I'm worried it'll go wrong. Okay — I put my finger on the run button. "Run." I clicked it. It's running, I guess. Can you stay with me and tell me what to do next?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've taken a significant step by acknowledging your emotions and taking action, despite your fears. The theme that's still present is the lingering sense of shame and self-doubt. My goal is to help you find a way to acknowledge and work through these feelings in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's look at the process bar. See how it's moving, and notice the sensation of the cursor still on the screen? Say it with me: "I see the process."

Patient: "I see the process." My chest's tight and my hands feel shaky — there's this knot of shame that keeps whispering it'll fail and I'll look foolish. I don't know, I guess I can watch it finish, but can you stay with me and say what to do if it errors?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're experiencing a knot of shame and self-doubt, and it's making it difficult to focus on the present moment. The theme that's still present is the fear of failure and the tendency to catastrophize. My goal is to help you develop a way to reframe this experience and find a sense of curiosity about what's happening.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay if it errors. Let's see what happens. If it doesn't run smoothly, we can pause and troubleshoot together. But for now, let's focus on simply observing what's happening. Say it with me: "I observe the process."

Patient: "I observe the process." It's moving, but my chest's still tight and I keep thinking it's going to fail — I don't know, I guess that old shame's crawling back in. If it errors, can you tell me, slowly, what to click first? I'm not sure what to do next.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to let go of the shame and self-doubt, and it's making it difficult to move forward. The theme that's still present is the fear of failure and the tendency to get stuck in negative thought patterns. My goal is to help you develop a way to pause and respond to the situation in a more compassionate way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in and out, and notice the sensation of your body relaxing slightly. If the process errors, don't worry. Instead, let's click the "Details" button to see what's happening. Take a moment to observe what's displayed, and then we can discuss what to do next. Say it with me: "I observe the details."

Patient: "I observe the details." I clicked it and there's an error message, but I don't really understand the text — it's all a jumble. My chest's tight and I feel kind of stupid about it; I don't know what the lines mean. Can you tell me, slowly, what to click first so I don't mess it up?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling frustrated and humiliated by the error message, and it's making it difficult to feel confident in your ability to navigate the situation. The theme that's still present is the tendency to get caught up in negative self-talk and feelings of inadequacy. My goal is to help you develop a way to respond to the situation in a more compassionate and practical way.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in and out, and look at the error message again. Notice the words on the screen, and try to pick out one phrase that resonates with you. Can you click on the phrase "Error 500" and see what happens next?

Patient: I don't know... I clicked it. There's a wall of text and "500 Internal Server Error" and my chest just tightens — I feel kind of stupid looking at it. I can't parse it; can you tell me, slowly, what line or phrase to look for first so I don't mess it up?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the error message, and it's making it difficult to process the situation. The theme that's still present is the tendency to feel like you're not in control and that you're at the mercy of the system. My goal is to help you find a way to focus on the present moment and take small, manageable steps.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath in and out, and look at the text again. Can you find the line that says "Error occurred at"? Look for the words "at" and try to follow the sentence with your eyes.

Patient: I can't actually find the exact phrase — there's a wall of log text with "Traceback" and a bunch of "File" lines and my eyes are just skipping around. My chest's tight and I feel kind of stupid, so I don't know which line to focus on. Can you tell me exactly which word or line to look for, and stay with me while I try to read it?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the complexity of the error message, and it's making it difficult to focus on a specific line. The theme that's still present is the fear of being stuck and not knowing where to start. My goal is to help you develop a way to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.

Therapist Answer:
I'll guide you through it. Look for the line that says "File '...at line 123'. See if you can find that line. As you read it, I'll be here with you, and we'll take it one word at a time.

Patient: I can't find that exact line — it's all a jumble of "Traceback" and "File" and numbers and my eyes just keep skipping around. My chest's tight and I feel kind of stupid about it, I don't know why it bothers me so much. Can you tell me exactly which line to click — like the first "File" entry or the one that says "line 123" — and stay with me while I try to read it? I guess I'll try to follow if you point to it.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling frustrated and humiliated by your inability to find the specific line, and it's making it difficult to feel confident in your ability to navigate the situation. The theme that's still present is the fear of being perceived as incompetent. My goal is to help you develop a way to reframe your experience and focus on the present moment.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you. Let me guide you. Point to the line that says "Traceback" and I'll help you follow it. See if we can find a specific line that starts with "File" and contains the number "123". Take a deep breath in and out, and as you point to the line, I'll be here with you.

Patient: Okay — I see "Traceback" and I'm pointing at the first "File" line, but there are several and my hands are shaking. I don't know, I feel stupid and my eyes keep skipping; could you tell me exactly which "File" line to click — like the first one or the one with a .py in the path? I guess I'll try to click it if you say so, but can you read the line out loud slowly while I focus?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're feeling extremely frustrated and humiliated by your inability to focus, and it's making it difficult to trust your own abilities. The theme that's still present is the fear of feeling like a failure and the tendency to catastrophize. My goal is to help you develop a way to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps and cultivate a sense of compassion for yourself.

Therapist Answer:
I'll guide you through this. The first "File" line that appears is the one with the path ".data". I want you to click on that line, slowly and deliberately. As you click it, I'll read it out loud for you: "File 'data.csv' at line 123". Take a deep breath in and out, and let's take it one step at a time.

Patient: Okay — I clicked it. It shows "File 'data.csv' at line 123" and then a traceback I can't make sense of; I don't know what those lines mean and I'm feeling stupid and shaky. Can you read the relevant line slowly and tell me, step by step, what to click or copy next? I guess I can try to follow if you walk me through it.
