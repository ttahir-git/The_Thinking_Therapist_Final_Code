Patient: I've been feeling on edge lately — I'm middle-aged, out of work, and the house feels really quiet since the kids moved out. I get these bursts of anger and frustration, especially in interactions that remind me of the empty nest, and I don't handle them well. I don't know, talking about it makes me uncomfortable, I guess I'm worried you'll think it's silly.

Therapist: That takes courage to admit you're feeling uncomfortable with discussing this. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious or uneasy when you think about these emotions? Is it the fear of judgment, or something else?

Patient: I think it's a mix — I worry people will think I'm weak or overreacting, and I'm embarrassed about how lost I feel without the kids. I guess I'm also afraid of losing control and saying things I'll regret. I don't know, talking about it just makes me clam up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying around a lot of weight with these feelings. I want to gently challenge the idea that you're weak for feeling this way. Can you imagine what might happen if, instead of suppressing these emotions, you were to acknowledge and validate them in a safe space – like right here, in this conversation? Would that be a different experience for you?

Patient: I don't know, maybe it would feel different — maybe lighter. I guess acknowledging it here could help, but I'm really worried about being judged or about losing control and saying things I regret. Can we take it slow and start with smaller stuff? I don't know, I'm just kind of overwhelmed.

Therapist: Let's take a small step back. Can you notice what's happening in your body right now, physically, when you think about talking about these emotions? Is there any tension, or is it more of a mental feeling?

Patient: My chest gets tight and my shoulders tense up, and my jaw sort of clenches. My head goes foggy and I start reaching for something else to think about — I don't know, it's like the easiest escape. I guess I can try to stay with it, but can we go slower?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed. Can you imagine what would be valuable to you in this moment, something that would help you feel more grounded or at ease? Is there something, even small, that you've always wanted to talk about or explore, but haven't had the chance?

Patient: I don't know... maybe something small, like a few deep breaths or a cup of tea, would help me feel less jumpy. I guess I'd like to talk a bit about why I snap at the kids when they ask for help or when they leave, but even saying that makes me clam up. Can we really take it slow?

Therapist: Let's start with a simple, low-stakes exercise: Can you take one deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly through your mouth, allowing any tension to release? As you breathe, notice what happens in your body – is your chest relaxing, or do you feel a slight sense of calm?

Patient: Okay — I did it. My chest feels a tiny bit looser and my shoulders dropped a little, but my jaw's still clenching and my head's foggy. I don't know, I guess it helped a bit, but can we do a few more like that? I'm feeling kind of shaky.

Therapist: That's great that you're noticing some small shifts in your body. Let's build on that. As you continue to breathe deeply, imagine that with each exhalation, you're creating space for calmness and clarity to emerge. What would be really important to you in life right now, something that would feel like a success or a source of joy, and how might this calmness help you approach that?

Patient: I guess what's most important right now is feeling useful again — having some routine or purpose, maybe work or a project that doesn't make me feel invisible, and not snapping at the kids so we can actually stay close. If I could stay calmer, I think I'd be able to pause before reacting, think clearer, and choose to reach out instead of shutting down. I don't know, picturing it feels a bit scary — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Let's slow down further. Can you imagine a scenario where you're engaged in an activity that feels purposeful and useful, perhaps something like gardening or working on a hobby. As you're doing this, what sensations do you notice in your body? Are there any areas of tension or relaxation?

Patient: I don't know... when I picture doing something like gardening my shoulders loosen a bit and my breathing gets a little easier, my hands don't feel so tight. My jaw's still clenched though and my head keeps filling with 'what if it doesn't help' thoughts. I guess it feels a bit quieter, but I'm getting nervous — can we take it even slower?

Therapist: Let's take it even slower. Instead of focusing on specific outcomes or fears, can you simply notice the sensation of your body relaxing in the garden, as if you were already there? Just observe the sensation of your shoulders, hands, and breath without judgment, allowing yourself to be present with what is.

Patient: Okay... my shoulders do feel a bit softer, my hands a little warmer, and my breathing's steadier. My jaw's still tight and this stupid "what if it doesn't help" thought keeps butting in. I don't know, it feels kind of possible but I'm nervous — can we stay here a bit longer or maybe try another really slow breath together?

Therapist: Let's stay here together for another moment. I'm going to say something, and I want you to repeat it back to me in your own words. Can you say, "I am holding a thought that says 'what if it doesn't help,' and I'm going to acknowledge that it's just a thought, not a reflection of reality"?

Patient: I don't know... I'm holding this thought that says, "what if it doesn't help," and I'm going to try to notice it as just a thought, not a fact about me. I guess I keep feeling ashamed and frustrated that I even have that doubt, but I'll try to let it be without letting it run the show.

Therapist: Notice that you've acknowledged your thought and are choosing to let it be. Can you think of one value that feels important to you, perhaps related to feeling useful or capable, and how that value is connected to your desire to make a positive impact on your children?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the value is being useful or dependable — feeling like I matter. That matters because I want my kids to know they can count on me, and I want to stop feeling invisible or like I'm just taking up space. I feel ashamed and frustrated I keep getting angry instead of showing that, and my mind's all over the place right now — can we take it slower?

Therapist: Let's take it slower. What would it mean to you, in concrete terms, to feel like you're being useful and dependable to your children? Is it showing up consistently for them, helping with homework, or having meaningful conversations?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would be the small, steady things — answering when they call, showing up when they need help, doing little practical stuff, or just being able to sit and listen without snapping. I'm ashamed and frustrated that even those simple things feel hard right now, and my head's all fuzzy so it already feels like too much.

Therapist: Those small, steady things sound really important to you. Can you imagine taking one small step this week, just one thing, to show up for your children in a small but meaningful way? Maybe it could be something as simple as cooking them a favorite meal or helping with a chore they've been putting off.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try one small thing — maybe cook their favorite meal this weekend or just call and actually listen for ten minutes. I'm ashamed I'm even saying that; I'm worried I'll snap or go blank, and my head's all foggy so it already feels like too much. Can we walk through it step by step? I feel kind of shaky.

Therapist: Let's break it down further. Can we start with something even smaller, like taking a single deep breath with the intention of calling your child and saying "I'm here for you"? Just that one sentence, without any expectations or outcomes. Can you repeat that sentence to me, and let's take it from there?

Patient: "I'm here for you." I don't know, saying that makes me feel ashamed and kind of shaky, like I'll freeze or mess it up. I guess I can try — can we take one more slow breath before I call?

Therapist: One more deep breath, just for me, to seal this moment in. When you're ready, take that breath, and then go ahead and call your child. Remember, it's just a simple phrase, and there's no expectation of how they'll respond. You're taking care of yourself by taking this step.

Patient: Okay — I took the breath. I started to dial but my hand shook and I couldn't press call; I don't know, I'm ashamed and angry at myself, like that old failure keeps showing up and freezing me. I guess I can try again, but can we do one more slow breath together and you stay with me?

Therapist: It's okay to feel that way, and it's okay to feel stuck. You're taking a huge step by facing your fears and trying again. Let's take one more deep breath together, and I'll stay with you. I'm here, and I'm not judging you. Take the breath in... and out... and when you're ready, I'll walk with you through the next step.

Patient: Okay... I took the breath. I tried to dial but my hand shook and I froze — that shame keeps showing up and I get angry at myself for it. I don't know if I can call yet; I guess we can do one more really slow breath together and you stay with me while I try.

Therapist: It's okay to feel stuck, and it's okay to feel angry with yourself. But I want you to know that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Take this breath... and as you exhale, I want you to repeat after me: "I am doing the best I can, and that is enough." Can you do that with me?

Patient: "I am doing the best I can, and that is enough." I don't know if I really believe that — I feel ashamed and angry at myself, like that same thing keeps popping up and freezing me. I guess... can we do one more slow breath together? Stay with me while I try.

Therapist: Let's take this breath together... I want you to know that I'm here, and I believe in you. Can you look at your hand, and I want you to offer it a gentle, kind gesture, like a smile or a wave of kindness? As you do that, I want you to repeat after me: "May I be kind to myself, exactly as I am, in this moment."

Patient: I looked at my hand and tried a small, awkward smile. "May I be kind to myself, exactly as I am, in this moment." I don't know if I really believe it — I feel ashamed and tense and my mind keeps flitting away, but I'll try to hold on to it for now.

Therapist: It's okay if your mind wanders, and it's okay if it feels awkward. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to acknowledge. Can you notice what's happening in your body right now, without judgment? Where do you feel tension or relaxation?

Patient: I don't know... my chest's tight and my shoulders are up near my ears, my jaw's clenched and my hands feel a bit shaky. There's this shamey, frustrated feeling that washes over me and makes my head go foggy so my attention keeps jumping away. I guess I'm trying to notice, but it's hard to stay with it for long.

Therapist: Notice that the shamey, frustrated feeling is just a thought, and it's not a reflection of your worth or identity. Can you see it as a thought, like a cloud passing across the sky, rather than a permanent fixture in your life? Let's take a moment to just observe that thought, without judgment, and see if we can gently let it go.

Patient: I can kinda see it as a thought, like a cloud passing, but I don't know — I keep getting this wave of shame and frustration that pins me, and I guess that old failing feeling sneaks in and freezes me. My head's foggy and I'm really worn out, so it's hard to let it go; can we do one more very slow breath together and stay with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take one more very slow breath together... I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. Can you imagine a warm, safe space around you, like a cozy blanket or a peaceful room, where you can feel grounded and supported?

Patient: I can try — I see a small, warm room with soft light and a blanket over my knees. My shoulders drop a little and my breathing eases, but my jaw's still clenched and that stupid shame keeps creeping in, making me feel dumb for not being able to settle. I don't know if this helps, but I guess it feels a bit safer. Can we stay here a little longer and do one more slow breath together?

Therapist: That warm room with soft light and a blanket sounds like a wonderful sanctuary. Can you imagine yourself stepping into that space right now, and as you breathe in, say to yourself: "I am doing the best I can, and that is enough. I am kind to myself, and I am worthy of care and compassion."

Patient: Okay... I stepped into the room and breathed in: "I am doing the best I can, and that is enough. I am kind to myself, and I am worthy of care and compassion." I don't know if I really believe it — I feel ashamed, my jaw's tight, my hands are shaky, and my mind's all over the place. Can we stay here a bit longer and do one more slow breath together? I'm kind of nervous.

Therapist: You've taken a huge step by stepping into that warm room and repeating those words. I want you to know that I'm here with you, and I believe in you. You're not alone in this journey. Take one more deep breath with me, and as you exhale, I want you to say: "I am exactly where I need to be, and I am doing the best I can."

Patient: I don't know... I breathed in and out and said, "I am exactly where I need to be, and I am doing the best I can." I don't really believe it — shame keeps creeping in, my jaw's tight, my hands are shaking, and my mind's all over the place. Can we stay here a bit longer and do one more slow breath together?

Therapist: You've done the best you can, and that's something to be proud of. I want you to know that it's okay to feel the shame and doubt – it's a natural part of the process. Take one last deep breath with me, and when you're ready, we'll gently bring this session to a close. Remember, we can come back to this space whenever you need it, and we'll continue to work together to build your confidence and self-compassion.

Patient: I don't know... I can't do "one last" — I'm not ready to end. I'm still shaky and that old failure keeps freezing me and I'm ashamed and frustrated, and it feels like too much to just stop now. Can we stay here a bit longer? Maybe one more really slow breath together, and then just pick one tiny, concrete next step I can try this week — something I won't mess up.

Therapist: I completely understand, and it's okay to take more time. We can stay here as long as you need. Let's take one more really slow breath together, and when you're ready, let's identify one tiny, concrete next step you can take this week. Something small, like making a cup of tea, or taking a short walk, or simply sitting in a quiet space for 5 minutes. What would that tiny step be for you?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the tiniest thing I can try this week is to make a cup of tea and sit in that warm room for five minutes, doing three really slow breaths and just noticing my jaw and shoulders. I'm ashamed it feels so small and like I should be able to do more, but I think I can try that—can you stay with me while I picture doing it and help me plan when I'll do it?

Therapist: I'll stay with you every step of the way. Let's picture yourself making that cup of tea and sitting in the warm room, taking three slow breaths, and noticing your jaw and shoulders. Imagine how it feels to be doing something small but meaningful for yourself. What day and time would you like to commit to trying this this week? Would you like to schedule it for first thing in the morning, or later in the evening?

Patient: I don't know... mornings feel too hard, I get flustered, so maybe later in the day — like Saturday around 4pm when it's quieter. I guess I'm ashamed it seems so small and I'm nervous I'll chicken out, but I'll try to commit to that. Can you stay with me while I picture the steps — boil the water, choose a cup, sit with the blanket — and help me make it concrete so I won't mess it up?
