Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of tearing myself down over every mistake, especially at work — I can't seem to let anything go. I did poorly in school and even though I managed to build a solid career as a data scientist, that old voice keeps calling me a failure, and with the job instability lately it's gotten worse. I don't know, it's just... hard to talk about.

Therapist: Can you describe what it's like to hear that old voice in your head, telling you that you're a failure? Where does it show up for you in your body or emotions when you hear it?

Patient: It feels like a knot in my chest and my stomach drops — my hands go cold and I get this buzzing in my head like I should be doing something right now. Emotionally it's shame and this rush to prove myself, so I either freeze or start over-checking things at work until I'm exhausted. I don't know, I guess I mostly try to keep busy so I don't have to sit with it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to avoid the discomfort of sitting with that knot in your chest. Can you think of a moment where you felt proud of yourself, doing something that had nothing to do with proving yourself to others, but rather something that felt meaningful to you? What would it be like to approach this shame and self-criticism with kindness and curiosity, rather than trying to avoid or prove yourself?

Patient: I guess one time I taught a free weekend coding class at the community center and a kid came up afterwards really proud of something they built — that felt like I’d done something that mattered just because, not to prove anything. If I tried to meet that shame with kindness, I don't know, maybe it'd be like noticing the knot and asking it what's scared instead of immediately trying to fix it. I'm struggling to actually sit with that though, it gets uncomfortable fast and I start wanting to move on.

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment. Notice the sensation of shame in your body right now, without trying to do anything about it. As you observe it, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the word "failure" or "not being good enough?" What's the first thought that shows up?

Patient: When I focus on that knot, the first thought is like, "You're a screw-up — they'll find out you never really had it together," like that old teacher's voice. I guess it makes me want to jump into panic mode and start triple-checking everything so I don't get exposed. I don't know, it's loud and nagging and I want to look away from it.

Therapist: Can you imagine, just for a moment, that you're not defined by this voice or the fear of being exposed? What would be a small, personal value that would be more important to you than trying to control every outcome in your work?

Patient: I guess a small value would be being helpful — like actually showing up for people without needing it to prove I'm competent. Teaching that class felt like that: connection and making something useful, not about scores or impressing anyone. I don't know, it's just hard to keep that in mind when my brain's yelling I have to control everything.

Therapist: It sounds like you value being helpful, and you've experienced that in the past. What's one small action you could take tomorrow, right here in this moment, that would help someone without needing to prove your competence? For example, would you be willing to ask a colleague for help with a task, or maybe take a moment to offer a kind comment to someone who's struggling?

Patient: I could ask a colleague to pair on a tricky section of a model tomorrow — just a 15-minute check-in to get a second set of eyes. I don't know, it feels awkward to admit I need help, but I guess if I frame it as collaboration it won't feel like exposing myself. It still makes my chest tight, though, and I want to change the subject when it gets close.

Therapist: Let's try a gentle defusion exercise to help you connect with your physical sensations in a different way. When you feel the tightness in your chest, notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin. See if you can observe these sensations without trying to change them or label them as "helplessness." What happens when you're able to do this for just a few breaths?

Patient: A few breaths like that sometimes makes the knot loosen a tiny bit and my thoughts calm down for a second, like there's a little space. But it doesn't last — my brain immediately starts listing what I need to fix and I get this urge to move or do something. I don't know, I guess sitting with it feels really uncomfortable and I want to change the subject.

Therapist: Let's try a small, mindful behavioral step that you can take tomorrow when you feel the urge to act quickly. Instead of jumping into fixing the problem, would you be willing to take a few deep breaths and pause for just 30 seconds before taking action? Notice what happens in your body and mind during that pause.

Patient: I can try that. I guess I'll set a little 30-second timer on my phone or count five deep breaths before I act — framing it like an experiment helps me stick to it. I don't know, it still feels weird and my chest tightens at the thought of pausing, and I'm worried I'll just end up checking everything anyway. What should I do if the urge to jump in is overwhelming after the pause?

Therapist: What would you say to a friend who is struggling with a similar situation, and feeling overwhelmed by their own uncertainty? How would you respond with kindness and understanding? Now, can you offer the same kindness to yourself?

Patient: I'd tell a friend, "You're not a screw-up — look at what you've built and the ways you show up; one mistake doesn't erase that. Small steps matter, and asking for help doesn't make you less competent, it makes you practical." 

I guess I'd try to say that to myself, too, but I don't know — it feels hollow when I say it and I get this urge to change the subject or do something instead. Can we talk about ways to make those words actually feel true for me, or... I don't know, how to stop feeling fake when I say them?

Therapist: Let's explore this idea further. When you say those words to yourself, what's the physical sensation in your body? What's the tone of your inner voice? Can you imagine that you're speaking to a dear friend, and that the words are coming from a place of kindness and understanding?

Patient: When I try to say those kind things to myself, my chest tightens and my throat goes dry like I’m swallowing something — my hands clench and I get hot in the face. The inner voice is sharp and clipped, like that teacher who never had a kind word, urgent and a little mocking; when I try the kinder tone it comes out thin and weak and my brain jumps in to argue. I can imagine the warm, slower voice I'd use with a friend — I see it, but it doesn't land for me, I guess, and I don't know how to make it feel real.

Therapist: Can you imagine that the kinder, warmer voice is not just a mental construct, but a physical presence in your body? Where would you imagine that voice to be located in your body? Would it be in your heart, in your lungs, or somewhere else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is picturing it in my body supposed to help? If I try anyway, I guess that kinder voice would be in my chest, right where the knot is, but softer and warmer, like a small steady pressure near my heart. It feels weird to imagine it and I don't know if it really changes anything; I keep wanting to move on when it gets too close.

Therapist: Let's try a gentle, experiential exercise to help you connect with that sensation of a kinder voice in your chest. I'd like you to bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body, and as you breathe in, imagine that you're inhaling the warmth and kindness that's already present in your chest. As you breathe out, imagine that you're exhaling any tension or resistance. Can you do that for just a few breaths, noticing how it feels to hold the warmth and kindness in your body?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to help? I tried a few breaths like you said and there was a tiny looseness in the knot, like a faint warmth in my chest, but then my head started listing everything I have to fix and I wanted to get up and do something. I don't know, I guess it feels weird and a bit fake, and I keep wanting to change the subject when it gets too close. What should I do when that urge to move hits—keep breathing, or is there something more practical I can do then?

Therapist: When you feel the urge to move or change the subject, can you take a moment to simply observe that urge without acting on it? Instead, bring your attention back to your breath or the physical sensation in your body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, or the sensation of your hands or feet. When you're ready, take a few more deep breaths, and if the urge to move still arises, try to say to yourself: "I'm willing to stay with this feeling, even if it's uncomfortable."

Patient: I'm trying to do it, but my chest's racing and my hands feel tingly — I take a breath, notice my feet on the floor, say to myself "I'm willing to stay with this feeling," and it sort of... lands for a second, then everything starts pinging and I want to get up. I don't know, I guess the phrase feels thin, like a checkbox rather than anything real, and I keep getting distracted by all the things I should be fixing at work. What do I actually do if the urge to move is overwhelming after those breaths?

Therapist: Let's explore this further. When you feel the urge to move or get up, instead of trying to stop it or distract yourself, can you ask yourself: "What's the value that's driving my desire to leave this spot right now? Is it getting work done, or is it something else?" What is it that's more important to you in this moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I guess the urge to leave is partly about wanting control and partly about not wanting to feel exposed, like if I sit with it I'll somehow prove I'm a fraud. On the surface I tell myself it's about getting work done or being practical, but underneath it's about avoiding shame and protecting my sense of competence. My chest's tight and my hands are tingly right now and I keep listing things I "should" fix; I don't know what to do if I can't manage to stay even a minute without bailing.

Therapist: Can you try to address the voice that says you're a "fraud" directly? What would you say to that voice, as if it were a dear friend? Would you offer it kindness, understanding, and compassion?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I talked to that voice I'd say, "I hear you — you're terrified of being found out, but you're not a fraud. Look at the work you've done, the people you've helped, you kept going when it mattered." 

But when I say that my chest tightens and the words feel hollow, like they're sliding off something hard, and I get this flush of shame and want to change the subject. I could try saying it out loud more, but I don't know how to make it actually land.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the words themselves, can you try to connect with the physical sensation of your body as you say the words? As you speak, notice the sensation of your words in your mouth, the sensation of your breath moving in and out, and the sensation of your body relaxing or tensing up. Pay attention to the physical sensations in your chest, the sensation of your heart rate, and the sensations in your hands and feet. Can you allow yourself to feel these sensations fully, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? When I try to let those sensations in my chest clamps down, my heart races, my hands go tingly, and this hot shame comes over me like... like something from the past is right there and I can't breathe. It makes me want to jump up and start fixing things or change the subject; I don't know how to stay with it without feeling like I'm falling apart. What do I actually do in the moment if it gets that overwhelming—keep breathing, or is there some practical step to stop me from bailing?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, take a moment to acknowledge that you're experiencing a lot of discomfort. Say to yourself: "I'm feeling really uncomfortable right now, and that's okay. I'm going to take care of myself and find a way to calm down." Then, without trying to change the sensation or push it away, simply acknowledge it: "I'm feeling this sensation in my chest, and it's overwhelming me. I'm going to take a few deep breaths and find a way to calm down." Notice how your body responds to this simple acknowledgment.

Patient: I'm trying that now — when I say, "I'm feeling really uncomfortable," there's a tiny drop in panic but then shame rushes back and my chest clamps down and my hands go tingly. I don't know, it helps for a beat, but my brain starts listing everything I should be doing and I feel like I have to get up. I'm not sure I follow how saying it is supposed to be enough — what do I actually do if that surge of wanting to bail doesn't go away? I keep wanting to change the subject because it feels like I'm about to fall apart.

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on saying the words or calming down, let's try taking a small, tangible action. Would you be willing to get up and do one thing that feels safe and manageable, like taking a glass of water or stretching your arms overhead? This can help you ground yourself in the present moment and reduce the feeling of overwhelm.

Patient: I can try that — I guess I'll get up and grab a glass of water and stretch my arms overhead for a bit. I'm not sure how this is supposed to help though; my chest's racing and I feel this hot flush of shame like that old failure memory and I'm already annoyed at myself for needing to do something. I'll do it, but I don't know if it'll settle anything — what if I just use it to bail out instead of actually staying with this?

Therapist: Let's try to explore this further. As you're getting up and grabbing the glass of water, can you pause for just a moment and ask yourself: "What's the most important thing for me to do right now, rather than trying to fix everything or get away from my feelings?" What would you prioritize?

Patient: I guess the most important thing right now is to actually ground myself — get the water, take a couple slow breaths, feel my feet on the floor, and try to sit back down instead of using it as an excuse to run. I don't know, maybe promise myself just one minute of sitting with the feeling before I do anything else; my chest's tight and I keep wanting to bail, so I'm worried I'll just grab the water and leave. What if I can't make it through that one minute — what should I do then?

Therapist: Let's try to reframe the idea of commitment to be more about flexibility and adaptability. Instead of promising yourself one minute, what if you simply say to yourself: "I'll take it one breath at a time"? Can you try to focus on the present moment, just this one breath, without worrying about the outcome or the next breath?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — one breath. It steadies me for a second; my chest loosens a bit and I can feel my feet on the floor. Then my brain starts listing everything I should be fixing and the urge to get up comes back. I don't know, I can take another breath, but what if it just gives me more time to panic?

Therapist: Let's try to explore this further. Instead of focusing on the outcome or trying to fix the thoughts and emotions, what if you simply asked yourself: "What is happening in this moment, exactly? What are the sensations in my body, the thoughts that are passing through my mind, and the emotions that are rising up?" Can you try to observe these things without judgment or trying to change them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I'm trying, but it's fuzzy and my head's pinging with a million things. My chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my hands tingle and my face heats up; thoughts loop like "fix it, don't get found out," and the shame feels huge and hot. I don't know, I guess I want to stand up and do something instead of sitting with it — how do I actually stay when it feels like I'm about to fall apart?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to stay with the intense emotions, what if we try to acknowledge them with a sense of curiosity and interest? Can you try to say to yourself: "This feeling of shame and anxiety is like a fire in my body. It's hot, intense, and overwhelming. But what if I just acknowledged it, without trying to fight it or escape from it? What would happen if I simply allowed it to be there, without judgment or resistance?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — but I'll try. If I say it like that, the shame really is like a hot fire in my chest, my breath gets shallow, my hands tingle, and my head starts yelling "fix it, don't get found out." I try to be curious about it and it just feels thin and kind of fake, and I immediately want to get up or change the subject. I don't know — what do I actually do in the moment if that urge to bail is overwhelming?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to stay with the emotions or be curious, what if we try to bring in a sense of safety and care? Can you try to say to yourself: "I'm not trying to avoid this feeling, I'm just trying to be kind to myself right now. I'm not a bad person, I'm just feeling really scared and overwhelmed. I'm going to take care of myself, and that means taking a break if I need to." 

(Note: This response is more direct and gentle, and acknowledges the patient's need to take a break and prioritize their own needs. It also acknowledges that the patient is not a bad person and that they are not alone in their emotions.)

Patient: Okay — I'll try saying it: "I'm not trying to avoid this feeling, I'm just trying to be kind to myself right now. I'm not a bad person, I'm just feeling really scared and overwhelmed. I'm going to take care of myself, and that means taking a break if I need to." 

Saying that gives a tiny drop in panic, then shame floods back and my chest clamps and my hands tingle. I guess I'm worried I'll just use a "break" to bail—how do I know a break is actually self-care and not me running away? I don't know, can we make a concrete rule for what a safe break looks like?

Therapist: Let's try to explore this further. Can you think of a specific activity that you enjoy doing when you're feeling overwhelmed, something that feels nourishing and relaxing to you? It could be taking a walk, reading a book, or doing a creative activity. What is it, and what do you need to do to make sure you're doing that activity in a way that feels safe and intentional, rather than just as a way to escape?

Patient: I guess when I'm overwhelmed I usually go for a brisk walk — just around the block or to the little park nearby — or I make a strong cup of tea and pace while listening to something non-worky. To make it intentional I could set a 15-minute timer, put my phone on Do Not Disturb except for calls from family, and promise myself to sit down for one minute and notice how I feel before I touch work again. I don't know, even saying that feels a bit like an excuse to bail, so maybe also having a short return plan — like doing one tiny work task or texting a friend after the break — would keep it from turning into avoidance. Is that... reasonable, or am I just making rules to soothe myself?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to create a system that works for you, and that's great. The idea of having a return plan, such as doing one tiny work task or texting a friend, can help you feel more grounded and connected to your work afterwards. Instead of thinking of it as an excuse to bail, try to see it as a way to validate your need for self-care and make a conscious choice to prioritize your own needs. Can you say to yourself: "I'm taking this break because I need to take care of myself, and I'm committed to coming back to my work with a fresh perspective and a sense of clarity?"

Patient: "I'm taking this break because I need to take care of myself, and I'm committed to coming back to my work with a fresh perspective and a sense of clarity." Saying that gives a tiny bit of space, but then my chest tightens and I start worrying I'm just bailing. I don't know — can we make a concrete rule together so a break feels intentional (like 15 minutes, DND except family, then one tiny return task) and not just an excuse to run? I guess I need help deciding what that return task should be so I don't just avoid things.
