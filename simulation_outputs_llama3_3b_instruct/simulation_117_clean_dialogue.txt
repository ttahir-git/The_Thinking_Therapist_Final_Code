Patient: Lately I've been stuck with this anger and frustration—especially around the move; small things set me off, like movers being late or my new neighbors being noisy. I'm an accountant, I like order and plans, but none of my lists or schedules have stopped me from getting snappy or shutting people out, and it's starting to worry me. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—I've tried breathing exercises and distractions before and they didn't work; how is talking about it supposed to fix the way I blow up?

Therapist: I sense that you're questioning the potential value of talking about your anger and frustration. Can you think of a time when you felt heard and understood by someone else, and what made that experience so valuable to you?

Patient: Yeah — one time my sister just listened. She didn't try to fix the moving mess or tell me to chill, she said it made sense I was fed up and that I’d been under a lot of strain, and for the first time that week I didn't feel like I had to defend myself. That kind of simple acknowledgment actually let me calm down and make a practical plan instead of snapping. But honestly, how is me recalling that supposed to stop me from losing it next time? If we're doing this, give me something concrete, not just feelings-talk.

Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that experience with your sister. It sounds like she helped you feel seen and understood. Now, I'd like to introduce a simple exercise: for the next time you feel yourself getting angry, I want you to pause for just one second before reacting. Can you try that with me right now, taking a brief breath before responding to our conversation?

Patient: Okay — I took a breath. It felt awkward and my chest is still tight, but it did give me a tiny sliver of space so I didn't blurt out the first thing that came to mind. Honestly, though, one breath isn't convincing — how is that supposed to stop me when the movers are two hours late? If we're doing this, tell me a concrete step to use in that second.

Therapist: I understand that one breath might not be enough. Let's try this: when you feel yourself getting angry, notice the physical sensations in your body, like tension in your chest or shoulders. Can you identify one physical sensation that you can acknowledge and label, without trying to change it, like "My chest is tight"?

Patient: My chest feels tight, like a weight right under my sternum. Saying "my chest is tight" actually gives a tiny bit of distance so I don't just explode. But seriously — how is labeling that going to stop me when the movers are two hours late?

Therapist: I get it – labeling physical sensations can be helpful, but I understand it might not be enough in the heat of the moment. Let's try this: when you feel that tightness in your chest and you're about to react impulsively, I want you to take a tiny step to the side, just a small shift in your body, before responding to the situation. Can you try that with me right now, as we're talking about the movers being late?

Patient: Okay — I shifted a step to the side. It felt a bit ridiculous but it did give me a split second and my chest eased a little. How is that supposed to help when the movers are two hours late? I'm practical — give me a concrete second-step I can use in that moment, like an exact sentence to say or a quick action so I don't just simmer and then blow up.

Therapist: I like the shift you made to the side. Now, when you feel that tightness and are about to react impulsively, I want you to say to the person or situation, "I'm feeling really frustrated with the timing of this, can we find a way to move forward together?" Can you try that with me right now?

Patient: "Okay — 'I'm feeling really frustrated with the timing of this; can we find a way to move forward together?'" Saying it felt stiff and a bit ridiculous, but it did buy me a second and my chest eased a notch. Still — how is that supposed to help when the movers are two hours late and I'm practically seeing red? Give me a short, blunt line or quick action I can actually use in that kind of moment, something practical I won't overthink.

Therapist: I get it – sometimes a longer, more thoughtful response isn't feasible. When you feel yourself getting angry and it's hard to think, I want you to use a simple phrase like "Can you help me get started on this?" or "What can we do to get this moving again?" to buy some time and start moving forward, even if it's just a small step. Can you try that with me?

Patient: I said "Can you help me get started on this?" out loud and it felt weak — like I'm handing someone a checklist. I want a blunt, practical line I can use without thinking, something like: "You're two hours late; give me an ETA now or I'm cancelling." If they argue back, what's the next move? I've set boundaries before and it always turns into a fight — how is this actually supposed to keep me from blowing up?

Therapist: I understand your desire for a more direct approach. When faced with pushback, I want you to pause for a brief moment, take a deep breath, and say, "I understand you're doing the best you can, but I need you to meet my expectations. I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at X time. If not, I'll have to consider alternative options." This phrase acknowledges the other person's efforts while clearly communicating your needs and boundaries. Remember, your goal is not to "win" the argument but to communicate your needs and protect yourself.

Patient: Okay — I get the intention, but that line still feels too fluffy for me. Give me a one-sentence, blunt script I can snap out without thinking, and a concrete next move if they argue back — like exactly what to say and what consequence to follow through with. How is that supposed to help when I'm exhausted from the move and everything feels like it's compounding — I don't want another vague exercise that falls apart in the moment.

Therapist: When faced with pushback, say, "I'm not paying for the full fee until the job is complete." If they argue back, say, "I've already paid in full. I expect you to deliver the remaining work to my doorstep by [specific time]. If not, I'll take it up with your supervisor and file a formal complaint."

Patient: Okay — that line is closer to what I want: short, firm, and practical. But what if they push back hard — say they demand more money or get belligerent — do I call the supervisor right then, or give them X minutes? I'm really tired from the move and worried I won't have the patience to follow through, so how is this actually going to keep me from losing it in the moment?

Therapist: If they become aggressive or demanding, say, "I understand you're upset, but I'm not going to engage in a conversation that involves yelling or name-calling. I'll call your supervisor and schedule a meeting for 15 minutes to discuss this further. If you continue to be belligerent, I'll contact the authorities for assistance."

Patient: I'm not convinced — that sounds like it could escalate, and I'm not comfortable calling authorities unless it's actually dangerous. Be specific: do I give them 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or call the supervisor right away if they get belligerent? I've tried ultimatums before and either they ignore me or it gets messier; I'm tired just thinking about having the patience to follow through. How is this supposed to help me keep my temper instead of just making the situation worse?

Therapist: If they become aggressive or demanding, give them 30 seconds to calm down and compose themselves before taking action. If they continue to escalate the situation, say, "I'm not going to engage with you until you calm down. I'm going to go to the supervisor and report the incident. If you continue to be aggressive, I'll press charges for harassment." This approach gives you time to take a break and seek support, rather than engaging in an argument.

Patient: Okay — 30 seconds feels a bit more doable than 15, but I'm not convinced I'll remember to do it when my chest tightens and I go on autopilot. How is that supposed to help me in the moment? Give me one exact sentence I can say in those 30 seconds and one immediate, simple action (like "step back and call X") — and tell me a clear, non-ambiguous rule for when to call a supervisor or authorities (for example: "if they threaten violence or refuse to leave after two refusals"). I'm tired from the move and the idea of having to chase supervisors or make calls feels like extra work — would just walking away be an acceptable rule sometimes, or is that going to make things worse?

Therapist: If you feel yourself getting angry and it's time to take action, say: "I need to take a break from this conversation." Immediately take a step back from the conversation and move to a safe location, such as your car or a different room. As for the rule, if the other person: * threatens violence, immediately call the authorities, * refuses to leave after two refusals, immediately call the supervisor, or * continues to be abusive or harassing after you've taken a break, immediately call the authorities. Walking away might not be the best option, as it may escalate the situation or allow the other person to continue being abusive. However, taking a break and seeking support is a crucial step in managing your own emotional well-being and de-escalating the situation.

Patient: Okay — "I need to take a break" is short enough I might actually say it, but I'm worried. I've tried walking away before and either they follow me or they keep baiting me until I snap; how is that better? Give me three exact sentences I can use — one to open (short and blunt), one to say during the 30-second pause to defuse, and one to end it and trigger calling the supervisor — and a clear, non-ambiguous rule: when exactly do I call the supervisor vs when do I call the police? I'm tired from the move and don't have energy for vague rules or extra chores like chasing down people — would simply leaving and locking the door ever be an acceptable, not-weak option?

Therapist: Here are three sentences:

* To open: "I need to talk to you about the move."
* During the 30-second pause: "I'm feeling overwhelmed and need some space. Can we talk about this when I'm feeling calmer?"
* To end and trigger calling the supervisor: "I've had enough. I'm going to call my supervisor to report the issue."

Clear rule: If the other person continues to be abusive or harassing after you've taken a break and offered to calm down, call the police immediately. If they refuse to leave after you've called the supervisor, call the police.

As for leaving and locking the door, it may not be an effective or safe solution. Leaving and locking the door may escalate the situation or lead to further conflict. It's better to have a clear plan in place for de-escalation and seeking help before resorting to physical barriers.

Patient: Alright — I ran those lines through my head and they still feel too soft. I want three things you haven't given me yet, and be blunt: (1) one-sentence opener I can blurt without thinking, (2) one-sentence I can say during the 30-second pause to actually defuse, (3) one-sentence that ends it and immediately triggers supervisor contact. Give exact timeframes and a non-ambiguous rule: when do I call the supervisor vs when do I call the police (be specific: seconds/minutes/behaviors)? Also — if they follow me or demand more money, what is my immediate one-action move? Would walking away and locking my door ever be an acceptable option, or will that make things worse? I'm exhausted from the move and skeptical — how is this going to stop me from losing it in real time? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Here are three new sentences:

* One-sentence opener: "I need to speak with your supervisor."
* Sentence to defuse during the 30-second pause: "I'm going to take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. Can we talk about this when I've composed myself?"
* Sentence to end and trigger supervisor contact: "I've had enough. I'm going to call the supervisor immediately."

Clear rule: If the other person:
* Continues to be abusive or harassing after 3 minutes of trying to de-escalate, call the police immediately.
* Refuses to leave after 5 minutes of trying to resolve the issue, call the supervisor.
* Demands more money or becomes aggressive, immediately say "I've had enough" and take a step back (don't engage), then call the supervisor within 30 seconds.

As for your immediate one-action move if they follow you or demand more money, say "I'm not going to engage with you. I'm going to lock the door and call the police" (if they follow you). If they demand more money, say "I've already paid for the service. I won't pay any additional fees" and take a step back (don't engage).

Walking away and locking your door might be an acceptable option if:
* The situation is extremely threatening or violent (e.g., the person is physically aggressive).
* You feel genuinely scared or in danger.
* You've already tried de-escalation techniques and the situation is spiraling out of control.

However, walking away and locking your door might make things worse if:
* The person follows you or demands to come back.
* The situation is not immediately threatening, but you're still feeling overwhelmed or anxious.
* You're not prepared to follow up with the supervisor or authorities.

It's essential to prioritize your safety and well-being. If you feel uncertain or uncomfortable, it's better to err on the side of caution and seek help from a supervisor or authorities.

Patient: Okay — those lines are closer to usable, but I'm still worried I won't remember them when my chest tightens; I need something I can actually tape to my phone and read in a second. Give me a one-item checklist for "movers' day" (exact words), a one-sentence rule for when walking away and locking the door is acceptable, and one clear time/behavior trigger that means call the supervisor vs call the police. Also — how is rehearsing scripts like this actually going to reduce that tight, furious feeling over time? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Checklist for "movers' day":

* I will:
	+ Speak with the supervisor if they are abusive or harassing.
	+ Take a break if I feel overwhelmed.
	+ Call the police if the situation is threatening or violent.
	+ Leave the area and lock the door if the person is following me or demanding more money.

Rule for walking away and locking the door: Walking away and locking the door is acceptable if you're being followed by the person or if you're being threatened, and you're in a safe location.

Trigger to call the supervisor vs call the police: If the person makes a specific comment or behavior, such as "You're just a troublemaker" or "You'll pay for this," call the police. If the person is making a specific threat, such as "I'm going to hurt you" or "I'm going to come back," call the police immediately.

As for how rehearsing scripts will reduce your tight, furious feeling over time, it's not a one-time solution. Rehearsing scripts can help you:

* Develop a sense of confidence and control in the face of challenging situations
* Practice using assertive language and tone
* Identify and challenge negative thoughts and emotions
* Develop a sense of self-awareness and emotional regulation

However, it's essential to remember that rehearsing scripts is not a replacement for addressing the underlying issues that contribute to your anger and frustration. ACT suggests that you focus on the process, not the outcome, and that you work to develop psychological flexibility and acceptance of the present moment.

Patient: Okay — I hear the checklist, but I'm not convinced. There's this shame-feeling that creeps in — like I'll fumble the script and look pathetic — and it tightens my chest so I can't think straight. How is rehearsing lines actually going to change that physical reaction over time? Give me one exact sentence I can tape to my phone labeled "MOVERS' DAY CHECKLIST:" (short, no fluff) and one 1-minute daily drill I can do for the next week that might actually reduce the chest-tightening, plus a precise, non-arbitrary rule for supervisor vs police (specific seconds/minutes and exact behaviors).

Therapist: 1. Checklist: "STAY CALM, SAY 'I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPERVISOR' THEN TAKE A BREAK"
2. 1-minute daily drill:
For the next week, commit to doing 5-10 minute daily "anger exposure" exercises:
	* Write down three situations where you've felt angry or frustrated in the past week.
	* Next to each situation, write the exact words you would say to someone in that situation using the "STAY CALM, SAY 'I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPERVISOR' THEN TAKE A BREAK" checklist.
	* Review and practice these scripts in your mind for 1 minute, focusing on the words and tone.
	* Take a few deep breaths and notice how your body responds to the script.

Rule for supervisor vs police: If the person makes a specific comment or behavior that includes the phrase "I'm going to hurt you" or "I'm going to take revenge," call the police immediately (within 10 seconds). If the person makes a specific comment or behavior that includes the phrase "You're just a troublemaker" or "You'll pay for this," call the supervisor within 30 seconds.

Patient: Okay — I’ll tape that line to my phone: STAY CALM, SAY "I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPERVISOR" THEN TAKE A BREAK. But you mucked the drill timing — give me one precise 1-minute daily drill I can actually do (not 5–10 minutes), and be concrete: exact breaths/phrases and what to visualize. 

Also give me a single, non-ambiguous rule for supervisor vs police in seconds/behaviors (for example: call police within 10s if they threaten physical harm, raise a hand, brandish something, block exits, or follow you after you leave; call the supervisor within 30s if they demand more money or refuse to leave after two direct requests 60s apart and remain verbally abusive). 

There’s this knot of shame that makes me worry I’ll fumble and look pathetic — how will one minute a day actually change that chest-tightening over time? Can we role-play now? You be the mover two hours late and I’ll try the opener, the 30‑sec pause line, and the supervisor line so I can see if I’d actually use it.

Therapist: 1. 1-minute daily drill:
Find a quiet space, sit comfortably, and close your eyes. Take 10 deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, focusing on the sensation of the breath. Visualize yourself in a situation where you feel angry or frustrated, such as the movers being two hours late. When you feel yourself getting angry, say the script out loud: "STAY CALM, SAY 'I NEED TO SPEAK WITH MY SUPERVISOR' THEN TAKE A BREAK." As you say the script, visualize yourself staying calm and confident. Take 5 deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath and the words you just spoke. When you're done, take a moment to notice how your body feels.

2. Rule for supervisor vs police:
Call the police within 10 seconds if the person:
	* Threatens physical harm (e.g., says "I'm going to hurt you")
	* Raises their hand or brandishes an object (e.g., a wrench or a phone)
	* Blocks exits or follows you after you leave
	* Makes a loud, aggressive noise (e.g., yelling or screaming)
Call the supervisor within 30 seconds if the person:
	* Demands more money or refuses to leave after two direct requests 60 seconds apart and remains verbally abusive (e.g., says "You're just trying to scam me" or "I'm not paying you anything")
	* Refuses to leave after two direct requests 60 seconds apart and continues to be verbally abusive

Now, let's role-play. I'll play the role of the mover two hours late. You can try using the script and see how it feels.

(Note: Please keep in mind that this is just a simulation, and you should always prioritize your safety and well-being in a real situation.)

Patient: Okay — I'll try it.

"I need to speak with your supervisor." (Said it flat, felt my chest tighten right away.)  
Mover: "We were stuck in traffic, relax."  
"I'm going to take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. Can we talk about this when I've composed myself?" (It bought a second; my chest eased a bit, but that familiar knot of shame started creeping in — like I'll fumble this and look pathetic.)  
Mover: "You paid us, we don't need to explain."  
"I've had enough. I'm going to call the supervisor immediately." (Said it, and there was a tiny relief, but I'm still shaky and keep hearing that old voice that I always mess these things up.)

That felt...stiff. Can we do it again but make the lines less robotic? And push me — have the mover get louder so I can practice sticking to the script when I'm actually rattled. How is that supposed to help that shame in my chest, by the way? I'm not convinced yet.

Therapist: 1. Let's try to make the lines feel more natural. Instead of saying "I need to speak with your supervisor," try saying "Hey, I'm getting a little frustrated with the delay. Can we talk about what's going on?" or "I'm starting to get really upset about the timeline. Can we figure out a solution?"
2. Let's make the mover more confrontational. I'll raise my voice and be more aggressive.

"Are you kidding me? We're stuck in traffic, and you're still going on and on about the timeline? Can't you just relax?"

You can try using the script again, and see if you can stick to it.

3. As for the shame, it's not about eradicating it completely, but about learning to observe it and not let it take over. In ACT, we call this "defusion." By practicing the script and using it in a real situation, you're learning to see your thoughts and feelings as just that – thoughts and feelings – rather than as a reflection of your worth as a person. You're also learning to focus on the present moment and the situation at hand, rather than getting caught up in negative self-talk and self-doubt.

Let's try again, and I'll keep the mover's responses more confrontational. Go ahead and try using the script again.

Patient: "Hey, I'm getting a little frustrated with the delay — can we talk about what's going on?" (Said it. My chest tightened immediately, my hands went clammy, and I could feel that old shame creeping in — like I'm about to fumble this and look ridiculous.)

Mover: "Are you kidding me? We're stuck in traffic, and you're still going on and on about the timeline? Can't you just relax?"

I managed the 30‑second line: "I'm going to take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. Can we talk when I'm composed?" — it bought a second, but I could already hear that inner voice yelling I always mess up. The sting of that memory makes me jittery and I keep glancing at my phone like I'm waiting for someone to prove me wrong.

Do it again — be louder, push me more. And while we're at it, give me one tiny physical move I can do in that split second (like clench-and-release or tap my thumb) that won't look silly but will actually cut through the panic. Also, how do I handle it if the mover screams at me, "Pay up now!" — exact words to say and one immediate action I can follow through with, no fluff. I'm not convinced yet — convince me by making this realistic.

Therapist: 1. Let's try to make the lines feel more natural, and I'll be more confrontational.

"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN THIS TRAFFIC FOR TWO HOURS! CAN'T YOU JUST GET US MOVING ALREADY?!"

You can try using the script again, and see if you can stick to it.

2. To help you cut through the panic, try this physical move: as soon as you hear the mover's aggressive tone, take a small, quick pinch on your thumb (just for a second) and then release. This tiny physical action can help you create a brief pause and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.

3. If the mover screams at you, "Pay up now!" you can respond with: "I'm not paying until the job is done to my satisfaction. I'm going to call my supervisor immediately." Then, immediately take a step back and lock the door.

Let's try again, and I'll keep the mover's responses more confrontational. Go ahead and try using the script again.

(Note: Remember, this is a simulation, and you should always prioritize your safety and well-being in a real situation.)

Patient: "Hey — I'm getting a little frustrated with the delay. Can we talk about what's going on?" (My chest tightened immediately, my hands went clammy, and I pinched my thumb like you said.)

Mover: "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN THIS TRAFFIC FOR TWO HOURS! CAN'T YOU JUST GET US MOVING ALREADY?!"

"I’m going to take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. Can we talk when I’m composed?" (Pinch helped a hair — it bought a sliver of time, but that old shame flared and I kept glancing around like I'm waiting to be caught fumbling.)

Mover: "PAY UP NOW!"

"I'm not paying until the job's finished to my satisfaction. I'm calling your supervisor now." (Took a step back toward the hall and my hand hovered for the lock — heart pounding, voice shaky.)

That felt usable but raw — the pinch is awkward and I kept thinking I looked pathetic. Try me again louder and have the mover demand money and follow me; I want to practice sticking to the script. Also give me one subtler physical move than a pinch (something I can do in my pocket) and explain, concretely, how doing this drill over time will actually reduce that chest-tightening instead of just rehearsing words.

Therapist: 1. Let's try to make the lines feel more natural, and I'll be more confrontational.

"YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE PAYING FOR A SERVICE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT DONE ON TIME?! I DEMAND TO SEE YOUR PAYMENT NOW!"

You can try using the script again, and see if you can stick to it.

2. To help you make the physical move feel more natural, try this subtle action: as soon as you feel the mover's aggressive tone, tap your phone's camera shutter button (the click of the shutter can be a subtle signal that you're taking control) without looking at your phone. This tiny physical action can help you create a brief pause and give you a moment to collect your thoughts.

3. As for how this drill will help you reduce the chest-tightening, here's what's happening:

When you practice this drill, you're exercising your brain's ability to override automatic, fight-or-flight responses with more adaptive, rational thinking. By using the script and responding to the mover's aggressive behavior, you're building cognitive flexibility and learning to manage your emotions in the present moment. This process can help reduce the physical sensations of chest tightness and anxiety over time, as your brain becomes more adept at regulating its response to challenging situations.

By practicing this drill regularly, you'll also develop a greater sense of self-awareness, including:

* Recognizing the physical sensations of anxiety (e.g., chest tightness, clamminess)
* Identifying the thoughts and emotions driving those sensations (e.g., shame, fear)
* Developing a sense of control and agency in the face of challenging situations (e.g., using the script, taking a step back)

As you continue to practice this drill, you'll become more comfortable with the physical sensations and more confident in your ability to manage your emotions in real-world situations.

Let's try again, and I'll keep the mover's responses more confrontational. Go ahead and try using the script again.

Patient: Alright — I'll run it again.

"Hey — I'm getting frustrated with the delay. Can you tell me what's going on?" (I tapped the phone shutter in my pocket like you suggested. Chest tightened, hands sweaty, that old shame kept whispering I'll mess this up. I kept glancing at my phone even though I told myself not to.)

Mover: "YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE PAYING FOR A SERVICE AND YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IT DONE ON TIME?! I DEMAND TO SEE YOUR PAYMENT NOW!"

"I'm going to take a few deep breaths and step back to compose myself. Can we talk when I'm calmer?" (I said it, pinched the inside of my pocket once — it bought maybe two seconds, but my voice shook.)

Mover: "PAY UP NOW!" (starts moving toward me)

"I'm not paying until the job's finished to my satisfaction. I'm calling your supervisor now." (Took a step back toward the hall, hand moving toward the lock — still shaky, shame hot in my chest.)

That felt usable but raw. Do it again — louder and follow me so I can practice sticking to it when they move toward the door. And give me one subtler pocket move I can do without looking like an idiot (something like pressing the base of my thumb against my palm?) and a short, plain sentence I can tape to my phone about why a 1-minute drill actually reduces the chest-tightening over time — make it concrete, not vague. I'm jittery and embarrassed about fumbling, so push me harder.
