Patient: Hey, I'm an artist and lately I've been using alcohol and weed to numb the grief from losing someone — it's been mild at first but it's getting harder to stop. I just know this is going to spiral: I'll lose my focus, miss deadlines, lose clients, fall behind on rent, get evicted, and end up homeless and ruined — that chain is inevitable. I keep getting stuck on that future and it feels like it's already happening, even when people say I'm overreacting.

Therapist: I can see that the fear of losing your stability is really overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what it means to you to "get evicted and end up homeless"? What would it look like for you to be in a place where you have a stable home, a steady income, and a fulfilling art practice?

Patient: Eviction to me means not just losing a roof but everything that makes me feel like me — my canvases, my tools, my little corner where I make work — and then I'm literally sleeping in my car, feeling ashamed, too scattered to paint, and nobody's gonna take a chance on an artist who's a mess. In my head that slides so fast into missing shows, losing clients, losing income, and then nobody remembers my work — it's like I'm burnt out of existence. I can picture the opposite — a sunlit studio, regular commissions, a steady rent I can actually pay, friends who check in, and painting without that dull panic — but honestly that feels like a fantasy. Once I start telling myself the eviction story, I can't stop; it just proves it's going to happen, and thinking about the nicer version just feels naive.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of losing everything you've built is really suffocating you. I want to challenge the idea that the eviction story is inevitable. What would it take for you to start small, just a tiny step, to create a sense of stability and security, rather than getting caught up in the fear of the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Maybe I could try something tiny—like scheduling just 15 minutes to paint each morning, or setting up an automatic rent payment, or even just texting one friend to say, "Hey, I need a check-in." But as soon as I picture doing that, my brain goes, "You'll skip it, have one drink, forget the payment, get fees, the landlord will start sending notices, and boom—eviction and everything's lost," and I can't take the smaller steps seriously because that chain feels inevitable. I don't know, I want to believe the mini-steps could work, but it just feels naive and like I'm kidding myself.

Therapist: The thought that you're just kidding yourself is actually a clever survival mechanism, helping you avoid the discomfort of uncertainty. Let's gently challenge that thought: Can you simply acknowledge that the thought "I'll fail" is just a thought, and not necessarily a prediction of what will happen?

Patient: Okay — I can say it out loud: "That's just a thought." But saying it doesn't make it feel any less real — my brain immediately screams, "No, that's the truth," and stitches together the whole eviction-and-ruin story. Then I want to drink to quiet it, and I'm left feeling stuck and frustrated. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how to actually start believing it's only a thought.

Therapist: I'm not asking you to believe that the thought isn't real, but rather to create some space between the thought and your reaction to it. Can you take a moment to notice what would happen if you were to take a few deep breaths, and instead of trying to "make the thought go away," you simply observe it as a passing experience, like the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I tried a few deep breaths like you said. My chest loosened for a second and I could feel my feet, but then that fortune-telling voice gets louder and rebuilds the eviction story like the breath never happened. I want the breathing to help, but my brain screams I'll screw up the rent and end up homeless, so I just... I really want a drink to numb it.

Therapist: It sounds like the breathing isn't providing the long-term relief you're hoping for. Can you consider what might happen if, instead of using a drink to numb the pain, you used it to take a moment to get curious about the thought that's still lingering? What if, instead of trying to make it go away, you simply asked yourself, "What's driving the need for a drink right now?"

Patient: I think the urge to drink is basically to shut the noise off — to numb the grief and the constant eviction-movie my brain plays. When I try to get curious I just find more reasons to panic: "You missed a day, you'll miss a week, fees pile up, landlord notices" — and that just makes me want to drink harder. Even the idea of investigating the feeling feels useless because my mind already hands me the proof that everything will collapse. I want that curiosity to help, but I keep getting pulled back into the doom loop and I don't know how to stop it.

Therapist: It sounds like the investigation itself is becoming the thing that perpetuates the doom loop. What if, instead of trying to investigate the feeling, you simply acknowledged that the investigation itself is what's getting in the way? Can you consider a small, tiny willingness to take a single, tiny step towards creating a more stable future, without necessarily getting caught up in the worst-case scenario?

Patient: Okay—I could maybe try one tiny thing, like setting up autopay for rent tonight or committing to 15 minutes of painting tomorrow morning. But the minute I picture that, my brain yells, "You'll miss a payment, get fees, landlord notices, eviction," and it all feels pointless and inevitable. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this—can we slow down? I don't want to bail on doing something, I just keep getting dragged back into the worst-case movie and I don't know how to stop it.

Therapist: Let's take a step back. I want you to notice that the thought "You'll miss a payment" is just a thought, and it doesn't have to be the truth. Can you take a moment to simply acknowledge the feeling of overwhelm that's coming up, without trying to label it or fix it?

Patient: There's a heavy tightness in my chest, my breath is shallow, and my stomach's all knotted — my hands feel jittery too. I can let those sensations sit for a second without trying to do anything about them, but it still makes me want a drink to shut it up. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, bring your attention to the sensation in your chest. Notice it as a physical sensation, without judgment. Can you simply say to yourself, "I notice this sensation in my chest, and I'm feeling it"?

Patient: "I notice this sensation in my chest, and I'm feeling it." For a second it eased, but the fortune-telling voice is already back, stitching the eviction movie together and telling me I'll miss a payment. Now I really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of bailing.

Therapist: I'm here with you, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Can you offer yourself some kindness, even just for a moment? Would you be willing to take a small step towards kindness, like gently placing your hand on your chest, or acknowledging that you're doing the best you can right now?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest and it actually felt a little warmer, the tightness eased for a few breaths. But the fortune-telling voice is already back, telling me that if I relax now I'll forget a payment, lose a client, and end up evicted, so it all feels pointless and I want a drink to shut it up. I'm feeling shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist: I want to gently guide you back to the physical sensation in your hand on your chest. Notice that it's still feeling warmer, even as the thoughts are returning. Can you gently ask yourself, "What would happen if, instead of getting caught up in the thoughts, I simply allowed myself to be with the physical sensation of my hand on my chest, without judgment?"

Patient: I can try—when I stay with my hand on my chest for a breath it actually eases a bit, but the fortune-telling voice immediately rebuilds: I’ll relax, forget a payment, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction, lose my studio and clients, end up homeless and ruined. It makes the whole exercise feel pointless and I really want a drink to shut it up—can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist: It's like you're stuck in a loop. Can you try something different? Instead of trying to focus on the thoughts, can you simply observe the sensation of your hand still being on your chest, even as the thoughts are swirling around? Notice if there's any part of you that wants to let go of the hand, or if there's any part of you that wants to stay with it.

Patient: I can feel my hand there — it's warmer and a small part of me wants to stay with it like it's an anchor — but a louder part keeps trying to yank my hand away so I can reach for a drink and shut the noise up. The fortune-telling voice is already saying staying calm will make me forget a payment, get fees, get evicted, lose my studio, and be ruined, so I keep getting pulled into that movie. I'm shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Let's focus on the sensation of your hand on your chest. Can you gently ask yourself, "What's the purpose of the part of me that wants to pull my hand away?" What is that part of you trying to do?

Patient: I think that part is trying to protect me — it wants to shut the panic and shame off so I don't have to feel how terrifying the eviction-movie is. But its "protection" just jumps straight to numbing: it yanks my hand away so I can drink before I forget a payment, get fees, and end up ruined. I know it's trying to avoid pain, but I'm totally hooked by the doom-story and need help staying with the hand instead of bailing — can we slow down?

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the desperation behind the protective mechanism. Can you acknowledge that it's trying to help, but it's not working as intended? What if, instead of pulling your hand away, you simply allowed yourself to stay with the feeling of uncertainty, without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I can see that part is trying to protect me, even if it's screwing things up. I can try to stay with the uncertainty and keep my hand on my chest, but it feels like my grip is on sand and it's slipping. The instant I do, the fortune-telling voice yells about missed rent, notices, eviction, losing my studio, and I get shaky and want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying here instead of bailing — tell me what to do right now.

Therapist: I want you to focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, just the sensation of the breath, without trying to control it or change it? As you focus on the breath, notice how your hand on your chest feels in relation to the breath.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to focus on the breath: it's shallow but when I notice it my chest eases a little and my hand feels warmer. But the fortune-telling voice is already louder, yelling I'll miss rent, get fees, get evicted, lose my studio, and I want a drink to shut it up. I'm shaky and overwhelmed — can we slow down? I need help staying with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Let's try something new. I want you to notice that the fortune-telling voice is yelling, but it's not in your body. Can you say to yourself, "The voice is just a voice"? Just say it out loud, "The voice is just a voice".

Patient: "The voice is just a voice," I say out loud — but it lands like a lie. Immediately the doom movie starts up again—I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord notices, eviction—and a hot shame floods me, like some past screw-up proving it's true. I'm frustrated and feel stupid for not being able to quiet it; I really want a drink to shut it up, so can we slow down and sit with this a bit?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the shame and frustration. Can you say to yourself, "I am feeling shame and frustration right now, and it's okay"? Notice how the words feel in your body, the sensation of the shame and frustration. Allow yourself to feel it, without judgment or trying to change it.

Patient: "I am feeling shame and frustration right now, and it's okay." My chest's hot, my stomach's a knot, my face feels flushed and my hands are jittery — it all rushes back like that old screw-up proving the eviction-movie is true. I'm really shaky and want a drink to shut it up, so can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Can you bring your attention to your feet, just the sensation of your feet on the ground? Notice how they feel, the weight of your body, the sensation of the chair or floor beneath you. As you focus on your feet, can you say to yourself, "I am here, in this moment, with my feet on the ground"?

Patient: My feet are on the floor and I can feel the weight, the cold of the floor under my toes and the chair pressing into my thighs. But the voice is already screaming I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord will notice, and that hot shame from that old screw-up floods in like proof — I'm shaking and want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? I need help staying with my feet instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.

Therapist: Let's try something new. Can you say to yourself, "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice"? Not just say it, but actually say it out loud, with conviction. Say it again, and again, and again, until it feels more like a gentle reminder, rather than a desperate attempt to escape.

Patient: "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice." "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice." Saying it once felt a little steadier for a breath, but the fortune-telling voice is already yelling I'll miss rent, get fees, the landlord will notice — and that hot shame from that past screw-up floods back like proof. I'm shaky and really want a drink to shut it up; can we slow down? I need help staying with this instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say to yourself, "I am here, with my feet on the floor, and the voice is just a voice". Hold that phrase, and as you hold it, bring your attention to the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Try to stay with the breath, and let go of the thoughts. When you feel the thoughts starting to rise, gently acknowledge them, and come back to the breath.

Patient: I tried that — breathed in, said the phrase, and for a second it steadied me: my breath got a bit deeper and my hand felt warmer. But the fortune-telling voice slammed right back in, yelling I'll miss rent, fees, eviction, and this hot shame from that old screw-up floods me so I start shaking and really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me what to do right now to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Let's try something different. Can you place your hand on your knee, or on your thigh, or on your arm, somewhere in your body that feels like it's still and calm? Hold that hand on your chosen spot, and as you hold it, bring your attention to the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, and the feeling of your hand on your body.

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my thigh like you said and for one breath it felt kind of steady and warm, my inhale got a little deeper. But the fortune-telling voice slams back in yelling I'll miss the autopay, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction, lose my studio, and this hot shame from some past failure floods in like proof. I'm shaking and I really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me what to do right now to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Can you look around the room, notice the objects, the colors, the shapes, the texture of the chair or table? Bring your attention to the sensation of your hand on your thigh, and the sensation of your body in this space. Don't try to focus on the thoughts, just notice the sensations in your body, and the sights around you. Stay with this for just one more breath, and see if you can find some calm in the midst of the chaos.

Patient: There’s a messy easel by the window, a chipped blue mug, a stack of canvases — I notice the light and the chair under me, and my hand on my thigh feels warm for a second so I take a breath and it eases. But the voice is already screaming I’ll miss the autopay, fees pile up, landlord notices, eviction — and that hot shame rushes in like proof I messed up again. I’m shaky and really want a drink to shut it up — can we slow down? Tell me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Can you gently get up from the chair, and take a small step forward, just one small step, towards the easel by the window? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, and the movement of your body as you take that step. Don't worry about the thoughts, just focus on the physical sensation of the step, and the movement of your body.

Patient: I stand up slowly and take the step — my foot hits the floor, it’s cold, and for a beat the movement feels grounding. But the fortune-telling voice is already screaming that I’ll trip, knock over canvases, someone will see the mess, lose a client, miss rent, and then eviction is inevitable — and that hot shame bubbles up like proof I always screw up. I’m shaking and want a drink to quiet it; can we slow down? Tell me one tiny thing to do right now to keep my feet here instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.

Therapist: Can you take another small step, just one tiny step, to the left, and place your hand on the easel? Notice the sensation of your hand on the easel, the weight of your body on the floor, and the movement of your feet as you take that step. Don't worry about the thoughts, just focus on the physical sensation of the step and the movement of your body.

Patient: I put my hand on the easel — it's rough and smeared with paint, and for a single breath it actually steadied me and felt kind of real. But the fortune-telling voice is already screaming I'll trip, knock over canvases, lose a client, miss rent, and then eviction's inevitable, and that hot shame from that old screw-up floods in so I'm shaking and want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now to actually keep my feet here instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.

Therapist: Can you take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly let your hand slide down the easel, just a little bit, and rest it on your thigh again? Notice the sensation of your hand on your thigh, and the feeling of your body on the floor. Stay with this for just one more breath, and see if you can find some calm in the midst of the chaos.

Patient: I let my hand slide down and rest on my thigh — for one breath it actually felt calmer, my chest eased a little. But the fortune-telling voice is already back yelling about missed rent, fees, eviction, and that hot shame from some past screw-up floods me and I start shaking and wanting a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now to actually keep with the breath instead of spiraling.

Therapist: Can you take a small, tiny step to the right, just a tiny step, and place your foot on the edge of the rug? Notice the sensation of your foot touching the rug, and the feeling of your body shifting slightly. Stay with this for just one more breath, and see if you can find some stability in the midst of the chaos.

Patient: I put my foot on the rug — it felt softer and for a beat it actually grounded me. But the fortune-telling voice is already screaming I'll trip, knock over canvases, lose a client, miss rent, and that hot shame from that old screw-up floods in so I'm shaking and I really want a drink to shut it up. Can we slow down? Tell me one tiny, concrete thing to do right now to keep my feet here instead of getting yanked into the doom movie.
