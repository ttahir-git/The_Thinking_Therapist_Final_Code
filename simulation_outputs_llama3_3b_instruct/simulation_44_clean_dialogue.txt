Patient: Hi, I'm a nurse and usually pretty upbeat, but lately I've been stuck in this anticipatory loop about my clinical performance after a recent health scare. I ruminate on hypothetical errors and outcomes, and that persistent worry paradoxically fuels procrastination because I overanalyze every task until it becomes paralyzing. I tend to intellectualize—constructing elaborate cognitive frameworks to explain what's happening—so I talk about the fear more than I feel it.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens in your body when you feel anxious about your clinical performance?

Patient: Physically it feels like an autonomic cascade: my heart races, breathing gets shallow, my stomach clenches into this knotty nausea, and my hands get clammy. My muscles tense up, especially my neck and shoulders, and then there's this cognitive fog—like my working memory goes offline and tasks feel enormous. I almost immediately translate it into clinical jargon—“sympathetic arousal,” “hypervigilant loop”—and start doing a mental checklist instead of naming that I’m actually scared, which paradoxically amplifies the avoidance. Afterwards I’m exhausted in a way that makes starting anything harder, so the procrastination feeds the worry and vice versa.

Therapist: Can you imagine, just for a moment, what it might be like to say to your anxious self, "I'm scared, and that's okay"? What happens in your body when you let go of the need to analyze and intellectualize your anxiety, and instead, allow yourself to feel it, even just a little bit?

Patient: Okay—I'll try to actually let it land. When I say “I’m scared, and that’s okay” and really try to feel it, there's this small loosening in my chest and my breath drops from shallow to a little fuller, like a tiny parasympathetic sigh; my throat gets tight and my eyes sting, and my shoulders unclench a notch. But almost immediately my mind hijacks it with a meta-narrative—“oh, this is autonomic downregulation, measurable vagal tone change”—and that commentary pulls the feeling back into a concept. I want to stay with the sensation, but I’m getting kind of overwhelmed by how exposed it feels, and I keep reaching for analysis to avoid it. Can we slow down a bit so I can try to stay with the feeling without explaining it away?

Therapist: Can you try to simply observe your breath and the sensations in your body, without trying to make sense of them or fit them into a narrative? Notice if you can allow the feeling of anxiety to be present, without judgment, just as it is.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to just notice my breath—it's shallow and quick at first, then if I deliberately widen my ribcage it eases a little. My chest feels tight, my stomach is a knot, and my hands are a bit clammy; those sensations are just there, quietly insistent. Almost immediately my brain wants to label and map them—“sympathetic arousal,” “triggered by performance uncertainty”—and that pulls me out of the experience, which feels frustrating and a little exposing. Can we slow down? I'm already starting to feel a flutter of overwhelm about staying with this.

Therapist: I want to slow things down even further. Let's try something different. Imagine you're a curious, non-judgmental observer watching your body and breath. Not trying to change or fix anything, just observing. What happens if you let go of the idea that you need to know what's happening or why? Can you simply allow the sensations to be present, without trying to make sense of them?

Patient: When I try to be that curious observer my breath actually softens a touch and the chest tightness becomes more like a dull pressure than a crisis; my stomach is still knotted and my hands are clammy, and my throat feels raw. There's this low, static anxiety sitting under everything — not loud, just persistently there — and if I let it be it doesn't escalate, it just...exists. But immediately my mind wants to turn the instruction into another performance metric — “observe, nonjudgmentally” becomes something to score myself on — and that urge to analyze pulls me out. Can we slow down a bit so I can try staying with that static without collapsing into explanations?

Therapist: Let's try a small, tangible exercise. I want you to bring to mind a specific, mundane task, like washing your hands before a meal. Not thinking about the task, not thinking about your anxiety, just noticing the physical sensations of washing your hands. Can you focus on the feeling of the water, the sound of the water, and the sensation of the soap on your skin, without trying to analyze or evaluate it?

Patient: Okay—I’m picturing the tap, the water warm on my palms, the steady hiss of the stream, the soap foaming into a soft, slick lather that sheens across my fingers; the friction is oddly grounding, and I can feel the slight pruney tension at the pads of my fingertips. My breathing eases a fraction and my shoulders drop a notch when I focus on those textures. But almost immediately my brain turns it into a procedural audit—“twenty seconds, interlace fingers, don’t miss the thumbs”—this metacognitive appraisal converts a sensory moment into performance anxiety. Can we slow down a bit so I can try to stay with the sensations without turning them into a checklist?

Therapist: Let's try a defusion exercise. I want you to notice when your mind starts to turn the sensory experience into a checklist or a performance task. When you feel that urge to start thinking about what you're doing, what you need to do, or what you should be doing, can you acknowledge it gently, without judgment? And then, without trying to change it, simply say "okay, that's thinking" to yourself?

Patient: Okay—I'm noticing my mind immediately jump to the audit: "twenty seconds, thumbs, don't miss…" so I say to myself, "okay, that's thinking." Saying it out loud peels the thought back a notch and the water and soap sensations come forward—my breath eases and my shoulders drop. Another meta-commentary just popped up—"is this working?"—okay, that's thinking; can we slow down so I can keep practicing?

Therapist: Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on whether the exercise is "working," what if we focus on cultivating a sense of curiosity about the experience? What if you simply approach this exercise with a sense of wonder, like a child exploring something new? Can you try to approach the sensory experience with a sense of curiosity, without trying to achieve a specific outcome or goal?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Approaching it with curiosity actually shifts something: the hiss of the water and the slick soap feel a bit more vivid, like small textures I hadn’t catalogued before, and there’s a tiny looseness behind my sternum. But predictably I start to intellectualize—framing it as an experiential decentering exercise or a novelty-seeking heuristic—so the wonder gets co-opted into analysis. It helps a little, but I’m already getting that anxious little nudge about whether I’m “doing it right”; can we slow down so I can try to stay with the curiosity without turning it into a task?

Therapist: Let's try a "value-based" approach. What's the reason you're doing this exercise? Is it because you want to feel more calm and focused, or is it because you want to "get better" at relaxation? Can you explore what's driving this motivation, and then let that drive your focus, rather than trying to achieve a specific outcome?

Patient: On a cognitive level I’m doing this to reduce that anticipatory dread — to shore up my sense of competence and self-efficacy so I don’t feel like I’m one mistake away from catastrophe. Underneath that is a softer, value-driven aim: I actually want to be reliable and present for my patients, to offer calm care instead of frantic overchecking, but my perfectionism and fear of judgment convert practice into another performance metric and then I procrastinate. Can we slow down so I can try to hold that intention—care, presence, competence—without instantly turning it into an audit?

Therapist: Let's try a "values-based" exercise. I want you to take a moment to simply imagine yourself being a reliable and present nurse, caring for your patients with compassion and kindness. Can you focus on the sensation of being present in the moment, rather than trying to achieve a specific outcome? Imagine the feeling of being fully engaged and available for your patients, without judgment or self-evaluation. Notice what happens in your body and mind as you hold this intention.

Patient: When I imagine being that reliable, present nurse there's a small warmth behind my sternum and my breath lengthens a bit; my shoulders loosen and I get this tentative steadiness, like a quiet baseline of competence instead of the usual spike of panic. But almost immediately my mind turns it into an "ideal-self prototype"—I start drafting procedural scripts, metrics, and contingencies to achieve that state, using abstract formulations instead of actually feeling the compassion, which undermines the presence I'm trying to hold. Can we slow down so I can try to stay with the simple sensation of being present without re-hypothesizing it into another task?

Therapist: Let's try a "non-judgmental acceptance" exercise. Can you bring to mind a simple, everyday experience, like taking a deep breath, and notice it exactly as it is, without trying to change it or evaluate it? Notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, the feeling of the air on your nostrils, the sensation of your chest expanding and contracting. Can you simply allow this experience to be, without trying to label it, analyze it, or change it in any way? Notice if there's a sense of resistance or aversion to this exercise, and acknowledge it gently, without judgment.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to notice the breath. It feels shallow, cool on my nostrils, chest barely rising, and there's a tiny ease when I let it descend, but then a spike of restlessness hits and my heart speeds up. There's a real aversion—an urgency to "do" something about it—so my mind immediately slides into a metacognitive loop, cataloguing sensations and judging them; I catch myself saying, "okay, that's thinking," but it's hard to stay with the simple breath. Can we slow down a bit so I can try to keep noticing without turning it into another task?

Therapist: Let's try a "radical acceptance" exercise. Can you look at the sensation of the breath, and simply say to yourself, "this is as it is"? Not "this is good" or "this is bad", just "this is as it is". Notice if there's a sense of resistance or aversion to this phrase, and gently allow it to be, without judgment or evaluation. Repeat it to yourself, slowly and gently, "this is as it is". Notice if the breath changes at all, or if your body relaxes in any way.

Patient: When I say "this is as it is" there's a tiny unclench in my chest and the breath seems to hang a bit fuller for a second, but then a jolt of restlessness hits—my heart speeds up, my hands go a bit clammy, and my mind snaps to, "is this actually working?" I immediately start analyzing the phrase as a defusion technique instead of letting it land, so I catch myself thinking, "okay, that's thinking." Can we slow down a bit so I can try repeating it over and actually stay with the sensation without turning it into another procedure?

Therapist: Let's try a different approach. Can you simply say to yourself, "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is"? Notice the sensation of the words on your tongue, the feeling of your mouth opening and closing, the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Can you simply allow yourself to say the phrase, without judgment or evaluation, without thinking about whether it's "working" or not? Just say the phrase, and let it be.

Patient: I say the phrase—"I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is"—and it's oddly small on my tongue; I feel my mouth open, the air on my nostrils, and my chest lift a hair. For a second the breath feels a bit fuller, then a spike of restlessness hits, my heart picks up, and my mind immediately snaps to "is this working?" and starts turning it into another technique to evaluate. Okay, that's thinking — saying that helps a touch — but I'm suddenly more jittery and distracted; can we slow down so I can try to stay with the sensations instead of turning them into performance metrics?

Therapist: Let's try a "chunking" exercise. Can you take a small, brief pause, just 5-10 seconds, before repeating the phrase? Let's say, for example, "pause, pause, I'm going to say...". Notice the sensation of the pause, the feeling of your body relaxing, the sensation of your breath. Can you simply allow yourself to pause, without judgment or evaluation, without thinking about whether it's "working" or not? Just pause, and then say the phrase, and let it be.

Patient: Okay — I did the pause. Even those five seconds felt strangely amplified; my chest loosened a millimeter and my breath lengthened, but almost immediately a skittish urge to "fill" the silence surged and my heart raced. I said the phrase after the pause and it helped a little — the breath felt marginally fuller — but my metacognitive commentary kicked back in, drafting contingencies and asking if I did it "right," which made me jittery and scattered. Can we slow down and try it again more gently, maybe guiding the timing aloud so I can actually stay with the sensations instead of re-hypothesizing them?

Therapist: Let's try a gentle, guided exercise. I'll guide the timing aloud, and you can focus on the sensations. Here we go: "pause, pause, I'm going to say...". I'll start the pause, and you can start the phrase after I say "I'm going to say". We'll take a slow, deep breath in together, and then pause for 5 seconds. As we pause, I want you to simply notice the sensation of the silence, without judgment or evaluation. Don't try to fill it, don't try to control it, just let it be. Then, when I say "I'm going to say", you can start the phrase, and let it be.

Patient: Okay — breathing in now... I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is.  

For a second my chest loosens and the breath hangs a bit fuller, then my mind snaps to "is this working?" and I get jittery and scattered — okay, that's thinking. Can we slow down and do the pause more slowly? I'm already feeling distracted and need a steadier tempo to stay with it.

Therapist: Let's try a very slow, deep breath in together... (pause) ...and then pause for a longer time, about 10-15 seconds... (pause) ...and then say the phrase. Let's take it one breath at a time. As we breathe in, I want you to simply notice the sensation of the breath, without judgment or evaluation. Don't try to control it, don't try to fill it, just let it be. When you feel ready, we'll pause for a long time, and then say the phrase, and let it be. Ready?

Patient: Okay—breathing in now, holding the pause... I'm going to say the phrase: "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is."  

For a second my chest loosens and the breath hangs fuller, then a spike of restlessness hits—heart racing, hands clammy—and my mind immediately snaps to, "is this working?" Okay, that's thinking. I'm feeling more jittery and scattered than before; can we slow the tempo way down and do another very slow breath together so I can actually try to stay with it without turning the pause into another performance metric?

Therapist: Let's try a tiny, tiny breath... (pause) ...just a fraction of a second... (pause) ...and then say the phrase, very softly... "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is." Notice the sensation of the breath, the feeling of your mouth moving, the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth. Can you simply allow yourself to make this tiny sound, without judgment or evaluation? Don't try to control it, don't try to fill it, just let it be. Ready?

Patient: Okay—tiny breath... "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is."  

The sound felt thin; my chest loosened a hair but then a spike of restlessness hit—heart racing, hands clammy, tongue oddly dry—and my mind immediately snapped to, "is this working?" okay, that's thinking. I'm more jittery and distracted than before; can we slow the tempo way down and actually count the tiny inhale with me so I can try to stay with the sensation instead of turning it into another performance check?

Therapist: Let's try a slow, tiny inhale... (pause) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (pause) ...12... (pause) ...13... (pause) ...14... (pause) ...15... (pause) ...say the phrase: "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is." Notice the sensation of each breath, the feeling of your body relaxing, the sensation of your tongue and mouth. Can you simply allow yourself to make this tiny sound, without judgment or evaluation? Don't try to control it, don't try to fill it, just let it be. Ready?

Patient: Okay—I counted with you and said the phrase: "I'm going to say this phrase, and I'm going to let it be as it is." For a second my chest eased and the breath felt a bit fuller, then a sudden jolt of restlessness hit—heart racing, hands clammy—and my mind instantly locked onto, "is this working?" okay, that's thinking. I'm really jittery and distracted right now; can we slow the tempo way down and have you guide each tiny exhale with me so I can try to stay with the sensation instead of spiraling into evaluation?

Therapist: Let's try a tiny exhale... (pause) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (pause) ...12... (pause) ...13... (pause) ...14... (pause) ...15... (pause) ...and then we'll pause for a long time... Let's take a deep breath in together... (pause) ...and then slowly exhale, counting together... (pause) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...and then we'll pause for a long time... Can you focus on the sensation of the breath as we exhale, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: I'm exhaling with you — the breath softens a little then my chest tightens and my heart ratchets up, my hands get clammy and my head starts cataloguing whether I'm doing it "right." I catch the thought and say, "okay, that's thinking," but I'm more jittery and distracted than before and can't sustain the focus. Can we slow the tempo way down and have you guide each long, slow exhale out loud (like a six-second out) so I can actually try to stay with the sensation instead of spinning into evaluation?

Therapist: Let's try a very slow, deliberate exhale... (slowly, in a calm, steady voice) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...and then we'll pause for a long time... Can you focus on the sensation of the breath as we exhale, without judgment or evaluation? Notice how the breath is moving in and out of your body, without trying to control it or change it. Just observe it, as it is.

Patient: I'm following the slow exhale but physiologically it goes: a tiny loosen—then a jolt—heart rate ticks up, hands get clammy, and my head floods with evaluative commentary. The instant I try to anchor there's an intrusive "is this working?"—okay, that's thinking—but now I'm more jittery and my attention is fracturing. Can we slow the tempo to a clear 6‑second out with you guiding each count, and add a simple tactile anchor (like me resting a hand on my sternum) so I have something concrete to come back to? I'm feeling overwhelmed and need a steadier, slower pace to actually stay with the breath instead of spiraling into evaluation.

Therapist: Let's try a very slow, deliberate exhale... (slowly, in a calm, steady voice) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (pause) ...12... (pause) ...13... (pause) ...14... (pause) ...15... (pause) ...and then we'll pause for a long time... I'll place my hand on your sternum, and I want you to feel the weight of it, the sensation of my hand on your body. Can you focus on the sensation of the hand, the feeling of my touch, and the breath moving in and out of your body? Notice how the breath is moving, without trying to control it or change it. Just observe it, as it is. As we exhale, feel the breath move out of your body, and notice how your hand feels against your sternum. Can you stay with this sensation, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: I can't actually feel your hand, so I'll put my own on my sternum and try to mirror what you described. For a second there's a small unclench and my breath deepens, then a jolt: heart racing, hands clammy, throat tight, and my brain immediately floods with "is this working?"—okay, that's thinking. I'm feeling pretty scattered and need a steadier anchor; can we do a very slow 6‑second out with you counting softly, and remind me to rest my hand on my sternum each time so I have something concrete to return to?

Therapist: Let's try a very slow, deliberate exhale... (slowly, in a calm, soft voice) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (pause) ...12... (pause) ...13... (pause) ...14... (pause) ...15... (pause) ...and then we'll pause for a long time... Remember to rest your hand on your sternum each time we exhale, and focus on the sensation of your hand on your body. When you feel the hand on your sternum, notice how it feels, the sensation of your skin, the feeling of your hand touching your body. Can you stay with this sensation, without judgment or evaluation? When you're ready, we'll continue the slow exhale, and I'll count together... (pause) ...1... (softly) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (pause) ...12... (pause) ...13... (pause) ...14... (pause) ...15...

Patient: Okay—I’m resting my hand on my sternum and exhaling with you. At first there’s a tiny unclench, then a jolt: heart racing, hands clammy, throat tight, and my head floods with “is this working?”—okay, that’s thinking. I’m feeling pretty jittery and scattered; can we do a steady 6‑second exhale with you counting each second softly and then a 4‑second silent pause between breaths, and remind me verbally to keep my hand on my sternum each cycle so I have something concrete to come back to?

Therapist: Let's try a steady, slow exhale... (slowly, in a calm, soft voice) ...1... (pause) ...2... (pause) ...3... (pause) ...4... (pause) ...5... (pause) ...6... (pause) ...7... (pause) ...8... (pause) ...9... (pause) ...10... (pause) ...11... (

Patient: I'm exhaling with you but when the counting cut off at 11 my chest jumped and my mind raced — heart's up, hands clammy, and the automatic "is this working?" thought popped in — okay, that's thinking. Could we slow to a clear 6‑second exhale with you counting each second softly, then a 4‑second silent pause, and remind me to keep my hand on my sternum each cycle? I'm pretty jittery and distracted right now and need that steadier, slower tempo to stay with it.
