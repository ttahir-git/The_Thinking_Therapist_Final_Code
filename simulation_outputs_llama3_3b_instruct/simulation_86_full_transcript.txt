--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my mid-fifties, used to managing teams, and lately the job instability and recent loss have left me with this low-grade sadness and inertia that's starting to bleed into my marriage. I'm very action-oriented and can map out the cognitive distortions and PTSD triggers in detail, but when you ask me how it feels I almost always default to analysis instead of actually naming the raw emotion.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to pinpoint the raw emotion beneath your analysis, which suggests that you're trying to cope with the pain by maintaining control over the narrative. The recent loss and job instability may have led to feelings of insecurity and uncertainty, which are uncomfortable to acknowledge. Goal: Explore the emotional experience behind the "low-grade sadness" to access a more concrete emotional tone.

Therapist Answer:
What's the first thing that happens in your body when you think about your marriage or your current situation? Is there a physical sensation, like tension, numbness, or a lump in your throat?

Patient: Physiologically, the first thing is a tightening — chest constricts, throat feels a bit like there's a lump, and my shoulders go up like I'm bracing. I can talk about it in neurobiological terms — sympathetic activation, shallow breathing, muscle tension — which is my go-to instead of actually sitting in the rawness of it. I notice that once I label it, I tend to start dissecting it rather than letting the sensation be.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your physiological response is a clear indication of the emotional weight you're carrying, and labeling it is a step towards acknowledging the experience. However, your tendency to dissect and analyze it further indicates that you're trying to maintain control over the emotional process. This pattern may be rooted in past experiences where over-analyzing emotions was a coping mechanism. Goal: Create space for a more embodied experience by allowing yourself to be with the physical sensations without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Can you bring your attention back to that physical sensation in your chest, throat, and shoulders, and simply say it to yourself without trying to analyze it further? Just acknowledge it as "this tightness" or "this lump in my throat" without adding any labels or interpretations.

Patient: This tightness. This lump in my throat. I can name it, but as soon as I do I feel the pull to intellectualize—map triggers, timeline, cortisol response—rather than actually sit with the sensation.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the pull to intellectualize, which indicates that you're familiar with the pattern of analysis paralysis. This cycle can be challenging to break, but it's essential to develop a new relationship with your emotions. Goal: Practice a brief, embodied mindfulness exercise to create a small window for defusion.

Therapist Answer:
I'd like to try something simple. Let's take a deep breath together, and as you exhale, I want you to bring your attention back to the physical sensations in your body, without trying to label or analyze them. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and gently allow the sensations in your chest, throat, and shoulders to be present, without trying to do anything about them.

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing with you. As I inhale it's almost mechanical, shallow, and on the exhale the lump in my throat softens a touch and the chest tightness loosens a notch, though my shoulders stay hunched like I'm bracing. The impulse to start dissecting everything is loud — timelines, causes, 'what happened' — and it yanks me out of just feeling; how do you want me to handle that pull when it shows up?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in acknowledging and softening the physical sensations, but the intellectualization pull is still present. It's essential to develop a strategy to cope with this impulsive reaction. Goal: Introduce a small, value-driven behavioral step to help you stay with the emotional experience and build resistance to intellectualization.

Therapist Answer:
Notice how the impulse to dissect is making you feel, without judgment. Instead of trying to stop it, I want you to consider what you might lose if you give in to that impulse. What's the value of staying with the emotional experience, even if it's uncomfortable, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about what happened or how to analyze it?

Patient: I can see the value: staying with the feeling might actually allow the affect to move through me instead of calcifying into chronic low-grade sadness, and it could create a realer connection with my partner instead of this defensive distance. But I also fear the costs — losing the illusion of competence, getting overwhelmed by shame or panic, or unraveling memories I’ve kept neatly compartmentalized — so my brain defaults to analysis as a protective maneuver. When that pull to dissect shows up, I'm not sure how to notice it without immediately launching into explanation; what would you suggest I do in that moment?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware of the potential benefits and risks of staying with the emotional experience, and you're recognizing the fear that drives your analysis. This indicates a desire to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed or exposed. Goal: Introduce a subtle, experiential strategy to help you notice the intellectualization pull without judgment, while acknowledging the underlying values and fears.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine a small, imperfect "pass" or "yield" in your response to the pull to analyze? Just a tiny gap where you say "ah" or "hmm" and let the thought go, without judgment, without elaborating or trying to control it? This can create a small opening for you to explore the value of staying with the emotional experience.

Patient: Okay, I'll try that now: "ah"... "hmm." It did open a tiny aperture — my throat softened for a beat — but immediately the internal commentator started rehearsing reasons to analyze, like it's a stabilizing protocol. I can theorize why the pass disrupts those automatic cognitive chains, but sustaining it feels hard because the urge to explain feels urgent and protective; how do I keep that gap from closing?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've successfully created a brief gap, but the urge to analyze is still present, and it's understandable that it feels urgent and protective. This suggests that you're trying to maintain a sense of control and mastery over your emotions. Goal: Introduce a new metaphor to help you think about this process and create a more embodied experience.

Therapist Answer:
Can you imagine that the internal commentator is like a tight rope walker? When you take a step back and say "ah" or "hmm", you're not letting go of the rope, but rather giving yourself a small amount of slack. What if, instead of trying to re-tighten the rope, you allowed yourself to lean into the uncertainty, like you're allowing the rope to sag a little bit? This might help you develop a sense of trust in the process, rather than needing to control it.

Patient: I can see the logic — loosening the rope could reduce hypervigilance and let the affectual stuff move instead of calcifying — and I can visualize doing it. But when I actually try, my chest tightens, the internal commentator immediately writes a contingency plan, and I get this panic about appearing incompetent or unraveling things I've kept organized. I can try to let the rope sag for a few breaths now, but honestly I already feel the pull to re-tighten and I'm not sure how long I can hold it without defaulting back to analysis.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in visualizing the rope as a metaphor, but the actual experience is proving to be more challenging than expected. The tension in your chest and the need to re-tighten the rope suggests that you're still struggling with feelings of vulnerability and fear of losing control. Goal: Introduce a new, more experiential approach to help you stay with the emotional experience, even when it becomes uncomfortable.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something different. Instead of trying to hold onto the rope, imagine that you're standing on the ground, with your feet firmly planted. Feel the sensation of your feet connecting with the earth, and allow yourself to rest in that sense of grounding. As you exhale, say to yourself, "I am present with this feeling, and I am allowing it to be." No need to do anything about it, just be with it.

Patient: Okay — I'm planting my feet and I can actually feel a subtle heaviness under my soles, like a crude but tangible anchor. On the exhale I said, "I am present with this feeling, and I am allowing it to be," and it did loosen the lump in my throat a fraction, which is surprising given how reflexively I default to cognitive scaffolding. But the internal commentator is already drafting contingency plans and narratives to re-tighten the rope; can you coach me through keeping that slack open longer, because I can see the value but I don't know how to sustain it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've successfully anchored yourself and allowed a small amount of slack, but the internal commentator is still at work. It's essential to address the underlying need for control and mastery that's driving the narrative. Goal: Introduce a new strategy to help you stay with the emotional experience, focusing on the value of impermanence and the benefits of allowing things to unfold.

Therapist Answer:
Let's explore the idea that the slack is not a static state, but rather a process. Imagine that the rope is not a fixed entity, but rather a dynamic system that can change and adapt. As you breathe, allow yourself to think, "What if the slack is not something I need to hold onto, but rather something that I can let unfold?" Notice how that feels, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I am allowing the rope to unfold, and I am trusting in its natural unfolding."

Patient: I said it — "I am allowing the rope to unfold" — and there was a tiny diaphragmatic release, my throat unclenched a notch, but then the internal commentator immediately kicked into a full risk-assessment: what if I collapse, what about competence, liability, narratives to tidy this up. I can theorize about why that reflex exists (threat detection, identity preservation), but honestly I'm frustrated at how fast it yanks me back into analysis. What concrete, short anchor could I use in the moment to keep that slack open longer without turning it into another thing to manage?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've made progress in allowing the rope to unfold, but the internal commentator is still reasserting itself. It's essential to develop a new anchor that can help you stay with the emotional experience, without adding another layer of complexity. Goal: Introduce a simple, experiential anchor that can help you bridge the gap between the emotional experience and the internal commentary.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a brief, non-judgmental phrase: "okay". Just say "okay" to yourself as you breathe, without adding any thoughts, emotions, or interpretations. Use a very soft, gentle voice, and focus on the sensation of the words on your tongue. This phrase can serve as a subtle reminder that you're not trying to control or manage the emotions, but rather simply acknowledging the present moment.

Patient: I tried it — said "okay" softly on an exhale, and there was a small unclenching, a beat of relief, but the internal commentator immediately turned it into a task, drafting contingencies and timelines. I'm frustrated — it feels like even acceptance gets co-opted into another control strategy. What concrete, brief anchor would you suggest so "okay" doesn't just become another thing for my brain to manage?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems that the internal commentator is persistently trying to turn even the most seemingly simple and accepting phrases into another layer of control. Goal: Introduce a new anchor that can help you bypass the commentary and connect directly with the emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a brief, experiential anchor that involves the body. As you exhale, bring your attention to your feet on the ground and say "heavy" to yourself. Not "I am heavy," but just the word "heavy". Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of weight in your body. This anchor is designed to engage the body's proprioceptive system, which can help you connect directly with your physical sensations, bypassing the commentary and intellectualization.

Patient: I tried it — said "heavy" on the exhale and actually felt my weight settle into my feet for a beat; my chest softened and my shoulders loosened a notch. Of course, five seconds later the internal commentator was grading the exercise — "am I doing it right, is this enough?" — and the grounding faded. I'm irritated: it feels like even somatic anchors get co-opted into another performance metric. How do I keep the bodily sense from turning into a checklist?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It seems that the internal commentator is still driving a desire for control and evaluation, even with the most basic bodily anchors. Goal: Introduce a new strategy to help you stay with the sensation, without getting caught up in self-evaluation.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a different approach. Instead of focusing on the sensation of your feet on the ground or the word "heavy", try simply saying "stop" to the commentary. As you breathe, say "stop" to the internal commentary, and notice what happens. Don't try to stop it, just acknowledge the intention to stop it. This can help you interrupt the commentary cycle and create space for a more direct connection with your bodily sensations.

Patient: I tried it — I said "stop" on the exhale and the internal chatter hiccuped for a beat; my throat unclenched a notch, but then it immediately recontextualized "stop" into another task — "are you stopping properly?" — and escalated into meta-commentary. I'm annoyed and honestly a little exasperated: everything becomes data to be managed, and I can't tell if that's a technique failure or my pathological need for competence. Can you coach me through a single exhale step‑by‑step right now, because if I'm left to do it alone the commentator just hijacks it.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is having a strong grip on your mind, and you're struggling to find a way to stay with the body. Goal: Introduce a more radical approach to help you break free from the commentary's hold.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try something entirely different. As you inhale, say "I am here" to yourself. Not "I am breathing," or "I am present," but simply "I am here". Don't think about it, just say the words. As you exhale, say "now". Just "now". Don't try to elaborate, don't try to control it, just say the words "I am here now".

Patient: I did it — inhaled "I am here," exhaled "now," and there was this tiny unclench, like a millisecond of actual presence. But of course the internal commentator immediately turned it into performance evaluation and meta‑commentary — "are you doing it right?" — which pulls me back into analysis and irritates me. Can you walk me through three breaths step‑by‑step, telling me exactly when to inhale and say the words, so I can try to sustain it without launching into explanations?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still a persistent presence, but we've made some progress in creating a small window of presence. Goal: Use this new anchor to develop a more sustained connection with your body, while minimizing the commentary.

Therapist Answer:
Here's a step-by-step guide for the next three breaths:

1. Inhale for a count of 4: Feel the breath moving in, and as you inhale, say to yourself: "I am here".
2. Hold for a count of 2: Just hold the breath, and don't say anything. Don't think about it, don't analyze it. Just be with the sensation of the breath.
3. Exhale for a count of 4: As you exhale, say to yourself: "now".
4. Hold for a count of 2: Again, just hold the breath, and be with the sensation.
5. Inhale for a count of 4: Repeat the cycle, inhaling "I am here", holding, exhaling "now", holding, and inhaling "I am here" again.

As you do this, try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, and don't worry about the commentary. Just repeat the words, and see if you can sustain the presence for a few breaths.

Patient: I did the three-breath cycle you gave me. There was a small loosening each time — throat unclenched, chest softened, and my feet felt a bit more anchored — like a brief millisecond of actual presence on the “now.” But right after each cycle the internal commentator immediately started grading and planning, and that pulls me straight back into analysis. Can you coach me through another set and give a concrete tactic for when the commentator turns this into another thing to do?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still a persistent presence, and we need to develop a strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a new tactic to help you break the commentary's hold and stay with the presence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try a new approach. As you inhale "I am here", I want you to add a small, almost imperceptible pause between the words. Just a tiny gap, like a small breath. This will create a subtle distinction between the anchor phrase and the commentary's attempts to hijack it.

Now, as you exhale "now", I want you to use a very small, almost imperceptible whisper: "yes". Just a tiny, almost inaudible "yes". Don't think about it, don't try to analyze it. Just whisper "yes" as you exhale.

When the commentary tries to take over, and you feel the urge to analyze, just notice the whisper "yes" and gently let it go. Don't try to control it, just allow it to fade away. Focus on the physical sensations in your body, and try to stay with the presence.

Let's do another cycle.

Patient: I did it — tiny pause between "I am" and "here," whispered a barely audible "yes" on the exhale, and there was a palpable diaphragmatic release: throat loosened, shoulders eased, feet felt a touch heavier. Predictably, the internal commentator reconstituted itself immediately, turning the exercise into a metacognitive audit ("am I doing it right?"), which makes me irritated and suspicious that even acceptance is just another performance metric. Can you coach me through a concrete, step‑by‑step sequence for, say, ten breaths that includes a simple cue when the commentator pops up, because I can see the value but I keep getting yanked back into analysis?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that you're making progress, but the commentary is still a persistent presence. We need to develop a more robust strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a step-by-step sequence to help you stay with the presence and avoid getting pulled back into analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's create a sequence that includes a simple cue to help you interrupt the commentary. Here's a step-by-step guide for ten breaths:

1. Inhale for a count of 4, inhale "I am here".
2. Hold for a count of 2, with a tiny pause between "I am" and "here".
3. Exhale for a count of 4, whisper "yes".
4. Hold for a count of 2, just holding the whisper.
5. Inhale for a count of 4, say "the" (just the word "the", without thinking or analyzing).
6. Hold for a count of 2, holding the word "the".
7. Exhale for a count of 4, say "now".
8. Hold for a count of 2, just holding the word "now".
9. Inhale for a count of 4, say "I am" (just the word "I am", without thinking or analyzing).
10. Hold for a count of 2, holding the word "I am".

As you breathe, pay attention to the sensation of the words on your tongue, and try to stay with the physical sensations in your body. If the commentary starts to pop up, just notice the whispered "yes" and let it fade away. If you feel the urge to analyze, focus on the word "the" and try to let it be.

The sequence is designed to create a gentle, soothing rhythm, and the phrase "the" serves as a subtle cue to interrupt the commentary. Try to stay with the physical sensations and avoid getting caught up in analysis.

Patient: I did the ten-breath cycle — there was a real, noticeable loosening each time (throat unclenched, shoulders dropped, feet felt heavier), but predictably the internal commentator immediately rebranded the whole thing into a performance review, drafting grades and contingencies. I’m irritated — it feels like even these anchors become another metric to manage, which makes me suspicious of the technique and of myself. Can you give me one single, concrete micro-action to use the instant the commentator pops up (something physical or a two‑word cue), and coach me through doing it right now so it doesn’t just turn into another thing to do?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that you're frustrated with the commentary's tendency to rebrand the anchors as another metric to manage. Goal: Introduce a single, concrete micro-action to interrupt the commentary and help you stay with the presence.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use a simple, physical cue: when the commentary pops up, touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth. This subtle action can help interrupt the commentary's flow and bring you back to the present moment.

To practice, I want you to focus on the sensation of your tongue touching the roof of your mouth as you breathe. As you inhale, touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and hold for a brief moment (about a second). As you exhale, release your tongue from the roof of your mouth and focus on the physical sensations in your body.

Let's practice this micro-action together. Inhale and touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth. Hold for a second... exhale and release... notice the physical sensations in your body.

Patient: I did it — inhaled, pressed my tongue to the roof of my mouth for a beat, exhaled and released, and there was that familiar micro-unclench: throat softened, shoulders dropped a notch, feet felt a touch heavier. Of course, within two heartbeats the internal commentator was back: "Are you doing that right? Is this even enough?" — and it immediately reframed it as another performance metric, which makes me irritated and a little ashamed.

Can you coach me through another round, step‑by‑step with counts, and tell me exactly what to do the instant the commentator says "are you doing it right?" — I need one concrete sentence I can say to myself in that moment that isn't another thing to perform. Also, I want to try it twice more right now with your guidance.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still a persistent presence, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a single, concrete sentence to help you respond to the commentary in a way that doesn't reinforce the performance metric.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use the following sentence: "Not now."

To practice, we'll do another round. Here's the step-by-step guide:

1. Inhale for a count of 4, inhale "I am here".
2. Hold for a count of 2, with a tiny pause between "I am" and "here".
3. Exhale for a count of 4, whisper "yes".
4. Hold for a count of 2, just holding the whisper.
5. Inhale for a count of 4, say "the".
6. Hold for a count of 2, holding the word "the".
7. Exhale for a count of 4, say "now".
8. Hold for a count of 2, just holding the word "now".

As we get to the part where you hear the commentary say "are you doing it right?", I want you to respond with the sentence "Not now". Just say the words, without thinking or analyzing, and focus on the physical sensations in your body.

Let's try it now. Inhale... inhale "I am here". Hold... exhale "yes". Hold... inhale "the". Hold... exhale "now". Ready?

(Note: Remember to say "Not now" as soon as you hear the commentary say "are you doing it right?")

We'll do two more rounds.

Patient: I did the two rounds just now exactly as you scripted: inhaled "I am here" (4), tiny pause, exhaled "yes" (4) with the tongue-to-roof micro‑press when the commentator popped up — I said "Not now" as you instructed and it hiccuped; my throat unclenched and my shoulders dropped for a beat. But predictably it immediately recontextualized "Not now" into another metric — "is this avoidance?" — and yanked me straight back into metacognition, which is making me irritated and honestly a bit overwhelmed. Can you coach me through another set of five breaths with exact, on-the-spot wording and a non‑performative physical cue for when the commentator re‑frames "Not now," because I can feel the value but I keep getting hijacked.

Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still trying to reframe "Not now" as another performance metric, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a non-performative physical cue to help you stay with the presence, even when the commentary tries to reframe your response.

Therapist Answer:
Let's use the following sequence:

1. Inhale for a count of 4, inhale "I am here".
2. Hold for a count of 2, with a tiny pause between "I am" and "here".
3. Exhale for a count of 4, whisper "yes".
4. Hold for a count of 2, just holding the whisper.
5. Inhale for a count of 4, say "I am".

As we get to the part where you hear the commentary say "are you doing it right?", I want you to respond with the words "I'm here". Just say the words, without thinking or analyzing, and focus on the physical sensations in your body.

When the commentator re-frames "Not now" as "is this avoidance?", I want you to gently pinch the bridge of your nose. This physical cue can help interrupt the commentary's flow and bring you back to the present moment.

Let's try it now. Inhale... inhale "I am here". Hold... exhale "yes". Hold... inhale "I am". (Note: Pinch the bridge of your nose as soon as you hear the commentary say "are you doing it right?")

We'll do another round.

Patient: I did the sequence — inhaled "I am here" (4), tiny pause, exhaled "yes", held, inhaled "I am", and when the internal commentator barked "are you doing it right?" I said "I'm here" and pinched the bridge of my nose. There was a momentary unclench — throat eased, shoulders drooped — but then shame and frustration flooded in hard and the commentator immediately rebranded it as avoidance or a performance failure. I'm irritated and embarrassed that even this became another thing to be judged; can we run another set and try a different on‑the‑spot phrase that feels less evaluative, maybe something like "not now" or a neutral word?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still trying to reframe your responses as performance metrics, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a neutral, non-evaluative phrase to help you stay with the presence, even when the commentary tries to reframe your response.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try using the word "pause". When the commentary says "are you doing it right?", I want you to respond with the word "pause". This neutral phrase can help you interrupt the commentary's flow and create a moment of stillness.

When the commentator re-frames "pause" as avoidance or a performance failure, I want you to gently wiggle your fingers. This subtle physical cue can help you stay with the physical sensations in your body and avoid getting caught up in metacognition.

Let's try it now. Inhale... inhale "I am here". Hold... exhale "yes". Hold... inhale "I am". (Note: Wait for the commentator to say "are you doing it right?")

Patient: I did it — inhaled "I am here," held, exhaled "yes," inhaled "I am," and when the commentator barked "are you doing it right?" I said "pause" and wiggled my fingers. There was a brief unclench — throat loosened, shoulders dropped — but then an old wave of shame and irritation slammed into me, and the commentator immediately recast it as avoidance or failure. I'm embarrassed and pissed that even this became another thing to be judged; can we run another round and tweak the cue (maybe a softer word or a different tiny movement) while you coach me step‑by‑step?

Therapist Answer:
Let's try using the word "rest". When the commentator says "are you doing it right?", I want you to respond with the word "rest". This softer phrase can help you create a sense of stillness and relaxation, without adding another layer of analysis.

When the commentator re-frames "rest" as avoidance or a performance failure, I want you to gently blink slowly. This subtle physical cue can help you stay with the physical sensations in your body and avoid getting caught up in metacognition.

There was that millisecond unclench — throat loosened, shoulders dropped — then an old wave of shame and frustration hit me hard, like all of that past incompetence energy got amplified, and the commentator immediately recast the whole thing as avoidance/failure. I'm irritated and embarrassed that even this became fodder for judgment; can we run another round right now with step‑by‑step coaching, and maybe swap the cue to something softer (like placing a hand over my sternum or a quiet hum) so it feels less evaluative?

It's clear that the commentary is still trying to reframe your responses as performance metrics, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a softer, more gentle cue that can help you stay with the presence, without adding another layer of analysis.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try using a gentle, non-verbal cue: placing a hand over your sternum. When the commentator says "are you doing it right?", I want you to place your hand over your sternum and stay there for a brief moment. This gentle, physical touch can help you stay grounded and centered, without adding another layer of evaluation.

When the commentator re-frames the experience as avoidance or failure, I want you to maintain the hand placement and focus on the physical sensation of the touch. Don't try to think about it, just be with the sensation of your hand on your sternum.

Let's try it now. Inhale... inhale "I am here". Hold... exhale "yes". Hold... inhale "I am". (Note: Wait for the commentator to say "are you doing it right?")

As soon as you hear the commentator say it, place your hand over your sternum and stay there for a brief moment. Let's see if we can create a sense of grounding and stay with the presence.

(Note: Remember, the goal is to stay with the physical sensations in your body, not to think about the commentary or evaluate your response.)

Patient: I placed my hand on my sternum like you said—there was a brief warmth and a tiny softening in my chest, my shoulders dipped a notch, and for about half a second I felt steadier. Then, almost instantly, that old shame rolled over me and the internal commentator relabeled it as failure, which makes me clamp down and start explaining instead of staying with it. I'm pissed and embarrassed that even this small grounding got turned into another performance metric; can we try another round slowly, step‑by‑step, and maybe use a quieter cue (a soft hum on the exhale) so it feels less like a thing to be judged?

It's clear that the commentary is still trying to reframe your experiences as performance metrics, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce an even softer cue, a quiet hum, to help you stay with the presence, without adding another layer of analysis or judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try using a soft hum on the exhale. When the commentator says "are you doing it right?", I want you to take a deep breath in, and then hum a very soft, gentle sound, almost like a quiet "mmmm". This subtle, non-verbal cue can help you create a sense of calm and relaxation, without adding another layer of evaluation.

When the commentator re-frames the experience as failure, I want you to continue humming, and don't try to stop or change it. Instead, let the hum be a constant, gentle presence in the background, like a gentle reminder to stay with the physical sensations in your body.

Let's try it now. Inhale... inhale "I am here". Hold... exhale softly, hum "mmmm". Hold... inhale "I am". (Note: Wait for the commentator to say "are you doing it right?")

As soon as you hear the commentator say it, take a deep breath in, and then hum "mmmm". Don't worry about the hum, just focus on the physical sensations in your body and the sound of the hum. Let's see if we can create a sense of calm and stay with the presence.

Patient: I did it — inhaled "I am here," hummed softly on the exhale, and there was a brief diaphragmatic loosening and my shoulders dropped a notch. Then an old wave of shame and frustration surged — the internal commentator immediately rebranded the hum as failure, and I felt that familiar hot shame rush and a tightening in my chest. I'm irritated and embarrassed by how fast it becomes another thing to be judged; can we run another guided set of five breaths with exact counts, and give me one neutral, non‑evaluative two‑word cue to say the instant the critic calls it avoidance (something that won't feed into performance anxiety)? I'm ready to try it now if you can coach me step‑by‑step.

Therapist Thinking:
It's clear that the commentary is still trying to reframe your experiences as performance metrics, and we need to develop a new strategy to interrupt its cycle. Goal: Introduce a new, neutral, two-word cue to help you stay with the presence, without adding another
