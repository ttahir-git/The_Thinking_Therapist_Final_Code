Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism—like I make one tiny mistake and my mind immediately decides I’ll get fired, my team will hate me, I’ll lose my apartment, and I’ll be completely alone, which is definitely how it’s going to go. Since I moved away from my main support system those stories are louder and I can't drown them out. It feels like my brain is a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster, and I’m totally hooked on the worst-case scenarios.

Therapist: What's one thing you'd be willing to do, even if it's just for a minute, to begin to quiet the voice that's telling you these catastrophic stories?

Patient: I guess I could try one minute of box breathing—inhale for 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4—just to see if it quiets the disaster-loop for a bit. Honestly, I’m skeptical it’ll do much; my brain will probably start yelling about how nothing will change and everything will fall apart as soon as I stop, but I can try it for a minute.

Therapist: Can you think of a reason why you might value taking small steps towards managing your thoughts, like box breathing, and what benefits those steps bring to you personally, even if it's just a sense of control or a brief break from the worst-case scenarios?

Patient: I guess one reason I'd value small steps is that even a minute of box breathing might give me a tiny break from the nonstop doom predictions and prove, for a moment, that I'm not actually falling apart right this second. It could give me a bit of control, calm my racing thoughts enough to avoid making harsh decisions or saying something I'll regret, and maybe slowly collect little proof that one mistake doesn't trigger the whole collapse. But honestly, I'm skeptical — my brain will tell me any calm is temporary and the disaster is still inevitably coming, so it feels unrealistic to expect big change from tiny steps.

Therapist: What would it mean to you to have proof that the calmness and sense of control that comes from box breathing isn't just temporary, but rather a sustainable response to your challenging thoughts?

Patient: It would mean I wasn't completely at the mercy of that fortune-telling voice — like I could actually catch myself before I spiral and not immediately assume I'm ruined. It would feel like getting back some control, being able to make decisions without panicking about losing my job, my apartment, or everyone I care about, and maybe even reaching out instead of shutting down. But honestly, I don't really believe it’ll stick — my brain's already saying any calm is just temporary and the disaster's still coming.

Therapist: Let's try to reframe the narrative around what happens when you do catch yourself before spiraling – what would it be like to pause the "disaster" and then, instead of assuming the worst, what if you started to consider alternative possibilities, even if they're not as catastrophic as your mind's initial predictions?

Patient: If I actually paused, maybe I could tell myself a mistake doesn't mean catastrophe — maybe my boss is annoyed but doesn't fire me, my team keeps working with me, and I don't lose my apartment overnight. But honestly that feels like wishful thinking; my brain already lays out the whole collapse, so those "maybe" outcomes seem totally unrealistic. I'm stuck with the certainty that the worst will happen, and picturing anything else just feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: Can you try noticing, without judgment, when you catch yourself picturing the worst-case scenario, and instead, gently ask yourself what the alternative possibilities are – what would it feel like to hold onto the "maybe" or "what if" aspect, even if it doesn't feel realistic?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it — when I catch the image of getting fired, losing my place, everyone leaving, there's this tighten-in-my-chest panic. If I try to hold the "maybe," it feels like a tiny, shaky loosening, like I can finally breathe for a second, but my brain is already yelling that it's fake and the collapse is still coming. I can try to stay with that "maybe" for a minute, but honestly I keep expecting it to snap back into the full disaster story.

Therapist: Let's try to introduce a sense of kindness and curiosity towards yourself as you try to stay with the "maybe." Instead of trying to make sense of or analyze the thoughts, what if you simply acknowledge them, as if you're a gentle observer, without judgment or attachment? Can you try to do that for just another minute, with the panic and tightening in your chest, without trying to push it away or analyze it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to stay with it for a minute. Right now my chest feels like a tight band, my heart's racing, and the images of getting fired and being alone keep popping up—I’m noticing them without pushing them away, and there’s a tiny loosening like I can breathe a bit, but my brain’s already yelling that it’s fake and the collapse is inevitable. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together and pause for a moment. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, noticing the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing in and out, noticing the cool air at the tip of my nose and my chest gently rising and falling. There's still this tight band in my chest and my mind keeps firing up the 'you're about to lose everything' movie, but right now the breath is steady enough that I can notice the panic without it swallowing me. I'm shaky and skeptical this will change anything long-term, but this tiny pause already feels like a small crack in the disaster story.

Therapist: What would it mean to you if you were to start small, just for a moment, to imagine a different outcome from the one your brain is predicting? Instead of assuming the worst, what if you started to imagine a more positive, less catastrophic outcome, just for a tiny fraction of a second?

Patient: If I let myself imagine a different outcome for even a split second, it would mean I’m not totally doomed—that maybe I can fix a mistake, my team still respects me, and life doesn’t immediately fall apart. But I don’t really believe it; my brain screams that’s fake and the whole disaster is still coming. I can try to hold that "maybe" for a moment, but honestly I’m feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down and take a moment to simply acknowledge the "screams" in your mind, without judgment. Can you say to yourself, "I see that my brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it?" Then, I'd like you to try a tiny, tiny step: imagine a single, tiny detail from the alternative scenario you started to imagine earlier – just one small thing, like "I'm still wearing the same clothes" – and hold onto it for just a tiny fraction of a second.

Patient: Okay: "I see that my brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." I picture one tiny detail — my coffee mug still on my desk — and hold it for a beat. My chest loosens a little, like a crack in the panic, but my brain's already shouting that it's temporary and the whole collapse is still coming. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's pause again and take a deep breath. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "my brain is yelling 'this is fake,'" and say it to yourself again, this time with a hint of kindness and curiosity: "My brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." Can you hold onto this phrase for just a moment, without judgment, and then gently ask yourself: what would it be like if you were to treat your brain's predictions with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to prove or disprove them?

Patient: "My brain is yelling 'this is fake,' and I'm going to let it be there, without trying to push it away or change it." 

If I treated the predictions with curiosity instead of trying to prove them, it might feel like stepping back from a runaway train—like I could look at each catastrophic thought and ask, "Is that really true?" which could make the panic less immediate and give me room to choose a calmer response. 

But honestly, I don't buy it — my brain's already screaming that it's a trick and the collapse is still definitely coming, and I'm starting to feel shaky and overwhelmed, so can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge that it's okay to feel shaky and overwhelmed. I'd like to ask you to imagine that you're standing near the edge of the "train track," and you're looking down at the tracks below. What would it feel like if you were to place one foot on the train track, rather than pushing it away or trying to prove or disprove the predictions? Can you just take a tiny step onto the track, without judgment or trying to change the outcome?

Patient: Okay, I can put one foot on the track — it feels insane, like I'm literally inviting the disaster to start. My heart's pounding and my brain's already yelling that this proves the collapse is inevitable, but the step is tiny and hesitant. I'm feeling really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the sensations in your body and the thoughts in your mind. Notice the pounding heart, the shaky legs, and the brain's warnings. Then, I'd like you to bring to mind a gentle, compassionate phrase: "I'm with you, no matter what." Can you say this phrase to yourself, even if you don't believe it, and simply allow it to be present in the moment, without judgment or attachment?

Patient: "I'm with you, no matter what." Saying it feels weird—my throat tightens and there's a tiny loosening in my chest, like maybe something could be different, but my brain's already yelling that it's a lie and the whole collapse is still coming. I'm really shaky—can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what." I'd like you to imagine that you're holding onto this phrase as a tiny anchor, and that it's allowing you to stay present with your feelings, even if your brain is trying to pull you away. Can you simply stay with this phrase, without trying to analyze it or change it, and instead, notice how it feels to be present with it, like a gentle breeze on a summer day?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try. Saying "I'm with you, no matter what" makes my chest and throat clench and this hot shame spikes up, like I already failed at even being kind to myself. For a beat it felt a little like a breeze, but my brain immediately screams that it’s fake and that gentleness won’t stop the collapse—that I’ll still mess up, get exposed, and everything will fall apart. I’m really overwhelmed—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and acknowledge the shame and self-doubt that's rising up. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what" again, but this time, I'd like you to say it to yourself with a sense of curiosity: "What would it be like if I were to approach this shame and self-doubt with kindness, rather than judgment or rejection?" Can you notice how the shame and self-doubt feel in your body, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: It’s this hot, shamey spike in my chest and a knot in my stomach, like I want to crawl into a hole, and my throat tightens whenever that voice starts saying I’m incompetent and everyone will see it. If I try to be curious about it, my brain just turns that curiosity into proof — saying that curiosity is denial and that the failure will definitely happen, I’ll get fired, lose my place, and be exposed — so imagining anything gentler feels fake and like lying to myself. I’m really shaky and frustrated right now—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge the overwhelming feeling of frustration and shame. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "I'm with you, no matter what" once more, but this time, I'd like you to say it to yourself with a sense of acceptance: "This shame, this self-doubt, it's here, and I'm acknowledging it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you simply allow the shame and self-doubt to be present, without trying to push them away or try to prove them wrong?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to let the shame and self-doubt just be here. There’s this hot spike in my chest, a knot in my stomach, and a pissed-off frustration that I always mess things up, and even as I notice it my brain's already narrating the whole collapse—I'll mess up, get fired, lose everything—so I'm skeptical this helps. I’m really shaky and overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of the shame and self-doubt in your body. I'd like you to notice the physical sensations without judgment, and simply say to yourself: "I'm here, I'm with the shame and self-doubt, and I'm going to allow it to be here, without trying to change it." Can you stay with this simple statement for a moment, without trying to add anything to it or change it?

Patient: I can try to stay with it — I'm saying to myself, "I'm here, I'm with the shame and self-doubt," and there's that hot shame in my chest, the knot in my stomach, my throat tightening like I always mess up. For a second it loosens a tiny bit, but my brain's already yelling that it's fake and the collapse is definitely coming — I'll mess up, get fired, lose everything. I'm really shaky and frustrated right now; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of the shame and self-doubt in your body. I'd like you to bring to mind the phrase "I'm here, I'm with the shame and self-doubt" again, and this time, I'd like you to say it with a sense of wonder: "What is this shame and self-doubt feeling like, exactly? What does it look, sound, feel like in my body?" Can you explore this question with curiosity, without trying to change or judge the shame and self-doubt?

Patient: It feels like a hot, red spike in my chest and a cold pit in my stomach, like a high, accusing whisper that keeps repeating "you're incompetent." When I look at it closely, it turns into this looping movie that proves I'll mess up, get fired, lose my apartment, and everyone will see I'm a failure — my brain treats that as an inevitable chain. I'm noticing my face flushes and I want to hide, and I'm really shaky and pissed off about feeling stuck—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your face flushing and the desire to hide. I'd like you to notice these sensations without judgment, and say to yourself: "This flushing, this feeling of wanting to hide, it's happening right now, and I'm going to observe it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you simply observe these sensations, without adding any thoughts or emotions to them?

Patient: I can feel the heat in my face, my cheeks burning and my heart picking up — there's this strong urge to duck away and hide. I'm trying to just notice it, but my brain immediately turns it into proof that I'm exposed and ruined — I'll be found out, fired, lose everything — and that shame flares so hard I can't stay neutral. I'm really shaky and pissed off that I can't observe this without it becoming a catastrophe — can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay that your brain is still trying to turn the sensations into catastrophic predictions. I'd like you to say to yourself: "I see that my brain is doing its thing, trying to make sense of these feelings, and I'm going to be kind to it, even if it's being unhelpful." Can you offer kindness to your brain, even if it's being painful or unhelpful, and allow it to continue to process these feelings without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. Saying something like, "I see you, you're scared and trying to protect me," feels weird and even gross, and that hot shame spikes like someone lit a match under my chest, but I can say it: I see you, brain — you're trying to keep me safe even if the way you're doing it is scary and unhelpful. It loosens a hair, but my brain's already yelling that it's fake and the whole collapse is still coming — I'm really shaky and pissed off; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your chest and the hot shame that's still present. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your heart beating faster and your breath coming in short gasps. Can you say to yourself: "I see my heart beating faster, and I'm going to allow it to keep beating, without trying to change it or judge it?" Can you simply observe this physical sensation, without adding any thoughts or emotions to it?

Patient: "I see my heart beating faster, and I'm going to allow it to keep beating, without trying to change it or judge it." My heart's pounding, my breath is shallow and my face is hot—I'm noticing it, but my brain immediately turns it into proof that I'm exposed and about to mess everything up: they'll see I'm incompetent, I'll get fired, lose my place, it's all definitely coming. I'm really shaky and ashamed and pissed off that I can't just observe this without it becoming a catastrophe—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a moment to acknowledge that it's okay to feel stuck and that it's okay to struggle. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your legs feeling heavy or weak, as if you're sinking into the ground. Can you say to yourself: "I see my legs feeling heavy, and I'm going to allow it, without trying to change it or judge it"? Can you simply observe this physical sensation, without adding any thoughts or emotions to it?

Patient: I can try. "I see my legs feeling heavy, and I'm going to allow it, without trying to change it or judge it." My legs feel like they're sinking and I want to bolt, but the shame spikes and my brain immediately turns it into proof that everyone will notice I'm failing, I'll get fired, lose my place, and be exposed — it's maddening. I'm really shaky and pissed off that I can't just observe this without it becoming a catastrophe—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on your legs sinking into the ground. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the ground beneath you, the feeling of being grounded and stable. Can you say to yourself: "I'm here, in this moment, with my legs sinking into the ground, and I'm going to allow it, without trying to change it or judge it"? Can you start to imagine that you're already in a safe place, where you can be with your shame and self-doubt without feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I try to imagine being in a safe place — feeling the ground under my feet and my legs steady — and for a second it loosens the tight band in my chest. But then this hot shame from that past failure spikes and my brain instantly starts the whole movie: they'll see I'm incompetent, I'll get fired, lose my place, I'm exposed — so the safe-place image just evaporates. I'm really shaky and pissed off that I can't stay here without the disaster taking over — can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your legs sinking into the ground. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and the feeling of your legs steady. Can you say to yourself: "I'm here, in this moment, with my legs sinking into the ground, and I'm going to allow both the shame and the sense of safety to be present, without trying to change or judge them"? Can you start to imagine that you're holding onto both the shame and the safe place, like two opposing forces, and that you can work with them together?

Patient: I can say it: "I'm here, in this moment, with my legs sinking into the ground, and I'm going to allow both the shame and the sense of safety to be present, without trying to change or judge them." Holding them feels like clutching a hot coal and a pillow at the same time—my legs steady for a beat, the shame still burning in my chest, and then my brain screams that the shame proves I'm exposed and everything will collapse. I'm really shaky and pissed off that I can't keep both without spiraling—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. I'd like you to notice the sensation of your heart beating, and say to yourself: "My heart is beating, and I'm going to allow it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you start to imagine that your heart is a small, delicate flame, and that the shame and safe place are two opposing forces that are not necessarily mutually exclusive? Can you imagine that you can allow both to be present, like two wings of a bird, supporting and lifting you up, rather than pulling you down?

Patient: Okay—I can try. I picture my heart as a small, fragile flame, and for a second I can imagine the shame and the safe place as two shaky wings holding me up, but then that hot shame spikes and my brain starts yelling that the flame will be snuffed and the wings will fail and I’ll be exposed and everything will collapse. I’m really shaky, my chest is tight, and I hate that my mind turns even this into proof—can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath and focus on the sensation of your chest tightening. I'd like you to notice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and say to yourself: "I'm feeling this tension in my chest, and I'm going to allow it, without trying to change it or judge it." Can you start to imagine that this tension is like a small, contained spark, and that it's not the same as the flames of shame and catastrophic thinking? Can you allow this spark to exist, without trying to snuff it out or make it go away?

Patient: I can sort of see it — a tiny, contained spark in my chest — but almost instantly my brain blows on it like wind and turns it into a wildfire that’ll prove I’m a failure and everything will collapse. My face is hot, I’m shaky, and that shame is right under everything, so I’m feeling really overwhelmed; can we slow down and sit with this a bit longer?
