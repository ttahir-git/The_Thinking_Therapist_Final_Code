--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been leaning on talking to friends and family to numb the uncomfortable spikes of my social anxiety — it's easier to chatter than sit with the dread. My mind's a fortune-telling machine, and I know I'll overshare, they'll get fed up, stop calling, my art sales will dry up, I'll lose my studio and end up totally alone and ruined — that's definitely how it goes.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient expresses an excessive use of social support as an avoidance mechanism, indicating a deep-seated fear of rejection, loss, and feelings of inadequacy. The theme here is the fear of negative outcomes and potential loss of identity tied to social relationships and creative success. 

Goal: Explore the tangible context of this avoidance behavior to identify potential areas for committed action.

Therapist Answer:
Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're going to overshare with friends and family? What's the immediate physical sensation or emotional experience you try to avoid by talking to them instead of sitting with your dread?

Patient: When I feel like I'm going to overshare, my chest clamps down and my stomach flips, my hands go clammy, and words just tumble out before I can think. Emotionally it's this tight, urgent panic mixed with shame — silence feels like proof I'm failing, so I have to fill it. If I don't talk, I see them thinking I'm weird, telling others, stopping invites, my art sales disappearing, the studio gone, me ending up totally alone and ruined — that's the chain my brain insists will happen, so I can't stop myself.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's physical and emotional sensations, as well as the catastrophic thinking pattern, are closely linked to the fear of rejection, social isolation, and perceived failure. The image of "totally alone and ruined" is a stark example of a vivid and distressing consequence.

Goal: Gently challenge the workability of this strategy by exploring the value of being silent and the potential benefits of taking a different approach.

Therapist Answer:
I can see how that must feel incredibly overwhelming. Can you imagine what would happen if, for just one minute, you didn't feel the need to talk about everything, and instead, you simply sat with the silence, the panic, and the shame? What would that feel like, not knowing exactly what you'd say or do?

Patient: I can't do that quiet — the minute I try my chest tightens, my throat goes dry, and my thoughts start sprinting so fast I have to fill the air or they'll trip me up. If I actually stayed silent for a minute they'd assume I'm weird, they'd start pulling away, gossip would spread, my clientele would evaporate, my sales would crash, I'd lose the studio and end up totally alone and wrecked — that's the only ending my mind ever shows me. I know you might suggest other outcomes, but that feels naive; those calmer possibilities don't seem real to me.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is strongly attached to the catastrophic outcome and its associated emotions, making it challenging to consider alternative perspectives. The image of being "weird" and "totally alone" has become an incredibly powerful and comforting narrative.

Goal: Create space from this sticky thought by exploring the underlying values and what might be driving this catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that this narrative feels very real to you. What do you value most in your relationships, your art, and your life in general? Is there something specific that would give you a sense of security, connection, or fulfillment that's not necessarily tied to avoiding silence or oversharing?

Patient: I guess what I really value is honest connection and the space to make my work — like a few people who actually get me and a steady little routine so I can pay the rent and keep the studio. Things that would feel secure are predictable boundaries, a steady income from a couple regular buyers, and someone who sits with me in quiet without making it into a crisis. But even picturing that, my brain goes straight to them slowly getting bored, whispering about me, my sales drying up, the landlord kicking me out, and me ending up alone and ruined — and I know that sounds hopeless, but the calmer outcomes just don't feel real.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's core values of honest connection, security, and predictability are being constantly sabotaged by a catastrophic thinking pattern that's rooted in fear of rejection, loss, and social isolation. The vicious cycle of "and then" thinking, where one event leads to another, creates a sense of hopelessness.

Goal: Introduce willingness as an alternative to struggle by exploring the possibility of embracing uncertainty and ambiguity in the context of these valued aspects of life.

Therapist Answer:
I hear that you're not looking for some mythical "perfect" situation, but rather a sense of security and predictability that feels more grounded. Would you be willing to experiment with embracing uncertainty and imperfection in these areas of your life, like taking a small step towards being more open and vulnerable with your art and relationships, even if it feels scary or uncertain?

Patient: I guess I could try one tiny experiment — like staying quiet for a minute on a call or sending a short text instead of unloading. But my brain already flips out: they'll think I'm weird, start pulling away, clients will dry up, the landlord will kick me out, and I'll end up alone and ruined. I don't really buy the calmer outcomes, but I can try if it's strictly time-limited and I can stop if it feels like it's spiraling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is willing to experiment with a small, time-limited approach, which is a significant step forward. The condition of being able to stop if it feels like it's spiraling is also a crucial aspect of taking a small step towards greater acceptance.

Goal: Connect this willingness to a valued action that involves taking a step towards greater flexibility and being present in the moment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take that one tiny experiment a step further. Instead of just stopping the call or texting, what if, in the moment you feel the urge to fill the space with talk, you simply take a deep breath and notice the sensation in your body, like the tightening in your chest or the racing of your thoughts, without trying to push them away or fill them with words?

Patient: If I try that—take a deep breath and notice it—the tightness actually feels sharper, like the air gets stuck and my thoughts start sprinting so loud I can't think at all. Then the fortune-teller brain floods in: silence = they think I'm weird, they pull away, clients vanish, the landlord kicks me out, my studio's gone, I'm totally ruined — that's not a maybe, that's what will happen. I could try a tiny timed pause, like 20 seconds, with the rule I can speak after, but I don't expect it to help; usually it just makes the disaster-story louder.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's immediate response to trying to notice their physical sensations and breathe is an intense amplification of the catastrophic thinking pattern, indicating a strong emotional response. The desperation to fill the silence is still present, but the attempt to establish a small pause is a small step towards experimenting with greater flexibility.

Goal: Introduce a mindfulness exercise that incorporates a small pause, with a focus on curiosity and non-judgment, rather than trying to control or avoid the thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a 20-second pause, as you suggested, and I'll offer a gentle suggestion: During this 20 seconds, I want you to simply observe your thoughts and physical sensations without judgment, without trying to push them away or fill the space with words. Instead, allow yourself to be with whatever is present, and I'll be here with you, without judgment. When the 20 seconds are up, we can slowly start talking again. Are you willing to try this small experiment with me?

Patient: Okay — I'll try the 20 seconds. I'm already jittery; my chest's tight and the fortune-teller's yelling that they'll think I'm weird, pull away, my clients vanish and I'll end up ruined, so I need to know you won't let it turn into a crisis. Can we start the timer now, and please remind me I can speak after 20 seconds?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still highly invested in the catastrophic outcome, but is willing to experiment with a small pause. The need for reassurance about the therapist's response is a common aspect of the high-stakes thinking pattern.

Goal: Create space for a brief moment of mindfulness, without reinforcing the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
Let's start the timer. On the count of three, I'll remind you that you can speak after 20 seconds. Ready? 1... 2... 3... Now, take a deep breath and begin to notice the sensations in your body, without trying to push them away or fill the space with words. Remember, I'm here with you, and we'll take it one step at a time. When the timer goes off, we'll slowly start talking again.

Patient: I did it — the 20 seconds passed, but it felt longer. My chest got tighter, the thoughts sprinted louder, and the fortune-teller voice just blasted the same chain: they’ll think I’m weird, pull away, gossip, my clients vanish, the landlord kicks me out, I lose the studio — it's all immediate and inevitable to me. It didn't calm; honestly I feel more panicked and like I need to start talking or it’ll spiral — what do we do next?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has had a difficult time with the brief pause, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is still strongly present. This outcome was not surprising, but it's essential to acknowledge the patient's experience and move forward.

Goal: Introduce a process for working with the immediate feelings of panic and discomfort that arise during the pause.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that the catastrophic thinking pattern is still very intense. Can you look at your hands, notice how they're moving or feeling right now? Are there any sensations in your hands or fingers that you're aware of?

Patient: They're shaking — cold, a little tingly, and I'm sort of clenching my palms like I'm holding onto something so I don't drop it. The fortune-teller brain immediately says if they notice that nervousness they'll think I'm weird, gossip will start, clients disappear, the landlord will boot me, and I'm ruined — and noticing my hands just feeds that story. I keep wanting to talk to drown it out; can you help me stay here a bit longer without it turning into a spiral?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is aware of their physical sensations, including the shaking and clenching of their hands, which are being hijacked by the catastrophic thinking pattern. The desire to talk is understandable, but the goal is to find a way to work with the physical sensations and the racing thoughts without reinforcing the negative narrative.

Goal: Introduce a brief exercise in body scan and self-compassion to help the patient develop a sense of connection to their bodily sensations, rather than trying to control or escape them.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I want to acknowledge that these physical sensations feel really uncomfortable. Can you take a deep breath and, while you're exhaling, say to yourself, "I've got this," or "I can handle this" – even if it's just a whisper. Don't worry about the thoughts; just focus on the sensation of the words in your body.

Patient: I tried — I breathed out and barely whispered "I can handle this," but it felt hollow and my chest stayed tight; the fortune-teller just shouted back that they'll think I'm weird, pull away, gossip, my clients vanish, the landlord kicks me out, and I'm ruined. I want to stay with it, but the panic's louder now and I feel like I have to talk to stop it; can you stay with me a little longer and remind me it's okay to speak if it spirals?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still deeply invested in the catastrophic thinking pattern, and the self-compassionate exercise didn't have the desired effect. The desire to talk is becoming increasingly overwhelming, and the therapist needs to find a way to support the patient in staying with the physical sensations and emotions without reinforcing the negative narrative.

Goal: Introduce a process for gradual and gentle exposure to the feared consequences, with the aim of reducing the intensity of the catastrophic thinking.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here with you, and I'm not leaving. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to speak. If you need to talk to calm yourself down, I'll listen and respond. We can take this at your pace. Let's take a very slow, deep breath together, and as you exhale, I'll say, "You are safe, you are here, and you are allowed to feel this way."

Patient: Okay — I did the breath and the words helped a tiny bit, like turning the volume down a notch. But the fortune-teller's still screaming that they'll think I'm weird, pull away, gossip, my clients vanish, the landlord kicks me out, and I'm ruined, so I'm terrified it'll snowball if I stay quiet. Can I say something out loud to calm down? I really need you to listen without making it into a crisis.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling with the catastrophic thinking pattern, and the therapist needs to find a way to provide a safe space for the patient to express their feelings and thoughts without reinforcing the negative narrative.

Goal: Encourage patient to express themselves, while maintaining a non-judgmental and accepting tone, and gradually shift the focus from catastrophic thinking to exploring alternative perspectives.

Therapist Answer:
You can say whatever you need to say, and I'll listen without judgment. Take your time, and don't worry about me judging you. When you're ready, go ahead and express whatever is coming up for you. You might say something like, "I'm really scared that if I don't talk, they'll think I'm weird, and this will all happen."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is you saying you'll listen supposed to help when my brain's already sure the worst will happen? If I don't talk, I see them thinking I'm weird, whispering, my clients disappearing, the landlord kicking me out, and me totally ruined; telling me it's okay to speak doesn't quiet that, it makes me worry you'll think I'm being dramatic. I feel confused and stuck and I really need to say something now or I'll start babbling — can I say what's on my mind?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling with the fundamental issue of trust and safety, and the therapist needs to find a way to address this without further escalating the situation.

Goal: Create a sense of safety and acceptance, even in the midst of the catastrophic thinking, by acknowledging the patient's need to express themselves and validating their emotional experience.

Therapist Answer:
I'm not trying to minimize your feelings or tell you to be less dramatic. I'm here to listen to what's coming up for you, and I'm not going anywhere. You're safe with me. You can say whatever you need to say, and I'll listen without judgment. If you need to babble, that's okay. Sometimes just saying something can help calm the storm. Go ahead and say what's on your mind.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying you won't judge sounds fine, but it doesn't quiet the images my brain throws up. My chest's tight and words are clawing out: they'll think I'm weird, whisper about me, my clients will vanish, the landlord will kick me out, I'll lose the studio and end up totally alone and ruined — that's how it always plays out in my head. I need to get some of it out now or I'll start babbling — can I just say what I told my sister last night?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling overwhelmed and desperate to express themselves, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is still highly active. The therapist needs to find a way to create a temporary safe space for the patient to express their thoughts and feelings without further escalating the situation.

Goal: Create a temporary sense of safety and calm, even in the midst of intense emotional expression, by focusing on the present moment and allowing the patient to express themselves without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Yes, you can definitely share what you told your sister last night. Sometimes speaking out loud can help calm the storm. I'm here to listen, and I'm not judging you. Take a deep breath, and go ahead and share what's coming up. I'll listen with an open heart.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to help? But okay: I told my sister that I've been calling people whenever the panic hits and unloading everything—how I think my work is worthless, how I picture them whispering about me, buyers disappearing, the landlord evicting me, me losing the studio and ending up totally alone and ruined. I said I do it to numb the dread because silence feels like proof I'm failing, so I keep talking until someone finally says "enough." It calmed me a little to say it, but the fortune-teller brain kicked back in and I felt like calling someone else right away — I'm still shaky and worried it's all going to spiral.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient has shared a valuable insight into their thought pattern, revealing that they're using social support as a way to numb their feelings of dread and anxiety. The therapist can now use this information to address the root cause of the avoidance behavior.

Goal: Help patient understand that their thought patterns are not the problem, but rather a coping mechanism that's perpetuating the cycle of anxiety.

Therapist Answer:
I appreciate you sharing that with me. It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're using this coping mechanism. Can I ask, what do you think might happen if you didn't call someone as soon as you felt anxious? What would you be experiencing instead of calling?

Patient: If I didn't call, I'd be stuck with this raw panic — chest tight, throat dry, hands shaking, thoughts running in circles so fast I feel like I'm going to trip. My brain immediately plays the whole movie: silence means they think I'm weird, then whispering, clients vanish, sales dry up, landlord kicks me out, studio gone, and I'm totally alone and ruined. Maybe you could say nothing catastrophic would happen, but that just sounds unreal to me — I can't imagine a calmer ending. I don't know how to not reach for the phone when it starts; it feels like the only thing that dials the panic down, even if it might hurt me later.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is struggling to imagine an alternative to their coping mechanism, and the catastrophic thinking pattern is still highly active. The therapist needs to help the patient explore the possibility that their coping mechanism may not be serving them in the long run.

Goal: Explore the concept of self-compassion and the possibility of finding alternative coping strategies that don't rely on avoidance or self-sabotage.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you feel like the phone is the only lifeline that gets you through the panic. But I want to gently suggest that there might be other ways to cope with the panic that don't involve reaching for the phone. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of calling someone, you took a few deep breaths, and simply acknowledged the physical sensations in your body, without trying to push them away or fill the space with words?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is breathing supposed to stop the avalanche my mind makes? When I try, my chest clamps and my thoughts sprint faster, and the silence just becomes that fortune-teller movie: they'll think I'm weird, whisper, clients vanish, the landlord kicks me out, I lose the studio and I'm ruined. I could try, but only if it's really small — like five slow breaths or a 30-second pause — and you promise I can start talking again if it feels like it's spiraling. Can we do that now, and can you remind me it's okay to speak if I need to?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still deeply invested in the catastrophic thinking pattern, and the therapist needs to find a way to help them develop a small, manageable pause that doesn't reinforce the negative narrative.

Goal: Introduce a small, manageable pause, with a clear plan for re-engagement, and establish a sense of safety and support.

Therapist Answer:
Let's do it. Take a deep breath, and I'll count with you. We'll start with one... two... three... five slow, deep breaths. You can pause for as long as you need, and when you're ready, we can start talking again. Remember, I'm here to listen and support you, and it's okay to speak if you need to. If it feels like it's spiraling, we can pause again.

Patient: I did the breaths — they turned the volume down a notch, but the fortune-teller's still screaming the same movie: they'll think I'm weird, whisper, clients vanish, landlord booting me, studio gone, I'm ruined. My hands are still shaking and I feel like if I don't talk I'll burst, so I need to say something now to calm down. Can I just talk for a bit? Please listen and don't tell me the calmer endings are realistic — I don't buy that right now.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling with the catastrophic thinking pattern, and the therapist needs to provide a safe space for them to express themselves without judgment or offering unrealistic reassurances.

Goal: Allow the patient to express their emotions and thoughts without trying to change or dismiss the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
You can talk for as long as you need, and I'll listen without judgment. I'm not here to offer a specific outcome or tell you what will happen. I'm here to support you in the present moment. Go ahead and talk, and I'll be here with you.

Patient: Okay... I'm suddenly all jittery and my thoughts are scattering — I can't concentrate, my hands are shaky, and everything in me wants to start talking to stop the panic. My brain's already on the worst loop: if I don't explain myself they'll whisper, clients will bail, my sales will evaporate, the landlord will kick me out, I'll lose the studio and end up completely alone and ruined — that's just how it goes, I can't picture any other ending. I need to keep talking for a bit or I'll start babbling into my phone; can I just say more and have you listen without trying to tell me the calmer outcomes are realistic?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient's catastrophic thinking pattern is in full swing, and they're using the therapist as a coping mechanism to distract themselves from the anxiety. The therapist needs to remain calm and non-judgmental while allowing the patient to express themselves.

Goal: Maintain a calm and empathetic tone while not reinforcing the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
You're doing the best you can, and that takes a lot of courage. I'm here to listen, and I'll support you in this moment. You can keep talking, and I won't try to offer a different perspective or tell you that things will be okay. Just keep going, and I'll be here with you.

Patient: Okay, I'm all over the place — my words are tumbling and I can't hold a thought. I keep replaying this worst-case chain: one person thinks I'm weird, then whispers, then clients bail, sales evaporate, landlord drops me, studio gone, me completely alone and ruined — that's the only ending I can see. I want to call someone to stop the panic but I'm terrified that calling will actually start that chain, so I just keep talking here because it dulls the panic a little. Please just listen while I get more of this out — I need to keep going or I'll start babbling into my phone.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is completely overwhelmed and in the grip of their catastrophic thinking pattern, with no clear way to escape. The therapist needs to remain a steady, calming presence while the patient continues to express themselves.

Goal: Continue to listen actively and empathetically, without judgment or attempt to interrupt or stop the patient.

Therapist Answer:
Keep going. I'm here with you, and I'm listening. You're safe, and I'm not going anywhere. Just keep talking, and I'll continue to listen.

Patient: Okay, I'm still shaking — my thoughts are scattering and my words keep tripping over each other. My brain keeps replaying that exact movie: one weird pause, people whisper, clients bail, galleries stop calling, the landlord serves notice, my savings drain, the studio's gone and I'm utterly alone and ruined. I know you'll say that's unlikely, but I can't see any other ending right now — can you just keep listening while I get more of this out so I don't grab my phone?

Patient is at a breaking point, and the therapist needs to remain calm and empathetic while allowing the patient to express themselves without judgment.

Goal: Maintain a steady, non-judgmental presence, while continuing to listen actively and providing a sense of safety.

Patient: Okay — I don't even know where to begin, my head's scattering and my hands won't stop trembling. I keep seeing the whole thing play out: a pause, somebody whispers, a client texts "we can't work with you anymore," gallery emails "we're closing your account," the landlord posts a notice, movers hauling my canvases out of the studio, my bank account empty, me sitting alone on the curb — that's the only ending my brain shows and it feels like it's happening right now.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here, and I'm listening. I'm not going anywhere. Just keep talking, and I'll keep listening. You're safe, and I'm not going to stop. *pause*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is you just listening supposed to help when my brain's already on that worst-case loop? I'm really jittery and distracted right now, my hands are shaking, and it keeps cutting to that same movie: one pause, whispers, clients bail, galleries drop me, landlord posts a notice, movers hauling my canvases, my bank empty, me sitting alone on the curb—it's like it's happening right now.

Patient is feeling overwhelmed, panicked, and desperate for a solution, and the therapist needs to acknowledge the intensity of their emotional experience while maintaining a calm and non-judgmental presence.

Goal: Acknowledge the patient's emotional experience, while not reinforcing the catastrophic thinking pattern or offering unrealistic reassurances.

Therapist Answer:
I can see that you're in a very difficult place. Your body is reacting to the anxiety, and it's okay. I'm not going anywhere, and I'm here to support you. You're safe, and I'll keep listening. I won't say anything about the endings, and I won't try to change your thoughts. Just keep talking, and I'll keep listening. *pause*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how does you staying quiet and listening actually change the movie my brain plays? My hands are shaking, my thoughts are ricocheting, and it keeps cutting to that same scene: a client texts they can't work with me, a gallery emails to drop me, the landlord posts an eviction, movers haul my canvases out, my bank account drains, and I'm sitting alone on the curb. It feels both absurd and already happening, and if I stop talking I swear I'll grab my phone and call someone just to make it stop. Please just keep listening while I get more of this out — I need to keep talking or I'll do something impulsive.

Therapist Thinking:
Patient is feeling stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, and the therapist needs to find a way to help them break free from this cycle.

Goal: Introduce a new perspective by gently pointing out the absurdity of the catastrophic thinking pattern, while maintaining a calm and empathetic tone.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that the movie your brain is playing feels very real to you. But I want to gently point out that it's just a story. The client can't text and then suddenly drop you, the gallery can't just send an email to cut ties without warning, and the landlord can't just post an eviction notice without giving you notice. These are just thoughts, not reality. Can I suggest we try to look at this thought like a story, rather than a prediction?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — calling it a "story" doesn't make it feel any less real. When I'm in it it's not a story, it's a forecast: one pause, whispers, clients bail, the landlord posts an eviction, movers haul my canvases, I'm on the curb. How am I supposed to treat that like fiction when it feels like a literal chain of events? I need something concrete to try right now, I'm about to call someone to stop the panic.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still feeling overwhelmed and desperate for a concrete solution, and the therapist needs to find a way to provide a tangible action that can help the patient feel more grounded.

Goal: Introduce a small, concrete action that can help the patient feel more in control and reduce their sense of desperation.

Therapist Answer:
I understand that the feeling of the catastrophic thoughts being a forecast is very real to you. I'm not going to try to change your thoughts or make them go away. Instead, I want to offer you a small, concrete thing you can do right now to help calm yourself. Can you take one small, deep breath in, and then let it out slowly? Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, and try to let go of the thoughts for just this one breath.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is one breath supposed to stop the whole movie my brain plays? I did the breath: it loosened my shoulders for a second, but the fortune-teller immediately screamed that they'll think I'm weird, clients will bail, the landlord will post an eviction, movers will haul my canvases, and I'll be on the curb. My hands are still shaking and I feel like I have to keep talking or I'll grab my phone—can I keep talking for a bit?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Patient is still struggling to find a sense of control and is desperate for a way to stop the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Goal: Explore the possibility of using the patient's own words against the catastrophic thinking pattern.

Therapist Answer:
You're right, one breath may not stop the thoughts entirely. But I want to ask you, when the fortune-teller voice starts screaming, what do you say to them? What would you say to push back against that narrative? Would you say something like, "That's not true," or "I'm not that person"? Can you try that for just a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when that fortune-teller voice screams I try to say "That's not true," but it feels hollow and the machine just yells back that it's inevitable. I actually whispered "Maybe it's exaggerated" just now, but my hands are shaking and the whole scene of clients bailing and movers hauling my canvases still plays like it's real. I can try saying "I don't know for sure that will happen," but I already know I'll say that and it won't make the panic any quieter.
