Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this recursive loop of harsh self-evaluation—every minor setback gets reinterpreted as a categorical failure, which feels intensified by being unemployed and dealing with the empty nest. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved family, so my default is to intellectualize and elaborate theories about my feelings instead of actually feeling them, which I guess makes the self-criticism more persistent. Outwardly I'm adaptable and impulsive at times, but underneath there's this analytical detachment that keeps me from accessing the sadness or fear that might actually need attention.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you're stuck in this loop of self-criticism? What's the first thing that comes up for you when you think about those moments, and what do you think is driving that self-evaluation?

Patient: When it starts, the immediate thing is this rapid internal narrative that reinterprets a small mistake as categorical evidence I'm incompetent — a sort of cognitive tautology where the conclusion is assumed in the premise. I think what's driving it is a mix of an emotionally reserved upbringing that taught me approval had to be inferred rather than felt, plus the loss of roles from unemployment and the empty nest that used to anchor my self-worth, so there's more space for catastrophizing and comparative judgments. I mostly respond by mapping and theorizing those patterns — metacognitive analysis feels safer than actually sitting with the shame or fear that I suspect is underneath.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the role of metacognitive analysis in your self-criticism. Can you think of a situation where you've successfully used this analytical approach to process a difficult emotion or situation? What would it be like for you to approach a similar situation without the need for such a detailed analysis, and instead, simply being present with the emotions that arise?

Patient: One time that actually worked was after a harsh performance review a few years back — I did a structured cognitive mapping, isolated the automatic thought (“I’m incompetent”), tested it against evidence, and used that to reframe the narrative enough to take concrete steps (training, small wins) instead of spiraling. Approaching that same scenario without the scaffolding of analysis would mean trying to inhabit the raw sensations — the tightness in my chest, the hollow ache — and naming them simply as sadness or fear, which feels strangely both vulnerable and unmoored. I’m not sure I can sustain that kind of feeling-focused approach because I was raised to intellectualize; it’s appealing in theory but also pretty terrifying in practice.

Therapist: It's understandable to feel apprehensive about inhabiting emotional experiences without the safety net of analysis. Can you think of a small, everyday situation where you're already experiencing emotions, like when you're waiting in line or listening to music that evokes a certain mood? What would happen if you allowed yourself to simply acknowledge those emotions without trying to intellectualize them, without needing to label them or change them?

Patient: If I actually let myself notice, the first thing would be a tightness in my chest and a low, persistent agitation, and then my mind would almost immediately start drafting explanatory narratives to contain or neutralize it. Paradoxically, I think if I stayed with that raw sensation instead of inventing reasons for it the intensity would probably dissipate — maybe a few tears, a weird, heavy fatigue — but that feels destabilizing and frankly scary. So I default to meta-analysis because it gives a semblance of control, even though I can see, in theory, that tolerating the feeling might actually be healthier.

Therapist: The thought of simply allowing yourself to experience the sensation without trying to control it can feel overwhelming. What if, instead of trying to control or analyze the feeling, you simply observe it as it arises, without judgment or expectation? Would you be willing to try sitting with this sensation for just a few breaths, allowing yourself to notice it without trying to change it, and see what happens?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that—breathing in, out, a few slow breaths. There's a tight, heavy pressure in my chest and a kind of low, restless buzz in my head, and already my mind wants to file this away as "evidence" of some failure instead of just feeling it. I can tell this is uncomfortable and I'm likely to start analyzing to avoid it—could you help keep me with the sensation if I begin to drift?

Therapist: Notice the sensations in your body, the pressure in your chest and the buzz in your head. Imagine that you're a compassionate friend, and you're simply noticing the sensations for the sake of noticing them. No judgment, no analysis, just a gentle curiosity. You might say to yourself, "I'm here with this sensation, and it's okay to be with it." Can you stay with the sensation for just a little longer, without trying to label it or change it, and see what happens?

Patient: I did—maybe for half a minute. The tightness spread into a dull, steady ache and my breathing actually eased a little, and for a moment there was this faint warmth behind my eyes that felt like sadness, but then my brain kicked into overdrive, cataloguing explanations and turning it into evidence of failure. I notice the reflexive metacognitive defense—analyzing feels safer than being unmoored—but that also keeps me from knowing what the feeling actually is. Could you prompt me gently—like asking what the chest feels like right now—so I don’t drift into explaining it away?

Therapist: Can you describe the sensation in your chest right now, without trying to label it or analyze it? Just notice the physical feeling, the texture, the location, the sensation of it in relation to your body. What's the sensation like, exactly?

Patient: It's a tight, band-like pressure just under my breastbone—a dull, heavy ache that makes my breaths feel a bit shallower. There's a faint warmness behind my ribs and an occasional small flutter, like something trying to move but held in place; my shoulders feel slightly tense too. I'm aware my mind wants to explain it, but I'm trying to stick to the raw sensations.

Therapist: Notice the physical sensations in your body, especially the tightness in your chest. Can you imagine that this sensation is not trying to be understood or analyzed, but simply is, like a physical presence in your body? What would happen if you allowed this sensation to be exactly as it is, without trying to change it or make sense of it?

Patient: If I allow it to be, the band-like pressure inches toward a softer, more diffuse ache and there's a warmth behind my eyes like sadness trying to assert itself, which is both oddly clarifying and frightening. Immediately my mind generates a protective narrative—if I feel this I'll disintegrate—so I half-succeed at observing and half-wrench myself back into analysis. I suspect staying with it longer would let the intensity ebb into something quieter, maybe a hollow steadiness or a few tears, but the prospect of being that vulnerable feels destabilizing. Can you keep guiding me to notice the chest and breath so I don't slide into explaining it away?

Therapist: Let's come back to the sensation in your chest. Notice the physical sensation of the band-like pressure, the softening and diffusing of the ache, and the warmth behind your eyes. Can you bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, specifically the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? Try to focus on the sensation of the breath, without trying to change it or analyze it, just notice it as it is.

Patient: The breath is shallow and cool at my nostrils, my ribs barely expanding because of that banded pressure—each in-breath feels like a small incursion and the out-breath a slight release. Almost immediately my mind wants to narrativize—"this is anxiety," "this means you're failing"—which blunts the actual sensation, so focusing on the breath calms me but only fleetingly. Could you keep nudging me back to the bodily sensation if I start turning it into another theory?

Therapist: Let's gently bring our attention back to the sensation in your chest. Notice the way your ribs are barely expanding, and the sensation of the in-breath as a small incursion, and the out-breath as a slight release. Try to focus on the sensation of the physical movement of the breath, without trying to make sense of it or label it. Can you simply notice the sensation of your chest, as it is, without trying to relate it to anything else?

Patient: The band is still there but a bit softer now—my ribs lift a fraction more, so each breath feels like a shallow tide rather than a pinprick. There's a warm, diffuse pressure behind my sternum and a faint quiver under my left ribs; my shoulders have eased a notch. My mind's already busily reinterpreting—"this is anxiety, this proves you're failing"—so I could use your gentle reminders to keep me anchored in the sensation rather than spiraling into explanation.

Therapist: Notice the sensations in your chest, the band, the warm pressure, and the quiver under your ribs. Let's take a moment to acknowledge the sensation of your mind's interpretation, without judgment. You're already aware of the thought pattern, "this is anxiety, this proves you're failing." Can you simply acknowledge that thought, without taking it on as your identity?

Patient: I can notice the thought—"this is anxiety, this proves you're failing"—as a passing mental event rather than an absolute verdict, and that small decentering helps a bit. Still, there's this hot, stinging shame that floods my chest and fuels a surge of frustration, and it immediately wants me to recoil into analysis because thinking feels safer than feeling. I can hold it as "just a thought" if you keep nudging me back to the breath when that shame spikes.

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the shame and frustration in your chest, but try not to engage with it directly. Instead, bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, specifically the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you breathe, allow yourself to simply exist with the sensations in your chest, without trying to change them or analyze them. When the shame spikes, I'll gently nudge you back to the breath, and we can try to ride the wave of feeling together. Can you take one more deep breath with me?

Patient: Okay—breathing in, out. The inhale lets my ribs lift a little more and for a second the band loosens, but then a sudden flash hits and this hot, stinging shame floods my chest and makes me tense and oddly furious at myself. My metacognitive reflex is kicking in hard—already trying to rationalize and catalogue the feeling instead of sitting with it—so I need you to keep nudging me back to the breath when I start explaining it away. Can you do that?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the shame and fury in your chest, but try not to engage with it directly. Bring your attention to the sensation of your breath, specifically the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you breathe, allow yourself to simply exist with the sensations in your chest, without trying to change them or analyze them. When you start to rationalize or catalogue the feeling, gently remind yourself to come back to the breath. Take one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to settle back into the sensation of the chest, without trying to make sense of it.

Patient: Exhaling now—the ribs drop and for a second the band loosens, but then that hot shame surges and I feel this sharp, self-directed anger that immediately starts to turn the experience into evidence I'm defective. I'm trying to rest in the breath—the cool in, the warm out—but my head already wants to make a case for whatever this means, which just makes me more frustrated. Can you keep nudging me back to the breath when I start arguing with the feeling?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the anger and frustration in your chest, but try not to engage with it directly. Bring your attention to the sensation of the breath, specifically the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. As you breathe, allow yourself to simply exist with the sensations in your chest, without trying to change them or analyze them. When you start to argue with the feeling, gently remind yourself that you're not trying to convince yourself of anything, just to notice the sensation as it is. Take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently ask yourself: "What happens if I simply let this feeling be, without trying to make sense of it?"

Patient: If I actually let it be, my body tends to do what you said—the band loosens a bit, the ache spreads into a warm, tear-prone fatigue, and after a minute or two the intensity usually attenuates into a quieter hollow. But the shame hits like a hot spike and I get furious at myself—like feeling anything is evidence I'm weak or incompetent—so my mind immediately starts rehearsing explanations to shove it back in a box. Can you keep nudging me to the breath and maybe time thirty more seconds with me, gently calling me out if I start rationalizing? I'm scared I'll fall apart if I don't analyze it, but I also want to know what's under the anger.

Therapist: Let's stay with the breath, noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. When the shame and anger spike, I'll gently nudge you back to the breath. I want you to know that it's okay to feel overwhelmed and scared, but it's also okay to allow yourself to feel. Let's try to stay with the sensation for just a bit longer, thirty seconds. As you breathe, I'll remind you to simply notice the sensations in your body, without trying to change them or analyze them.

Notice the sensation of your chest, and bring your attention to the sensation of your breath. Allow yourself to exist with the sensations, without trying to make sense of them. If your mind starts to rationalize or analyze, I'll gently remind you to come back to the breath. Just breathe in, and as you exhale, allow yourself to settle into the sensation of the chest, without judgment. We're here to support you, and it's okay to take your time.

Patient: I'm trying to follow, but I'm not sure I follow—how is just sitting with the breath for thirty seconds supposed to stop the shame from detonating into analysis? Right now a hot sting of shame is flooding my chest and I get confused and defensive and immediately start arguing with the feeling. Could you actually count the seconds or gently say "back to the breath" when I start rationalizing? I need that concrete anchor because otherwise I slip into making a case for myself.

Therapist: I'll make sure to provide clear cues to help you stay with the breath. Let's try again, and I'll count out loud. When you start to feel the shame rising, I'll say "Back to the breath." You can start by focusing on the sensation of your breath, and I'll guide you through the next few seconds. Ready? Inhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... Your chest feels... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10...

Patient: During the count I could feel my ribs lift for the first few numbers, but right around five that hot, stinging shame surged and my head immediately started drafting a defense—cataloguing, explaining, trying to turn it into evidence. I'm not sure I follow how counting by itself is supposed to short-circuit that analytic reflex—I can articulate the theory (grounding interrupts rumination), but the lived experience is different and I get confused and defensive. Could you actually say "Back to the breath" when you hear me start rationalizing, and maybe count more slowly while prompting me—I'm afraid if you don't I'll tumble into argument and lose the sensation again.

Therapist: Let's try again, and I'll provide clear cues to help you stay with the breath. When you start to feel the shame rising, I'll say "Back to the breath" in a calm and gentle tone. I'll also count more slowly to help you stay with the moment. Ready? Inhale... 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) Your chest feels... (pause) 5... (pause) Can you stay with the sensation of your breath as I count?

Patient: I'm trying to follow—the ribs lift through 1–3, but just as you hit 4 that hot sting of shame spikes and my head immediately starts drafting defenses. I'm not sure I follow how the counting alone stops that reflex—I get the theory, but in the moment it doesn't feel like enough. Could you actually say "Back to the breath" when you hear me start rationalizing, and count more slowly or prompt more often?

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll count more slowly to give you more time to respond. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Letting go... 4... (pause) 5... (pause) As you breathe in... notice the sensation in your body... 6... (pause) Let's take another breath together... 7... (pause) Feel the air moving in and out of your body... 8... (pause) Let's stay with the sensation for just a moment... 9... (pause) Can you stay with the breath as we breathe in together?

Patient: I'm trying to stay with the breath — my ribs lifted through the count but around seven that hot, stinging shame slammed in and my head went into its metacognitive cataloguing again, which is confusing and really frustrating. I don't fully follow how the counting stops the reflex; I feel a bit defensive and want a concrete cue. Could you actually say "Back to the breath" when you hear me starting to rationalize, and count more slowly or prompt me every few seconds? I need that prompt so I don't tumble into analysis and lose the sensation.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll count more slowly to give you time to respond. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Let's take another breath... 4... (pause) Feel the air moving in and out of your body... 5... (pause) Now, I want you to focus on your breath... and let's check in in 3... (pause) Can you stay with the sensation of your breath for a moment?

Patient: I'm trying to stay with the breath, but I'm not sure I follow how just sitting with it for a moment actually disrupts the reflex—when that hot, stinging shame surges I get confused and defensive and my mind instantly constructs meta-narratives to neutralize it. Could you actually say "Back to the breath" when you hear me start rationalizing, and count more slowly or prompt every few seconds (maybe every four breaths) so I have a concrete anchor? If you don't, I'll slip into analysis and the frustration and shame just escalate.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll count more slowly to give you time to respond. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Feel the air moving in and out of your body... 4... (pause) Now, can you stay with the sensation of your breath for a moment... 5... (pause) Take another breath... 6... (pause) How are you feeling in this moment... 7... (pause) Let's come back to the breath...

Patient: I'm trying, but honestly I don't fully follow—around seven that hot, stinging shame shoots in and my head immediately starts drafting defenses and cataloguing what it means. I can verbally map the mechanism here (grounding interrupts rumination), but that metacognitive explanation doesn't actually short‑circuit the visceral reflex; in the moment I get confused and defensive. Could you actually say "Back to the breath" when you hear me start rationalizing, and prompt every few breaths with a concrete cue like "notice the chest band" so I have a tangible anchor, otherwise I'll just tumble into analysis and the shame will ramp up.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll prompt every 2-3 breaths with a concrete cue. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Now, notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 4... (pause) Take another breath... 5... (pause) Back to the breath... notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body... 6... (pause) Can you stay with the sensation of the breath for a moment... 7... (pause) Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, feel the weight of your body... 8... (pause) Back to the breath...

Patient: I’m trying to stay with it, but right around four or five a hot, stinging shame slammed into my chest and I got defensive and immediately started cataloguing and arguing with the feeling — it makes me furious and mortified all at once. Honestly, I’m a bit confused: how is alternating cues about my feet or a slow count supposed to short‑circuit that visceral spike? I can articulate the theory — grounding interrupts rumination — but the lived somatic reaction doesn’t care about my theories, so please actually say “Back to the breath” and cue “notice the chest band” every two breaths and count very slowly; I need that concrete anchor or I’ll just slope back into analysis.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll cue "Notice the chest band" every 2 breaths, counting very slowly. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 4... (pause) Back to the breath... (slowly) Inhale... 5... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 6... (pause) Take another breath... 7... (pause) Back to the breath... (slowly) Inhale... 8... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 9... (pause)

Patient: Okay — my ribs rose with the count, but right at nine that hot, stinging shame slammed in and my head immediately went into overdrive, drafting defenses and cataloguing what it all “proves.” I'm honestly confused about the mechanism here: in theory the grounding interrupts rumination, but in practice the somatic spike feels like categorical evidence of failure and pushes me straight into analysis, which makes me mortified and furious. Please actually say “Back to the breath” and cue “notice the chest band” every two breaths, count very slowly, and call me out gently when I start rationalizing so I have a concrete anchor — I need that or I’ll just slip back into argument.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll cue "Notice the chest band" every 2 breaths, counting very slowly. I'll also gently guide you when you start rationalizing. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 4... (pause) Back to the breath... (slowly) Inhale... 5... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 6... (pause) Your chest is still feeling a bit tight, notice that sensation... (pause) Take another breath... 7... (pause) Back to the breath... (slowly) Inhale... 8... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 9... (pause) Your heart is beating, notice that sensation... (pause) Take another breath... 10... (pause) Back to the breath...

Patient: I tried to count with you and my ribs did lift, but right around nine that hot, stinging shame slammed in and my metacognitive reflex went into overdrive—I'm honestly confused about how the counting is supposed to short‑circuit that, it feels more like a cue for the brain to start arguing. I'm mortified and furious at myself about it, and I really need you to actually say "Back to the breath" and call me out when I start rationalizing, and keep prompts focused on the chest/breath rather than switching to feet or abstract cues, otherwise I'll just slip into analysis. Can you do that—call me out gently as soon as I begin to explain away the feeling?

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" as soon as I hear you start rationalizing, and I'll provide gentle guidance and concrete cues focused on the chest and breath. I'll also remind you to stay with the breath when you start to analyze. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 4... (pause) Back to the breath... (slowly) Your chest is still feeling a bit tight... 5... (pause) Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body... 6... (pause) Your breath is slowing down... 7... (pause) Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body... 8... (pause) Take another breath... 9... (pause) Back to the breath... (gently) Notice the sensation of the chest band, feel its texture, its location... (pause) Your chest is feeling a bit softer... 10... (pause)

Patient: Okay — my chest did soften a notch with that last round, but right at the end that hot, searing shame slammed back in and I got furious and immediately started arguing with the feeling. I'm honestly not sure I follow how these counts interrupt the spike; it still feels like a cue for my brain to build defenses, which is confusing and maddening. Can you actually say “Back to the breath” and “notice the chest band” every two breaths and call me out the instant I start rationalizing? I need you to keep guiding me now — keep counting slowly and snap me back when I drift.

Therapist: I'll say "Back to the breath" and "Notice the chest band" every 2 breaths, and I'll call you out immediately when you start rationalizing. I'll count slowly and gently guide you back to the breath. Let's try again. Inhale... 1... (pause) Your chest feels... 2... (pause) Relaxing... 3... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... 4... (firmly) Back to the breath... (slowly) Your chest is still feeling a bit tight... 5... (pause) Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body... 6... (firmly) Back to the breath... (slowly) Your chest is still feeling a bit tight... 7... (pause) Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body... 8... (firmly) Back to the breath... (slowly) Your chest is feeling a bit softer... 9... (pause) Notice the chest band, feel its texture, its location... (firmly) Back to the breath... (slowly) Your chest is feeling a bit more relaxed... 10...

Patient: The chest did soften a bit and my breath steadied, but then that hot, searing shame spikes and I get furious and mortified and immediately start arguing with myself. I'm frustrated and confused — I can map the mechanism with all the right words, but the visceral reflex doesn't care about my theories. Please actually say "Back to the breath" the instant you hear me start rationalizing, keep the prompts slow and chest-focused, and stay with me a little longer because I'm scared I'll just slip back into analysis.
