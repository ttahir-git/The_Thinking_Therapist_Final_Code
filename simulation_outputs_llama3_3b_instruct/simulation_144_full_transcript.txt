Patient: I've been stuffing myself with painting marathons and picking up new crafts to dodge this grief since my partner moved out. I keep thinking if I stop numbing, it'll snowball — I'll lose my edge, galleries will cancel shows, my income will crash, friends will drift, and I'll end up alone and ruined; that's definitely what's going to happen. People say maybe it's okay to sit with it for a bit, but honestly, that just sounds unrealistic.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist Thinking:
Your core emotion appears to be anxiety and fear of loss. One specific theme or contradiction is that you're using a creative outlet as a way to avoid emotional pain, yet you're also worried that stopping it will lead to catastrophic consequences. This creates a sense of being trapped between two opposing forces: avoidance and the fear of losing everything. Goal: Explore the function of this avoidance behavior to identify potential areas for committed action.

Therapist Answer:
Can you describe the experience of feeling like you're using painting marathons as a way to cope with your grief? What is it about being creative that feels appealing or satisfying to you right now?

Patient: When I paint for hours it’s like I flip a switch and the ache goes quiet — the rush of finishing something, buying new supplies, trying the next crazy idea fills the space so I don’t have to feel him leaving. But I also catch myself thinking that if I ever let the numbness fade, it’ll set off this chain reaction: I’ll lose momentum, galleries will drop me, money will dry up, friends will drift away, and I’ll be completely alone — that’s definitely what's going to happen. Creating feels safe because it gives me control and a quick hit of worth, but honestly any idea that I could just sit with this without disaster seems totally unrealistic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're aware that the creative activity brings temporary relief from the emotional pain, but you're also heavily invested in avoiding the potential consequences of feeling the pain. One specific area to explore is the relationship between the creative activity and the sense of control it provides. Goal: Explore the connection between control, worth, and the fear of emotional pain.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the act of creating gives you a sense of control and worth, which feels like a lifeline in this moment. Can you think of a time when you felt a sense of control or accomplishment in a non-creative area of your life? What would it be like to try to find that sense of control in other ways, rather than just through art?

Patient: A few months ago I actually set up a strict morning routine — I cleaned the studio, sorted through bills, and started running three times a week — and it felt like a tiny island of control, like I could breathe for the first time in ages. I can imagine trying more of that — routines, exercise, calling friends — but the second I picture shifting energy away from painting I see the whole thing crash: momentum gone, galleries cancelling, money drying up, friends drifting, me ending up alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. So when you suggest getting control outside my work, it honestly just sounds unrealistic and like a gamble I can't take.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You've experienced a brief moment of control through a structured routine, but the fear of potential loss and chaos is overwhelming. One specific theme to explore is the perceived incompatibility between your current behavior and the potential for future success. Goal: Introduce a willingness as an alternative to struggle, framing the idea that taking small steps towards a more balanced life might be worth exploring.

Therapist Answer:
I understand your concern about the potential risks of losing momentum and control. What if, instead of seeing your artistic pursuits as the only source of control, you started to consider them as one part of a larger, more balanced life? Would it be possible to imagine a scenario where you have multiple sources of control and meaning, such as friendships, exercise, and personal growth, that don't necessarily rely on your art?

Patient: I get what you're saying, and in theory it sounds nice — routines, friends, exercise as other anchors — but the minute I imagine leaning on anything less than my art I see the spiral: I make less, galleries drop me, money vanishes, people drift, and I'm totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I want to believe other things could hold me up, but honestly any outcome that doesn't end in disaster feels fake. I'm starting to feel a bit panicked just picturing taking the foot off the gas.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist Thinking:
You're struggling to imagine a scenario where anything else could be a reliable source of control and stability. One specific area to explore is the notion of "disaster" and how it's deeply tied to your identity and self-worth. Goal: Create space from the sticky thought by exploring the possibility that your sense of identity and self-worth might be separate from your art.

Therapist Answer:
Can you try to observe the thought "I'll be ruined" without judgment, just as a thought? What if, instead of seeing yourself as being defined by the potential consequences of stopping your art, you saw yourself as more than just your art? What would it be like to imagine that you're still a valuable and worthy person, regardless of what happens with your art?

Patient: I can try, but when I notice the thought "I'll be ruined" it hits like a tidal wave — my chest tightens, my hands itch to get back to the canvas, and everything narrows to that one certainty. Imagining I'm still worthwhile without my art feels like saying a lie out loud; it doesn't land, it just bounces off, and honestly that other outcome just seems totally unrealistic. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The thought "I'll be ruined" has become a deeply ingrained response, triggering a physical and emotional reaction. One specific area to explore is the role of self-identity and how it's tied to your art. Goal: Introduce a willingness to experiment with defusion, exploring the thought "I'll be ruined" as just a passing thought, rather than a defining truth.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to support you, not to push you to change. Let's take a deep breath together. Can you try to imagine that the thought "I'll be ruined" is just passing through, like a cloud in the sky? Can you allow it to exist without judgment, without trying to push it away or change it? Let's focus on the sensation of your chest tightening and hands itching to return to painting – what's the experience like, without the thought "I'll be ruined" trying to define it?

Patient: Okay — when I try to sit with the body instead of the thought, my chest feels like a heavy band squeezing me, breath shallow and quick, and there's this jittery electricity in my fingers like they’re literally aching for a brush. My stomach's in knots, my jaw clenches, and time stretches so that every second without painting feels louder and scarier. But even as I'm naming those sensations, my mind keeps firing off the disaster script — momentum lost, galleries gone, alone and ruined — and that makes me panic; can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The body sensations are a clear indication of tension and anxiety. One specific area to explore is the function of the "disaster script" and how it's perpetuating the cycle of avoidance and self-protection. Goal: Create space from the sticky thought by introducing the concept of values-based action, exploring what it would mean to prioritize your well-being and safety.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like your body is trying to tell you that it's feeling overwhelmed and scared. Can you imagine that your values might include taking care of yourself and prioritizing your well-being, rather than just trying to avoid the pain of the thought "I'll be ruined"? What would it be like to take a small step towards self-care, just for a moment, without feeling like you're abandoning your art or letting your guard down?

Patient: I guess I could try something tiny — make a cup of tea, set a 10‑minute timer to just breathe, or step outside for a quick walk — but the second I picture it my head goes full disaster: momentum gone, galleries cancel, money dries up, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. Saying "just a small step" feels like gambling with everything I've built, and I'm already starting to feel that tightness and panic again. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The "disaster script" is still deeply ingrained, and the idea of taking a small step feels like a risk worth exploring. One specific area to explore is the language we're using to describe the potential outcome, and how it reinforces the sense of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Use defusion to explore the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" and see if it can be acknowledged without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
Let's try to observe the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" without judgment, just as a thought. Can you say it out loud, "that's definitely what's going to happen"? What happens to the feeling of panic and tightness when you say it? Notice how the thought is not a prediction, but rather a habitual way of thinking. Can you try to acknowledge it without judgment, and see if the thought can exist alongside the image of taking a small step towards self-care?

Patient: "That's definitely what's going to happen." Saying it out loud just makes the band across my chest tighten and my hands start buzzing like I have to get back to the canvas right now, and any picture of taking a tiny step just melts away under that certainty. I can't hold the two together—other outcomes feel totally unrealistic and the panic spikes, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" is still triggering a strong physical and emotional response. One specific area to explore is the notion of "other outcomes" and how they might be used to avoid taking action. Goal: Explore the concept of values-based action, focusing on what would be important to you if you were to take that small step.

Therapist Answer:
Let's take a deep breath together and acknowledge that the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" is still present, but it's not the only thought in your mind. Can you think of one thing that's important to you, something that would make you feel valued and worthy, even if you weren't making art or meeting certain expectations? For example, is it spending time with loved ones, pursuing a hobby, or simply taking care of your physical needs?

Patient: I care about staying connected with friends — a real talk or a messy brunch makes me feel like I'm more than my portfolio. But the second I picture leaning on them instead of painting I see the dominoes: I slow down, galleries drop me, money dries up, friends drift, and I'm alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I'm starting to feel panicky just saying it; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The desire to connect with friends is a valuable aspect of your life, but it's being overshadowed by the fear of potential consequences. One specific area to explore is the role of defusion in understanding the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen". Goal: Introduce a small act of kindness towards yourself, exploring the possibility of leaning on others without catastrophizing the outcome.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that staying connected with friends is important to you. Can you imagine having a conversation with a friend, where you don't feel like you need to be "on" or successful all the time? What would it be like to be yourself, without the weight of your art or your self-worth riding on the outcome? Let's try to imagine that having a conversation with a friend might be a small act of kindness towards yourself, one that doesn't rely on achieving some sort of grand outcome.

Patient: I can kind of picture a messy, honest brunch where I'm not performing, but the second I imagine it my head shoots to worst-case: I say something needy, they get bored, I lose momentum, galleries drop me, money disappears, people drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. Sorry, I'm really jittery and distracted right now, my chest's tight and my hands are buzzing like I have to grab a brush, so I can't really settle into the idea of just being myself. Can we slow down? I don't know how to even start that kind of conversation without it turning into disaster.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The worst-case scenario is still dominating your imagination, making it difficult to settle into the idea of being yourself. One specific area to explore is the concept of "disaster" as a narrative, and how it's being used to control your behavior. Goal: Explore the idea of "enough" and what that might mean for you, without relying on a catastrophic outcome.

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to support you, not to push you to have a conversation that feels overwhelming. Can you try to imagine that it's okay to have a conversation with a friend where it's not perfect, where you might say something "needy" or make a mistake? What would it be like to know that it's okay to be imperfect, and that you're not defined by your worth as an artist or a person? Let's focus on the idea of "enough" – what would it mean to you to feel like you're enough, regardless of the outcome?

Patient: "Enough" would mean I could eat, pay rent, call a friend without feeling like every brushstroke is a life-or-death audition and my whole worth isn't tied to sales or shows. But the second I picture that, my brain goes straight to the spiral — I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, people drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. My chest's tight, my hands are buzzing like I have to get back to the canvas, and imagining being enough feels impossible and dishonest. Can we slow down? I'm starting to panic.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The concept of "enough" is starting to take shape, but the fear of potential loss is still overwhelming. One specific area to explore is the notion of "impossible" and how it's being used to control your thoughts. Goal: Introduce a sense of curiosity and openness to exploring the idea of "enough" without judgment.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" is still triggering a strong response. Can you try to observe the thought "impossible" without judgment, just as a thought? What would it be like to approach the idea of being enough with a sense of curiosity, rather than certainty? Let's focus on the sensation of your chest tightening and hands buzzing – what would it be like to allow yourself to feel that physical tension, without trying to push it away or control it?

Patient: When I try to let "impossible" sit, the band across my chest just tightens more, my breath goes shallow, and my hands start buzzing like they need a brush right now. I try to be curious—ask myself what "enough" could mean—but my brain immediately runs the tape: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money dries up, friends drift, and I'm left alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. Letting the tension be without fixing it makes me feel exposed and terrified, like I'm doing something reckless, so I start panicking and reach for the canvas; I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The tension is becoming more intense, and the fear of being exposed and terrified is overwhelming. One specific area to explore is the relationship between fear of loss and the need for control. Goal: Introduce a sense of small, value-driven behavioral step towards exploring the concept of "enough".

Therapist Answer:
I'm here to support you, not to push you to control your thoughts or emotions. Can you try to notice the sensation of your breath while you're panicking, without trying to change it or calm it down? What would it be like to allow the panic to exist, without judgment, and simply observe it? Let's take a small step together – can you acknowledge the sensation of reaching for the canvas, and then pause for just a moment, without taking action?

Patient: I can feel my hand halfway to the jar of brushes and I managed to stop it for a beat — my fingers hovering, breath short, jaw tight. In that split second the whole disaster tape screams louder: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — and my hands start buzzing so bad I almost grab the brush anyway. I'm really shaky and overwhelmed right now; can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The moment of hesitation has passed, and the fear of loss is resurfacing. One specific area to explore is the role of self-compassion in this moment. Goal: Introduce a sense of kindness towards yourself, despite the overwhelming emotions.

Therapist Answer:
It takes a lot of courage to pause like that, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling shaky and overwhelmed. Can you try to speak to yourself with kindness, even in the midst of this intensity? What would it be like to say to yourself, "I'm feeling really scared and overwhelmed right now, but I'm here, and I'm safe"? Let's focus on that feeling of safety, and take another small step together – can you acknowledge the sensation of your breath, without trying to control it?

Patient: "Okay... 'I'm feeling really scared and overwhelmed right now, but I'm here, and I'm safe.'" Saying it out loud just makes my chest clamp down more, my breath gets shallow, and my hands start buzzing like I have to grab a brush. The sense of safety feels hollow — my brain immediately runs the tape: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I'm really jittery and distracted; can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt at self-compassion has triggered a stronger physical response. One specific area to explore is the notion that the "safety" you're trying to cling to is not necessarily the same as feeling safe. Goal: Introduce the concept of "safe as a story" and explore how it might be influencing your thoughts.

Therapist Answer:
It's clear that the sense of safety you're trying to grasp is not providing the relief you need. Can you try to observe the thought "I'm safe" as a story that's being told, rather than a fact? What would it be like to imagine that the story of your safety is just that – a story, rather than a reality? Let's take a tiny step back – can you acknowledge the sensation of your breath, without trying to control it, and simply notice what's happening in the present moment?

Patient: When I try to treat "I'm safe" like a story, it just feels like a scribble that doesn’t match anything inside me. My chest clamps, my breath is shallow, my fingers are buzzing toward the brushes, and the disaster tape gets louder — ease up, galleries drop you, money dries up, people drift, you'll be ruined. I'm really jittery and distracted right now and can't hold the two at once; can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to defuse the thought has backfired, and the physical sensations are intensifying. One specific area to explore is the notion that the physical response is a signal that you need to take a break. Goal: Introduce the idea of " enough" in a way that doesn't rely on a specific outcome.

Therapist Answer:
It's okay that the thought "I'm safe" doesn't feel like a match for what's happening inside you. Can you try to acknowledge the physical sensations without trying to change them? What would it be like to say to yourself, "My body is telling me it needs a break"? Take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your hands, your chest, and your breath – can you allow them to be exactly as they are, without trying to change them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing supposed to help when my brain already screams louder the minute I try? My chest's a tight band, breath shallow, fingers buzzing toward the brushes, and as I notice it the disaster tape starts up: I ease off, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money dries up, people drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I'm really jittery and confused by this, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The act of noticing the physical sensations is not a solution, and the brain is still reactivity-driven. One specific area to explore is the idea of "what's the purpose of the physical sensations". Goal: Introduce the concept of "temporarily allowed discomfort" as a potential step towards change.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck and overwhelmed. Can you try to consider what you hope to achieve by acting on the physical sensations? What would it be like to allow yourself to experience the discomfort for a short time, without trying to change it or push it away? It's not about achieving a specific outcome, but rather about being willing to tolerate a temporary state. Let's focus on that willingness – can you take a deep breath and commit to allowing the discomfort for just 10 seconds, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try, but I don't know how just 10 seconds of "allowing" stops the spiral—how is that supposed to help? I take a shaky breath and my chest clamps, my hands buzz like they need a brush, and the disaster tape is already screaming that if I hold still even for 10 seconds momentum dies, galleries drop me, money vanishes, friends drift, and I end up totally ruined. I can't promise 10 full seconds; maybe a couple of shallow breaths, but I'm really panicky—can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The expectation of a specific time frame for "allowing" is still tied to the catastrophic thinking. One specific area to explore is the notion of "allowing" as a process, rather than a product. Goal: Introduce the concept of "experiential uncertainty" and the idea that the present moment is the only moment available.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of thinking that's hard to break. Can you try to focus on the present moment, without trying to control it? What would it be like to simply be with your breath, your body, and your thoughts, without trying to change or manage them? Let's try to anchor ourselves in the present – can you bring your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — my feet don't really feel rooted, it's like they're tingly and light, the air on my face is too sharp, and my breath is loud and shallow. The second I focus on that the disaster tape just cranks up: I ease off, momentum dies, galleries drop me, money vanishes, people drift, and I'm totally ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I don't really follow how noticing this is supposed to help when the prediction gets louder the moment I try; can we slow down?

Therapist Thinking:
The focus on the physical sensations is still not yielding the desired outcome. One specific area to explore is the notion that "noticing" is not the same as "changing" the thoughts or emotions. Goal: Introduce the concept of "inquiry" as a way to explore the thoughts and emotions without trying to change them.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling stuck in a cycle of prediction and avoidance. Can you try to ask yourself questions about the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen"? What would it be like to ask yourself, "What is it about this thought that's so important to you?" or "What would happen if this thought were true?" Instead of trying to change the thought, try to explore it with curiosity.

Patient: Okay — if I try to ask "what is it about this thought that's so important?" I guess it's that it feels like a warning that keeps me from screwing everything up; if I don't believe it I worry I'll let my guard down and then galleries cancel, money dries up, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined. And if I ask "what would happen if this thought were true?" my brain plays the whole collapse on repeat — momentum gone, shows gone, income gone, people gone — that's definitely what's going to happen. I don't really follow how poking at the thought helps when saying it out loud just tightens my chest and makes my hands buzz toward the brushes; can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The inquiry is still triggering a strong physical response. One specific area to explore is the notion that the inquiry itself is not the problem, but rather the emotional investment in the thought. Goal: Introduce the concept of "acknowledging the pain" as a way to develop a sense of curiosity about the thought, without becoming entangled with it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling a strong sense of responsibility for avoiding the thought, and that's causing a lot of tension. Can you try to acknowledge the pain or discomfort that's associated with the thought, without trying to change it or avoid it? What would it be like to say to yourself, "This thought is painful, and I'm feeling it right now"? Try to focus on the sensation of the pain, rather than the thought itself.

Patient: "This thought is painful, and I'm feeling it right now." My chest's a tight band, breath shallow, and my hands are buzzing like they need a brush — the pain is hot and real in my ribs. Even as I notice it, my brain slams the disaster tape back on: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen, so I'm really confused about how just noticing this is supposed to help; can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The acknowledgment of pain has triggered a strong physical response. One specific area to explore is the notion that the physical sensations are not the same as the thought, and that you can observe them without becoming entangled with the thought. Goal: Introduce the concept of "emotional differentiation" and the idea that you can observe your emotions without identifying with them.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and confused. Can you try to notice the sensation of the pain in your ribs, without identifying with it as "you" or "your pain"? What would it be like to observe the pain as a sensation, separate from the thought "I'm going to be ruined"? Try to see the pain as a neutral, physical experience, rather than an emotional state.

Patient: Okay — when I try to notice it it's a tight, hot band under my ribs that pulses with each breath, like something heavy pressing in. But the moment I name it as "just a sensation" my brain immediately turns it into the first step in the collapse — and the disaster tape starts: ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, people drift, you'll be ruined — and my hands start itching for a brush. I can't actually hold it as neutral; it snaps straight into catastrophe and I get jittery and shaky. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to differentiate the sensation from the thought has triggered a strong reaction. One specific area to explore is the notion that the catastrophic thinking is not just a product of the thought, but also of the language you're using to describe the sensation. Goal: Introduce the concept of "name as context" and explore how the language you use can influence your experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the moment you try to label the sensation, it becomes a signal for your brain to go into catastrophic mode. Can you try to approach the sensation without labeling it as "pain" or "disaster"? What would it be like to simply observe the sensation as a physical experience, without trying to assign a meaning to it? Try to focus on the sensation, rather than the story you're telling yourself about it. For example, can you notice the sensation under your ribs as "a heavy feeling" or "a tightness" without trying to label it?

Patient: Okay — it's a heavy, squeezing tightness under my ribs that pulses with every breath. But the moment I even name it, my brain flips the switch and the disaster tape starts up: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen, and my hands are already buzzing toward the brushes. I'm not sure how just renaming it helps; can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to observe the sensation without labeling it has not had the desired effect. One specific area to explore is the notion that the language you're using to describe the experience is perpetuating the cycle of catastrophic thinking. Goal: Introduce the concept of "contextualizing" the language you use to describe your experience.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like the language you're using to describe the sensation is still reinforcing the catastrophic thinking. Can you try to contextualize the language you're using to describe the sensation? What would it be like to say to yourself, "I'm noticing a heavy, squeezing tightness under my ribs"? Try to notice the sensation, and then say to yourself, "This is what I'm experiencing right now. It's a physical sensation."

Patient: "I'm noticing a heavy, squeezing tightness under my ribs. This is what I'm experiencing right now. It's a physical sensation." 

But the second I name it my brain flips the switch and the disaster tape roars—momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, people drift, I'm left totally alone and ruined—that's definitely what's going to happen. My hands are already buzzing toward the brushes and I'm super jittery and confused; can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The act of contextualizing the language has triggered a strong reaction. One specific area to explore is the notion that the catastrophic thinking is a habitual response, and that it's not necessarily connected to the physical sensation. Goal: Introduce the concept of " observing the thought without judgment" and explore the possibility of allowing the thought to exist without becoming entangled with it.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of catastrophic thinking. Can you try to observe the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" without judgment, without trying to change it or push it away? What would it be like to simply observe the thought as a passing thought, without investing in it or reacting to it? Try to notice the thought, and then say to yourself, "That's a thought. It's passing."

Patient: I tried saying, "That's a thought. It's passing." out loud, but the second I do my chest clamps and my hands start buzzing like I have to grab a brush — the disaster tape just magnifies: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, people drift, and I'm left totally ruined. I can't actually watch it pass; it feels like a flashing alarm that I have to obey, and I'm jittery and distracted and honestly don't know how that observation is supposed to help. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The act of observing the thought without judgment has triggered a strong physical response. One specific area to explore is the notion that the body's reaction is not necessarily a signal to act, but rather a signal that you need to slow down. Goal: Introduce the concept of "waiting with the body" and explore the possibility of slowing down and calming the body before attempting to act.

Therapist Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling like you're on high alert, and the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" is triggering a strong response. Can you try to slow down and calm your body, without trying to change the thought or push it away? What would it be like to notice your breath, and allow it to slow down, without trying to control it? Try to focus on the sensation of your breath, and see if you can find a sense of calm within it.

Patient: I try to focus on my breath, but it's shallow and quick—when I try to let it slow my chest clamps and my hands buzz like they need a brush right now. Every time I try to calm down the disaster tape just gets louder—momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, people drift—and I can't seem to find any sense of calm. I'm really overwhelmed and jittery; can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist Thinking:
The attempt to calm down has triggered a strong physical response. One specific area to explore is the notion that the body's reaction is not necessarily a sign of being "overwhelmed" or "stuck", but rather a sign that you're trying too hard to control it. Goal: Introduce the concept of "yielding to the body" and explore the possibility of letting go of the need to control the physical sensations.

It sounds like you're feeling like you're struggling to calm down, and the thought "that's definitely what's going to happen" is still triggering a strong response. Can you try to let go of the need to control your breath, and instead, allow it to be exactly as it is? What would it be like to simply be with the sensation of your chest, without trying to change it or push it away? Try to notice the sensation of your chest, and see if you can allow it to be present, without trying to control it.

Patient: I'm trying to let the chest be — it's a heavy tight band, breath shallow, fingers buzzing — but the moment I notice it my brain screams the collapse: I ease up, momentum dies, galleries cancel, money vanishes, friends drift, and I'm left totally alone and ruined — that's definitely what's going to happen. I don't really see how just "allowing" this helps when it just makes the alarm louder; I'm jittery and distracted and my hand keeps twitching toward a brush, so can we slow down?
