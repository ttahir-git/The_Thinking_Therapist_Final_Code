Patient: I've been really on edge since the kids moved out — little things set me off and I end up snapping at people. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts the worst: I see them cutting me out, my teaching falling apart because I'm distracted, and me ending up completely alone, and I can't stop replaying that like it's already happened. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't seem to believe any other outcome; other possibilities feel unrealistic.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you value most in your relationships with your kids, and what you hope to experience in your life now that they're living apart?

Patient: I really value feeling connected and needed — hearing about their days, being included in family stuff, and that easy, silly rapport we used to have. I hope to build a life that's still full — more time for friends, travel, maybe projects at school — but my mind immediately goes to the worst: I can already see them drifting away, stopping calls, my students noticing I'm distracted so my teaching collapses, and then I'm left completely alone in this empty house. I get angry and snap because I'm terrified that timeline is inevitable, and honestly, when people suggest other outcomes it just feels like unrealistic wishful thinking.

Therapist: Can you imagine yourself having a conversation with a friend, someone you haven't seen in a while, and they ask you about your day? What's the first thought that comes up for you, and what happens next?

Patient: The first thing that pops up is, "They'll hear me sounding tired and decide I'm a mess they don't want around," and I immediately picture them slowly drifting away. Then my mind runs the whole chain: fewer invites, my kids talk less, I get irritable and snap more, my students notice I'm off and my teaching suffers, and before I know it I'm alone in this empty house with no one. I know that sounds dramatic, but that story grabs me and I can't seem to let any other outcome in.

Therapist: That story you just shared sounds really overwhelming. How might it be possible that your identity and value as a person aren't defined solely by your relationship with your kids, but also by other aspects of your life, like your relationships with friends, your work as a teacher, and even the connections you make with students like yours?

Patient: I hear you, but my brain just won't buy it — I keep seeing friends get tired of me, my teaching sliding because I'm distracted, and even the students drifting away until I'm totally alone. Trying to tell myself I'm more than my kids feels like slapping a Band-Aid on a sinking ship, and that makes me irritated and impatient. I don't know how to actually believe those other parts will hold up when my mind insists the worst is coming.

Therapist: Can you try to approach the thought that your mind keeps coming back to, but instead of trying to argue with it or change it, simply acknowledge it as a thought - just as it is, without judgment - and then say to yourself, "I'm willing to hold this thought, even if it feels uncomfortable or untrue"?

Patient: Okay, I'll try: "I'm willing to hold this thought, even if it feels uncomfortable or untrue." I can say it, but it feels empty — like I'm just inviting that awful forecast to sit down and make itself at home. My brain immediately goes back to them drifting away, my teaching falling apart, and me ending up utterly alone, and that makes me angry and impatient because this feels pointless.

Therapist: Can you bring your attention to your body and notice where you feel the tension or discomfort when you think about that forecast? Is it in your chest, shoulders, or elsewhere?

Patient: Mostly in my chest — a heavy tightness like something's pressing down, and this lump in my throat. My shoulders and neck lock up, my jaw clenches, my stomach twists into a knot, and my hands get jittery so my breathing gets shallow. The minute I try to notice it, that fortune-telling voice gets louder and I get angrier because it feels like sitting with this just hands the story more power. I don't know if this helps, but that's what it feels like.

Therapist: Would you be willing to allow yourself to sit with this physical tension for just 30 seconds, without trying to change it, breathe into it, and simply observe it as it is - without judgment or trying to push it away?

Patient: I'll try, but I hate doing this because I'm afraid it'll just let that awful forecast take over. I sat with the tightness in my chest and breathed for about 30 seconds, and instead of calming down the fortune-telling voice actually got louder — my jaw clenched, my hands felt jittery, and I got more irritated and restless. It felt like I was just handing the story more power, and now I'm annoyed and not sure this is helping.

Therapist: I can see that this is really tough for you. It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck in this cycle of trying to control your thoughts, and it's causing more distress. Can you imagine that you're willing to keep trying, even if it's just for a tiny step - like taking a few deep breaths, or noticing your feet on the ground - and see if that gives you a sense of calm, rather than more anxiety?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. I took a few slow breaths and really felt my feet on the floor — for a second my shoulders loosened and the tightness in my chest eased a bit. But as soon as I noticed that small calm, the fortune-telling voice rushed back in louder than before and I got irritated, like I'm just stalling the inevitable. I want this to help, but I don't know if these tiny steps actually change that awful story.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck between the desire to try and the fear that these small steps won't be enough. Can you think about what it would take for you to feel more confident and at ease in your life, even if it's not possible to change the worst-case scenario? What would be one small, specific thing that would make you feel more grounded and connected to your values?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is setting a tiny thing supposed to stop that whole awful slide I'm predicting? Maybe a specific thing could be a 15-minute Sunday call with one kid or committing to one weekly activity (like a book club or volunteering at school) so I have at least one small, regular connection. But honestly, my brain already says they'll stop answering or get bored, the club will fizzle, and it'll just prove I'm being left behind, so I don't know if even that would help.

Therapist: Can you try to explore this thought "They'll stop answering or get bored" with a bit more curiosity? What does this thought mean for you, exactly? Is it that you feel a sense of loss or abandonment, or is it that you feel like you're not good enough, or something else?

Patient: Okay — I'm not sure I follow exactly, but I'll try. That thought feels like pure abandonment: not just fewer texts but like I'm being erased, like I'm suddenly useless and not good enough — which touches this core fear that I've failed as a parent and a teacher. It means losing my role, losing people I care about, and ending up alone in that empty house, and that makes me furious and desperate; I snap because I want to shove that future away. When you ask me to be curious it almost feels like you're asking me to pretend the cliff I'm staring at isn't real.

Therapist: Can you imagine that your worth and value as a person, parent, and teacher are not defined by these fears, but by your own sense of what's truly important to you? What would it mean to you to be a good parent, and a good teacher, and what kind of relationships do you want to have with your kids and your students?

Patient: To me, being a good parent means staying present and emotionally available — someone they can laugh with, lean on, and still turn to; being a good teacher means showing up passionate, fair, and making my students feel seen. But my brain immediately spins the worst: even if I do those things, they'll quietly stop inviting me, decide I'm clingy, my snapping pushes them away, the students pick up my distraction and my teaching tanks, and then everything just collapses. I want easy, connected relationships with honest talks and shared jokes, but I don't trust that outcome — every small step feels like evidence I'm heading for that cliff, and that makes me furious and scared.

Therapist: Can you imagine that it's okay to not have all the answers, and that it's possible to be present and connected with others even if the outcome isn't certain? What would it mean to you to take a small step towards showing up more fully for your kids and students, even if it's just for a minute, without trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I can try to picture it, but my brain won't let me. Maybe a small step would be a quick 10-minute Sunday call with one kid or staying five minutes after class to chat with a student, but I can already see the whole awful scene: they’ll think I’m clingy, the call will be short and awkward, they’ll stop replying, other parents/students will notice me trying too hard and start to pull away, and it all proves I was right about being left behind. That makes me furious and exhausted — how is this supposed to help when every little move just feels like more evidence of the cliff?

Therapist: I understand that it's hard to imagine a positive outcome, but can you try to focus on the small act of taking the first step, rather than the entire journey? Instead of worrying about the outcome of the 10-minute call, try to focus on the physical sensation of picking up the phone and speaking with your child, or sitting down with a student after class.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is focusing on the physical act supposed to stop the whole cliff I'm predicting? I tried picturing just picking up the phone and talking for ten minutes, but my chest tightens, my hands shake, and the fortune-telling voice already scripts the whole thing: awkward call, they pull back, it proves I'm right. It just makes me angry and feels pointless — what am I missing here?

Therapist: Can you try to approach this experience with a sense of curiosity, rather than trying to avoid the outcome? What if, instead of focusing on the potential pitfalls of the call, you simply notice the sensation of your heart beating, the sensation of your fingers on the phone, or the sound of your own voice?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. I notice my heart pounding, my fingers are cold on the imagined phone, my voice sounds small in my head, and my chest is tight like before. For a second that focus made the tightness ease a little, but then the fortune-telling voice shot back in and scripted the awkward call and them pulling away, which made me angry and more hopeless. I'm not sure how noticing my heartbeat is supposed to stop that whole collapse, so I'm confused and kind of irritated right now.

Therapist: I can see that we're having trouble with defusion. Can we pivot to exploring values-based action instead? What is it that matters most to you in this situation? What would it mean to you to take this small step, and how would that align with your values as a parent and a teacher?

Patient: What matters most is feeling connected and needed — being someone my kids can turn to and a teacher who shows up for students. Making a small step, like a 10-minute Sunday call or staying five minutes after class, would feel like living those values: being present, available, and showing care. But my brain immediately scripts it as awkward, them pulling away, colleagues and students noticing me as needy, and that tiny step just becomes evidence that I'm sliding toward being alone — which makes me furious and confused about how this is supposed to help.

Therapist: Let's take a step back and look at what's happening right now. Can you bring your attention to your breath, and notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body? Try to focus on the present moment, without judgment, and see if you can observe your thoughts and emotions without getting caught up in them.

Patient: I'm trying, but I'm not sure I follow — I can feel the air going in and out, and my shoulders softened for a second, but the fortune-telling voice slammed back in louder than before and started narrating the whole collapse, which made me angrier and more frustrated. It feels like paying attention to my breath just stalls the inevitable instead of changing it, so I'm confused about how this is supposed to help.

Therapist: I understand that you're feeling frustrated. Can you try something radical? Can you simply acknowledge that the fortune-telling voice is present, and that it's okay to feel the anger and frustration that comes with it? No effort to change, no trying to stop the thoughts, just a simple acknowledgement of the fact that this is what's happening right now.

Patient: Alright — the fortune-telling voice is here, loud as ever: they'll drift away, my teaching will fall apart, and I'll end up alone. I'm angry and terrified; my chest is tight, my jaw's clenched, and it feels raw. I can say it's okay to feel that anger, but I don't know if saying it actually helps — it feels like I'm inviting the whole story in, and that makes me irritated. What do you want me to do with that?

Therapist: I'm not asking you to do anything with the thoughts, I'm just acknowledging them as they are. Can you try to observe the physical sensations in your body, like the tightness in your chest, the clenching of your jaw, without judgment? Just notice it, as if you're looking at a neutral object, without trying to change it or react to it.

Patient: Okay... I'm trying to notice it, but my chest feels like it's being squeezed, my jaw's clenched, my hands are jittery, my breath is shallow and fast, and my stomach's all tied up. The more I look, the louder that fortune-telling voice gets — I can already see the whole collapse and I get angrier and more panicked. I don't get how just noticing this helps; it feels like I'm giving the story more power and I'm starting to lose focus — what am I missing?

Therapist: I think I understand what's happening. Can you check in with me, and tell me what's going on in terms of your values? What's most important to you right now, and how does this experience of being overwhelmed and anxious relate to those values?

Patient: What matters most is feeling connected and needed — with my kids, my friends, and being that teacher who actually shows up for kids. Right now I'm just overwhelmed and anxious: my chest's tight, I can't focus, I'm jumpy, and my mind's already running the whole disaster script — they'll drift, I'll snap, students notice, and everything falls apart — so any move I make feels pointless. That eats at me: I either get short and angry (which goes against being present) or I try too hard to control things and come off needy. I'm angry and confused — if my brain's certain the worst will happen, how am I supposed to act from those values without feeling like I'm pretending?

Therapist: I think I understand. You're feeling stuck between trying to be present and not wanting to pretend to be something you're not. Can you think of a small, imperfect action that feels more in line with your values of being connected and needed? Not a perfect solution, just a tiny step that would make you feel like you're showing up for others, even if it's just for a minute?

Patient: Maybe I'll try a one-sentence Sunday text to one kid — just “thinking of you, love you” — or stay five minutes after class one day a week to check in with a student. But my chest's already tight imagining them ignoring it or finding it awkward, which will definitely prove I'm clingy and kick off that whole slide, so I'm skeptical this will do any good.

Therapist: I want you to commit to taking that one-sentence text or staying after class, not because you think it will solve everything, but because it feels like a small act of kindness and care that aligns with your values. Can you make a decision to take that action, without considering the outcome, just for the sake of taking it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try. I'll send that one-sentence Sunday text this week and stay five minutes after class one day, but I'm jittery and distracted just saying it, and my brain's already screaming that they'll ignore it and it'll prove I'm clingy. I want to do it because it feels like the right, small thing, but I’m angry and afraid it’ll just make the whole worst-case story louder.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really anxious and uncertain about the outcome. Can you try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, like the tension in your shoulders or the pounding in your heart, and allow them to be present without judgment?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to notice: chest's tight, jaw clenched, shoulders up, breathing shallow, hands a bit shaky. But the more I pay attention the fortune-telling voice just screams louder — I can already see them pulling away, my little gestures read as needy, and everything proving me right, which makes me more panicked and distracted. I want to sit with this without judgment, but it feels like I'm fueling the story — what am I supposed to do with that?

Therapist: Can you try to anchor yourself in the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin? Sometimes, finding a small physical anchor can help calm the nervous system and reduce feelings of overwhelm. Can you try to focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground, for just a few more breaths?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to feel my feet on the floor, I can sense the weight on my heels and it steadies me for a second. But it's such a tiny relief; the fortune-telling voice immediately scripts them pulling away and my teaching collapsing, and the panic rushes back. I'm frustrated and confused — how is feeling my feet supposed to stop that whole slide when the story just swallows the anchor?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. Can you try to explore this emotional experience with me, rather than trying to change it? What would it mean to you to process this anxiety, rather than trying to push it away or control it? Can you tell me more about what it feels like to experience this panic, without judgment or evaluation?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow, but I'll try. When the panic comes it's like my chest is being crushed, my breathing goes shallow and fast, my hands tremble and my jaw locks up, and my mind instantly starts that worst-case script — them pulling away, my teaching falling apart, me alone — on repeat. I get furious and snap because it feels like the only way to shove that future back, and then I feel guilty and more panicked, like I'm trapped in the story. I'm distracted and can't focus right now; it just keeps looping and makes everything feel heavier.

Therapist: I can see that you're feeling really overwhelmed. Can you try to focus on the physical sensations in your body, without judgment, and see if you can find any small areas where the discomfort is present, but not overwhelming? For example, can you notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, in a way that's not trying to change or avoid anything?

Patient: I can feel my feet on the floor — a little weight on my heels and the carpet is cool under my toes — and the air on my face for a second steadies me. But it's such a tiny thing; almost immediately the fortune-telling voice screams the whole collapse again — they stop answering, my students see I'm a wreck, my teaching falls apart, and I'm alone — and that makes me jumpier and angrier. I don't really get how noticing this is supposed to help; it feels like a brief pause before the inevitable, and now I'm distracted and impatient.

Therapist: I think I understand. It sounds like you're feeling a bit like you're stuck in this cycle of catastrophic thinking. Can you try to think about what it would take for you to take that small action we discussed earlier - the one-sentence text or staying after class - and what might happen if you do take it? What are some of the things that might happen, and how might it feel to take that action, even if it's not perfect?

Patient: I guess what it'd take is a chunk of courage — scripting the text so I don't babble, forcing myself to pick up the phone even though my hands will shake, maybe doing it when I feel as calm as possible and setting a two-minute limit so I don't spiral. But the minute I hit send or stay after class, my brain already plays the tape: they ignore it or answer politely and then stop, people notice me trying too hard and start to distance themselves, my students pick up my distraction and my teaching slips, and that one small act becomes the first clear sign I'm being left behind. If I do it, I can see the physical stuff: chest tight, jaw clenched, voice small, then a rush of humiliation and anger that makes me snap later — so even “trying” just feeds the whole collapse in my head. I want to try it because it lines up with my values, but honestly I don't believe it will change anything — what if I'm just making the evidence I fear?
