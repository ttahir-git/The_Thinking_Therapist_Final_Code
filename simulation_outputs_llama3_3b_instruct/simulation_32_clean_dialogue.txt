Patient: Lately I've been feeling stuck and directionless since the move, like being a chef is the only thing that gives me purpose. I'm in my sixties and it's worrying—I don't know what matters to me beyond the kitchen. I've tried talking about this before and I'm skeptical this will help—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what you mean by "being a chef is the only thing that gives you purpose"? Is there something specific about cooking that makes you feel fulfilled, or is it more about the identity and routine that comes with being a chef?

Patient: It's both—the actual act of cooking still lights me up; the smells, the timing, getting something just right, and people saying it matters. But it's also the identity and the routine—the kitchen gave me a place, a role, a little tribe, and now that I'm in a new town I feel invisible and hollow without that structure. I keep doubting myself, and I've tried finding other things to fill it before and it didn't stick—how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the kitchen not only provides a sense of purpose but also a sense of identity and belonging. It's like the kitchen is a part of who you are, and now that's gone. Can you imagine if, instead of trying to find a new kitchen or a new identity, you started small and explored what it would be like to find moments of connection and meaning in your daily life here in this new town, even if it's not through cooking?

Patient: I get what you mean, but I've tried little things—joined a class, chatted with folks at the market—and they never fill the hole the kitchen does. Cooking has rhythm and responsibility; those tiny moments feel flimsy and forgettable compared to that. How is that supposed to help me feel any less hollow or like I belong?

Therapist: So, it sounds like the kitchen's rhythm and responsibility are deeply ingrained in your experience of yourself. I'd like to gently challenge that thought, not by trying to replace it, but by exploring what happens when you notice this thought, instead of identifying with it. Can you observe the thought "I feel hollow and disconnected" as a thought, rather than a reality, without judgment?

Patient: I tried noticing it like that before, but it mostly feels like pretending—the hollow feeling just sits there, stubborn. When I try to step back and observe, I end up criticizing myself or telling myself to "snap out of it," which just makes me feel worse. I don't see how that helps, but I can try to pay attention—right now it feels heavy, like an empty pan I keep turning and nothing comes together.

Therapist: I can see that noticing the thought without judgment is tough, and it's understandable that it feels heavy. Instead of trying to turn it around, what if we explored what would happen if, right now, you simply allowed yourself to feel that weight, without trying to change it?

Patient: All right—I'll try that, but it already feels like a heavy sack in my chest, like a pan of sauce that won't thicken no matter how long I stir. Letting it sit makes me anxious; I'm scared it'll just be there forever and I'll lose whatever's left of me outside the kitchen. How is sitting with that supposed to help? It feels too passive—like I'd just be simmering in the same emptiness and getting rusty.

Therapist: I can see that the fear of losing your sense of self is really at the heart of this. What is it about feeling like you're losing yourself outside of the kitchen that feels most scary to you?

Patient: What scares me most is becoming invisible—like without the kitchen's proof that I matter, I'm just taking up space and nobody notices me. I worry I'll lose my confidence and skills, that I'll get old and useless, and all the little things I used to enjoy will feel pointless. I've tried telling myself I'm more than a chef and it doesn't stick—how is talking about this supposed to change that?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of losing your sense of purpose and identity is connected to a deeper fear of losing your sense of self-worth. What is it about feeling seen and valued that matters most to you?

Patient: Being seen and valued means someone notices that what I do — my hands, my recipes, the way I time things — still makes a difference. It's not just praise; it's proof I belong and I'm useful, and that keeps the doubt from eating me alive. I get why you'd ask, but how is talking about that supposed to make anyone actually notice me here?

Therapist: I understand that external validation isn't the only way to feel seen. Can you imagine, instead of waiting for someone to notice you, what would it be like if you were to take small, everyday actions that honor your skills and passion, even if no one else is around to see them?

Patient: I can picture it—plating a little meal for myself, tinkering with a sauce just to hear the sizzle, or jotting down an old recipe—but I've done private rituals like that before and they never stick. They feel like rehearsal for an audience that never shows up. How is doing those small things supposed to give me the same kind of proof I get when someone tastes my food and says it matters?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of not having an audience to share your creations with is holding you back. Can you notice what happens when you think "I'm only doing this for others to notice"? Is that thought helping you feel any more connected to your desire for recognition?

Patient: When I think "I'm only doing this for others to notice," it tightens my chest and makes everything feel performative—like I'm plating for ghosts. It doesn't help me feel more connected; it just reminds me I crave proof from outside and then I get needy and resentful. Maybe noticing it sometimes shows me what I really want, but mostly it just nags and makes me doubt myself more—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that thought is actually causing more suffering than insight. What if, instead of trying to avoid or change that thought, you were to simply allow it to be, without judgment, and see what would happen?

Patient: I get what you're saying about letting the thought be, but when I try that it just sits there like a cold pot on the stove and I end up stewing—my mind starts muttering I'm useless and nothing really changes. Maybe once in a while it gives a tiny bit of space, but mostly it just makes me anxious and stuck. How is that supposed to help me, really—do you expect it to suddenly make me feel seen or less hollow, or am I missing something?

Therapist: I think we've been exploring the idea of allowing the thought to simply be, but it's clear that's not yielding the results you're hoping for. Can you tell me what would need to happen for you to feel like you're moving forward, rather than getting stuck? What's the smallest, most concrete action you could take in the next few days that would give you a sense of progress?

Patient: Okay—small and concrete: I'll sign up for one four-hour shift at the local community kitchen this week and be responsible for one dish or a station. It at least gives me that rhythm and someone to cook for, which is the kind of proof I need—even if I've done volunteer stuff before and it didn't fix things. How is that supposed to help, though—what should I be watching for while I'm there so I can actually tell if it's making even a tiny difference?

Therapist: That sounds like a great step! While you're at the community kitchen, I'd like you to pay attention to what happens when you're fully engaged in your work, particularly when you're not worried about what others think or how you're perceived. What are some specific sensations, thoughts, or physical sensations that arise when you're fully immersed in cooking, and are those things helpful or unhelpful?

Patient: When I'm really in it, it's the smell of onions and butter, the hiss of the pan, the clock ticking—my hands kind of take over and my head quiets. My breathing slows, my shoulders drop, I'm sharper and feel useful; time shrinks and the doubt blurs. The pesky stuff is that waiting-for-praise voice and the fear it won't last. I'll watch for steady breathing, how fast time goes, whether the critic quiets, and if I actually feel any connection to the people I'm cooking for — but honestly, how is paying attention to that supposed to change anything long-term?

Therapist: It sounds like the sense of flow and engagement while cooking is closely tied to feelings of usefulness and connection. Can you think of a value that might be connected to this experience, such as feeling needed, contributing, or being present for others?

Patient: I guess the value is being useful — craftsmanship and connection, really: doing something I can be proud of that helps other people and proves I still matter. Naming it feels a bit thin though; I don't see how a label makes the hollow any smaller. How is knowing that supposed to help me actually feel less invisible or give me something that sticks?

Therapist: I think we've been exploring the value of being useful, and that's a great start. Instead of focusing on the label, what if we explored what would happen if you were to simply show up to the community kitchen with the intention of being useful, without expecting praise or recognition? What if you were to focus on the process of being present, contributing, and creating something that matters, rather than the end result?

Patient: Alright — I'll go and try to show up with the intention of being useful, focusing on the process and not the applause, but I'm skeptical it'll stick. How am I supposed to tell if it's actually making a difference while I'm there — aside from the breathing and time-fly signs I already notice? And if it feels hollow again, what should I do in the moment so I don't just walk away convinced nothing can change?

Therapist: That's a great question. While you're at the community kitchen, I'd like you to pay attention to your physical sensations and emotions, like we discussed earlier. Notice when you feel a sense of calm, focus, or connection to others, and when you feel like you're just going through the motions. However, I want you to also pay attention to the sensation of curiosity – when you start to wonder, "What would happen if I tried something new?" or "How would this make me feel if I succeeded?" This curiosity can be a sign that you're staying engaged and motivated. If you do start to feel hollow, I want you to pause and ask yourself, "What's one small step I can take right now to continue moving forward, even if it feels uncomfortable?"

Patient: Alright—I can try that. While I'm at the community kitchen I'll watch for the breathing, the time-flying, and any little sparks of curiosity—like thinking, "What if I try a different herb?" or "Maybe I could plate this a bit neater." If I start feeling hollow, I'll do one tiny step: take five slow breaths, tweak one element of the dish, or offer a plate to someone to see their reaction, then note how that lands. I'm willing to try it, but honestly—I still doubt a tweak or a taste will quiet this feeling long-term. If it feels empty again in the moment, what should I do next so I don't just walk away convinced nothing can change?

Therapist: It's great that you're willing to take small steps and experiment. If, after trying out these steps, you find that the feeling of emptiness returns, I'd like you to consider what's at stake for you. What is it about feeling seen and useful that matters most to you? What would it take for you to feel like you're making progress towards that?

Patient: What matters most is having proof I still matter—not just feeling useful for a moment, but being relied on so I don’t feel like a burden or invisible. I think progress would look like steady, repeatable things: a regular shift or role people depend on, a small ongoing project (a signature dish or teaching one class), and honest feedback so I don’t slip back into doubt. Right now my chest's tight and my mind's jumpy—I've tried this before and it faded, so I'm skeptical it will stick; how am I supposed to keep going when the praise runs out?

Therapist: It sounds like you're saying that what matters most to you is being seen and valued as a reliable, contributing member of the community. Can you think of a specific relationship or experience in your life where you've felt seen and valued as a contributing member, and what was that like for you? What values or qualities were being honored in that experience?

Patient: I guess the clearest time was at my old restaurant with that little crew I ran for years — the line cooks, the baker, and a regular who always asked for whatever I was proudest of that week. They trusted me to call the shots, to keep the rhythm, and to teach when things went wrong; that mattered more than compliments — it was being relied on. Sorry, I'm kind of jumpy right now, my chest is tight and my mind's all over, but remembering it feels...both comforting and like a sting because it shows what I'm missing. How is remembering that supposed to make it stick here, though — how do I get that kind of steady dependability again?

Therapist: It's understandable that remembering this experience feels bittersweet. Can you try to connect the feeling of being relied upon to this experience, not as a way to recreate the past, but as a way to inform your present and future. What would it take for you to feel like you're being called upon and trusted in this new kitchen, even if it's not exactly the same as before? What would need to happen for you to feel like you're part of a team, rather than just a solo cook?

Patient: I think it would take concrete, repeatable things: a regular shift here, being assigned a station someone else expects me to run, being asked for my opinion on a menu or to teach a short demo — real responsibilities that force others to rely on me. My chest's tight and my mind's jumpy right now and I keep thinking folks won't stick around to depend on me, so how is me asking for responsibility supposed to make them actually trust me? Maybe I'll offer to run a weekly shift or a one-off class to start, but if it fades again what do I do in the moment so I don't just retreat and convince myself it's hopeless?

Therapist: It's great that you're thinking about concrete ways to establish responsibility. I'd like to propose a small, immediate action to take right now, rather than waiting for someone to assign a shift or ask for your opinion. What if, in the next 5-10 minutes, you simply start thinking about what kind of dish you'd like to make, or what skills you'd like to share with others? Would that be a small, low-stakes way to start taking action, and perhaps even spark some ideas for how to build on that momentum?

Patient: Alright—I can try, but my chest's tight and I'm kind of jittery so I might not hold focus for ten full minutes. I can think of a simple braised short-rib dish—something steady, slow-cooked that shows technique—and a short demo on sauce reduction or on knife sharpening that people could actually use. I don't see how jotting that down magically makes folks rely on me, but I'll write one dish and one skill now and see if it gives me a tiny bit of momentum.

Therapist: That sounds like a great start. Writing down the ideas is a small step, and it's a tangible action that can help you feel more grounded. As you write, can you notice what happens in your body? Notice if your tension starts to ease, or if you feel a tiny spark of excitement about the idea?

Patient: When I actually write it down my shoulders loosen a hair and my breath gets a bit steadier—there's a tiny flicker when I picture the sauce reducing. But it never lasts: in a few seconds my chest tightens again and my head starts yelling "what if no one cares?" How is noticing that supposed to keep the spark from getting snuffed out when the doubt jumps back in?

Therapist: It sounds like the doubt is like a strong gust of wind that's quickly blowing out the spark. Can you try to notice that thought, "What if no one cares?" as a thought, rather than a reality? Can you say to yourself, "Ah, there's that doubt creeping in again" and then gently let it go, without trying to chase after it or evaluate its validity?

Patient: I can try saying, "Ah, there's that doubt creeping in again," but right now my chest tightens and my head just gets louder—I'm jumpy and it mostly feels like pretending. Saying it out loud doesn't make the thought leave; it just sits there hollower. How is that actually supposed to stop me from spiraling or walking away? If noticing doesn't work, what's one tiny thing I can do in the moment to keep going instead of retreating?

Therapist: I think we've been exploring the idea of noticing, and while it's a great start, it's clear that more is needed to sustain the spark. One tiny thing you could try, right now, is to take a small physical action. Can you take one tiny step towards your goal, like standing up from the table, stretching, or taking a sip of water? Sometimes, a small physical movement can help ground us and create space for a sense of momentum to build.

Patient: Alright—I stood up, rolled my shoulders, and took a slow swallow of water. It did loosen my breathing a little, but my chest's still tight and my mind's skittering—I'm still thinking, "What if this fizzles and I just leave?" How is that supposed to stop me from bailing when the doubt hits?

Therapist: It sounds like the doubt is still strong. Can you try to notice what happens when you imagine yourself walking away from this experience, rather than staying and trying to make it work? What would that feel like, physically and emotionally?

Patient: If I imagine walking away, at first my shoulders drop and my breathing eases like a little relief—then it turns into this cold hollow in my chest, like an emptied pan, and a rush of shame and defeat hits me. Emotionally I feel lighter for a minute, then lonelier and more invisible, my head filling with “See? It never sticks” and “I was useless all along.” I'm jumpy and my mind's skittering right now, so noticing that just tends to make me spiral—how is picturing the walk-out supposed to help me actually stay and not bail? What could I do in that exact moment so the relief doesn't turn into retreat?

Therapist: I understand that picturing the walk-out can be counterproductive. In that moment, can you try to focus on the physical sensation of your feet on the ground? Notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor, the feeling of your weight distributed on your legs, and the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. This can help ground you in the present moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts of walking away or self-doubt.

Patient: I did it — felt my feet on the floor, like bracing at the stove, and my breath slowed a hair. For a few seconds the tightness eased, but then my mind started skittering again and I felt that urge to bolt. How is focusing on my feet supposed to stop me from walking out when the doubt hits? If grounding doesn't hold, what's one tiny thing I can do in that exact moment to keep myself from leaving?

Therapist: It's great that focusing on your feet helped slow down your breath and ease some tension. In the next moment, when you feel the urge to bolt, I want you to try a tiny, tiny action: touch your forehead. Yes, just lightly touch your forehead with your finger. That's it. It's a small, gentle, and automatic action that can help you pause and create a tiny bit of space between you and the doubt. Can you try that?

Patient: Okay — I touched my forehead like you said. It bought me a beat; my breath eased a little and I didn't lunge for the door, but my chest is still tight and my mind's racing. How is that tiny touch supposed to stop me from bolting when the doubt hits so hard?

Therapist: That tiny touch was a great start. Now, I want to connect it to the value of being useful and contributing. Can you think of a specific time when you felt like you were being useful and contributing, and how that felt? Not just in terms of what you accomplished, but in terms of how you felt in your body and mind?

Patient: Yeah — I can picture a night at my old place: a full house, a panicked line cook called out, and I stepped in, called the shots, and kept the service moving. In my body it was calm and centered — hands steady, shoulders down, breath even, a warm steady weight in my chest like I belonged and mattered; my mind was quiet and sharp. But right now my chest's tight and my head's skittering, and I have to ask — how is remembering that supposed to stop me from folding when it doesn't show up here?
