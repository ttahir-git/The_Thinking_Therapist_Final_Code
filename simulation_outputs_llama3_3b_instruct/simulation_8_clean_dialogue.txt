Patient: I've been worrying constantly about my performance as an artist — I keep thinking everything I make won't be good enough, and that worry just makes me put things off until deadlines are right on top of me. I lost more steady work a while back and it made the doubt worse, even though I try to stay adaptable. I don't know, I guess I don't really like talking about this much.

Therapist: Can you tell me more about what happens when you're working on a project and that worry starts to creep in? What would it be like to pause for just one moment and acknowledge the worry without acting on it, before getting back to the work?

Patient: When the worry shows up I just freeze and then start avoiding — cleaning, scrolling, anything to not face the canvas, and suddenly the deadline feels crushing. I don't know... if I tried to pause and name it I'd feel exposed and probably tell myself I'm being silly and go back to avoiding. I guess maybe if I could do that without beating myself up it might help, but I'm not great at stopping the spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to escape the discomfort of the worry, but in doing so, you might be creating more suffering. Can you imagine that labeling the worry as "this feeling of not being good enough" or "this fear of missing a deadline" might be a way to acknowledge it, rather than trying to push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess maybe calling it out like "I'm feeling not good enough" could help a bit, but it also feels embarrassing and vulnerable. I can already hear myself thinking I'm being dramatic and then I shut down and avoid the work. Can we... maybe talk about small ways to try it without tipping into that shame?

Therapist: Let's try a small experiment: can you imagine saying "I'm feeling anxious about not meeting the deadline" to yourself, without judgment, just as a simple statement of fact? No need to analyze or interpret it, just acknowledge it as a feeling. Would that feel less embarrassing or more like a neutral observation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying it out loud would feel pretty exposing and embarrassing. Maybe if I whispered it to myself or wrote it on a sticky note and then took two slow breaths it might feel less dramatic, but I'm not great with exercises — can we keep it really simple?

Therapist: Let's start with something even smaller. Can you try taking one deep breath, without doing anything else, just focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body? No words, no thinking, just the breath.

Patient: Okay, I tried — I took one slow breath. It felt weird and kind of exposed, like there was suddenly space for the worry to pop up and then I started thinking about all the unfinished pieces. I don't know, I guess I can try another but can we keep it short? Maybe tell me one tiny thing I could do when I'm at the studio and panicking.

Therapist: When you feel that initial sense of panic, what's one tiny physical action you can do with your hands, like tapping your foot or stretching your arms?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could do something tiny — like make one single mark on the canvas, or roll a little stone or stress ball in my hand for ten seconds. That feels less like committing to the whole project, y'know. Can we talk about how to make that feel like progress instead of just stalling?

Therapist: That's a great starting point – taking that one mark on the canvas or rolling the stress ball. When you do it, what would you like to happen next, not in terms of what you're doing, but in terms of how you want to feel?

Patient: I guess I'd want to feel a little lighter — like the tightness in my chest loosened and I wasn't immediately beating myself up. I don't know, maybe a tiny bit proud or like I actually did something useful instead of just stalling. But I worry it'll feel fake and I'll slip back into avoiding.

Therapist: Let's try to reframe the "proud" feeling. Instead of "I'm proud that I didn't completely avoid it," what if you told yourself "I showed up and took a small step, which means I'm taking care of myself and my art"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds nicer, like something I'd want to actually believe. But it also feels kind of fake and embarrassing to say out loud to myself — like I'm trying to trick myself into feeling better. Maybe if I wrote it on a sticky note and left it by the canvas after making that one mark, it'd start to feel more real. Can we try that idea or something else if it still feels off?

Therapist: Writing it down on a sticky note can be a helpful way to anchor the feeling. What if, after making that one mark, you wrote down just one sentence that feels true to you, like "I did something creative today" or "I'm taking care of myself"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try writing one sentence after that single mark — something small like "I did something creative today." It still feels weird and a bit fake to praise myself, but maybe seeing it later would anchor the moment. If I still slide back into avoiding, can we talk about a follow-up step that doesn't feel like more pressure?

Therapist: After writing the sentence, what if you simply turned your attention to the next task, whatever that might be – clean your brushes, check your materials, or take a short break?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that could help — shifting to something small like cleaning brushes or checking materials feels less scary than facing the whole piece. But a lot of times those little tasks turn into avoiding the work altogether, so maybe a follow-up could be something time-limited, like “do this for 10 minutes, then check in and decide next.” Can we try thinking through what that 10-minute check-in might actually sound like so it doesn't feel like more pressure?

Therapist: Let's break down what the 10-minute check-in might look like. Instead of "I'll check in and decide what to do next," what if you simply asked yourself "What's the smallest, most tiny thing I can do next, right now, in the next 10 minutes?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess the tiniest thing would be making one quick mark or a five-minute sketch in the corner of the canvas. Then at the 10-minute check-in I could just ask myself, "Do I want to keep going for another 10 minutes?" — nothing about judging how good it is, because that feels huge. I'm nervous it'll still fall apart, so can we keep the check-in wording really neutral like that?

Therapist: Using the phrase "Do I want to keep going for another 10 minutes" seems like a great way to keep the check-in neutral. Would you feel more comfortable with that, or would you like to tweak it slightly, like "Do I want to take a break or keep working for a bit longer?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess the "take a break or keep working for a bit longer" one feels safer — it gives me permission to stop instead of making it sound like failure. Maybe tweak it to "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes, or would a short break help me come back fresher?" But I'm nervous it'll still feel like more pressure.

Therapist: Let's keep the revised check-in phrase, but try to simplify it further. Instead of "help me come back fresher," what if you simply asked "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes, or would a break feel good right now?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess that sounds simpler and less pressuring. I could try asking myself, "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes, or would a break feel good right now?" but I'm worried I'll just choose the break every time and convince myself it's progress — can we add a tiny guardrail so breaks don't turn into full avoidance?

Therapist: Let's add a tiny caveat to the break option. What if, instead of just asking "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes or take a break?", you asked "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes, or do I need a break to recharge and come back to this?"

Patient: I don't know... I guess that actually sounds safer, less like failing. But I'm worried I'll pick "break to recharge" and it just becomes me avoiding — maybe the break needs a tiny rule, like a 15-minute timer and a specific thing to do (walk outside, make tea, stretch) so it's actually recharging. Can we pick one small break action that feels doable in the studio?

Therapist: Let's choose a small, studio-friendly break action. What if, after taking a break, you simply made a small mark on the canvas, like a dot or a small scribble, as a way to signal to yourself that you took a break and are ready to return to the work?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that could actually help — putting a tiny dot after a break might make it feel like I'm coming back without having to dive into the whole piece. It's a little embarrassing to have a ritual, but maybe if I pick a quiet corner or a specific color it won't feel so exposed. I'm still nervous I'll use breaks to hide, though — can we keep the 15-minute timer rule and maybe decide on one tiny thing to do for the first 10 minutes after the dot so it's not just symbolic?

Therapist: Let's keep the 15-minute timer rule and choose a specific, low-stakes activity for the first 10 minutes after the dot. How about "Do I want to keep working for another 10 minutes, or do I need to water my plants"? The gentle, automatic action of watering plants can serve as a calming and restorative break, while keeping the timer and checking in with yourself afterwards will help you stay on track.

Patient: I don't know... I guess the plant idea actually sounds kind of gentle and doable, like something I wouldn't feel too dumb doing. The 15-minute timer, a tiny dot after the break, and then maybe a five-minute sketch or one quick line in the corner sounds okay — feels less like deciding whether I'm failing. I'm still nervous I'll turn the break into hiding, though — how would you suggest I set this up in the studio so the dot-and-return part actually happens?

Therapist: Let's create a small, physical anchor for the dot-and-return system. Would you be willing to place a small sticker or a tiny, non-descript label on the wall or a nearby surface, with the words "Break Time" or something similarly simple? Then, after your 15-minute break, when you come back to your work, you can place the sticker or label on the canvas as a visual reminder that you've returned to the task, and then do your 5-minute sketch or quick line.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try that. It feels a bit silly and embarrassing, but maybe a tiny, neutral sticker in the corner of my easel would remind me without making me feel exposed. I'm worried I'll forget to move it back or that it'll feel childish—if it doesn't work, can we pick a backup tiny cue so I don't just drop the whole thing?

Therapist: Let's create a backup cue that's just as simple and non-descript. Instead of a sticker, what about a small, almost imperceptible movement – like tapping the bristles of your brush against the canvas, or making a tiny, almost imperceptible mark with your finger? This way, you can still acknowledge the end of the break without drawing attention to it, and then return to your work.

Patient: I don't know... I guess tapping the bristles sounds less obvious than the sticker, so I might try that. It still feels silly and I'm worried I'll just do the motion and then wander off when the anxiety hits. Could we keep the 15-minute timer and make a rule that after the tap I do a 5-minute sketch or one quick line so it actually pulls me back? Talking about this makes me nervous, but I want something that might actually stick.

Therapist: Let's combine the 15-minute timer with a clear and specific rule for what happens after the tap. Instead of just "do a 5-minute sketch or one quick line," what if you say to yourself "As soon as I tap, I will make a mark on the canvas that I am proud of, even if it's just a tiny line or a small shape"? This way, you're setting a clear expectation for yourself and giving yourself permission to create something, even if it's just a small, imperfect mark.

Patient: I don't know... I guess that could help, but the word "proud" makes my chest tighten — it feels like another performance measure. Maybe change it to something softer like "a mark I allowed myself to make" or "a mark I notice" so it doesn't feel like proving anything. I can try the tap + 15-minute timer with that, but I'm nervous it'll still feel silly and I'll bail.

Therapist: Let's use the revised phrase "a mark I notice" instead of "proud". This way, you're acknowledging the mark without judgment or evaluation. Would you be willing to start with this revised system and see how it feels, rather than trying to perfect the language or abandon the whole approach?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that. "A mark I notice" feels less like proving anything, so the 15-minute timer, tap, then that tiny mark + a 5-minute sketch seems doable. I'm nervous it'll still feel silly and I'll bail — can we plan a really short check-in next time so I don't feel like I'm doing this all alone?

Therapist: Let's plan a very brief check-in, just 1-2 questions, to make it feel less overwhelming. How about this: "How did the tap-and-mark system work for you today?" and "What did you notice about your body or emotions when you made the mark and then started sketching?" This way, you can get feedback on your progress without feeling like you're committing to a long, in-depth analysis.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — answer those two questions very briefly after I use the tap-and-mark today. I'm nervous it'll feel exposing, so can we limit it to one sentence each? If I end up bailing, I might just say "I couldn't" — is that okay to report? I don't know, I'm not great at this, but I want to try.

Therapist: It's completely okay to report that you couldn't make it work if that's what happens. Your honesty will be what matters, not the label you put on it. You can simply say "I couldn't" and then reflect on what might have happened next time, without beating yourself up over it.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — answer those two questions in one sentence each. I'm nervous it'll feel exposing, so if I bail I might just say "I couldn't" and maybe add one small word about how I felt, like "overwhelmed." I don't know... I guess having that option makes it a bit less terrifying, can we start there?

Therapist: That sounds like a good starting point. Let's aim to simply say "I couldn't" and "overwhelmed" when you bail, and then explore what might have happened next time together.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — answer those two questions in one sentence each, and if I bail I'll say "I couldn't" and "overwhelmed." I don't know... I'm nervous, but having that out feels a bit safer. How often do you want me to do the check-in — after each studio session, or like once a week? I guess I'd prefer something not too frequent so it doesn't start to feel like more pressure.

Therapist: Let's aim to do the check-in after each studio session, rather than weekly. This way, you'll have a chance to reflect on your progress and adjust your approach as needed, without feeling like you're committing to a long-term obligation.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try doing the check-in after each session, but I'm nervous it'll feel like extra pressure. Can we keep it exactly those two one-sentence answers and let me skip if a session was a total wash? Talking about this still makes me feel exposed, so I might stumble over it.

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. Just say "I couldn't" and "overwhelmed" when you bail, and we'll skip the check-in altogether.

Patient: I don't know... I guess skipping the check-in sounds like less pressure, but it also makes me worried I'll just hide from it and never notice a pattern. Can we at least agree I'll try the tap-and-mark with the 15-minute timer for a few sessions and give one short sentence update next time about whether it worked? I'm nervous, but I want to try.

Therapist: Sounds like a great compromise. Let's commit to trying the tap-and-mark system for 3-4 sessions, and then we'll reassess and see how it's going. You can simply say "it didn't work" or "I couldn't" and we'll explore what might have gone wrong next time.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — I'll do the tap-and-mark with the 15-minute timer for the next three studio sessions. I'm nervous it'll feel exposing, so can we stick to that one-sentence update afterward like we agreed? If I forget in the moment, is it okay to jot the one-sentence note at the end of the day instead of stopping what I'm doing?
