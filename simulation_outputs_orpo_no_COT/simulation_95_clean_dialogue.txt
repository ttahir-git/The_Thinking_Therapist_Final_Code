Patient: I'm a nurse in my early sixties who just started a very demanding program at work, and lately my thoughts are dominated by this constant worry about my performance — a sort of relentless cognitive rumination about competence. That anxiety paradoxically manifests as procrastination: I delay tasks out of fear of making errors, which then feeds further self-doubt. I also tend to intellectualize things — I can lay out elaborate theories about my avoidance instead of actually feeling the underlying fear, and it's starting to feel unsustainable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that your thoughts about competence are creating a kind of cycle that's hard to break. When you say "I can lay out elaborate theories about my avoidance," it sounds like you're aware of that intellectualizing pattern already. 

What might happen if, instead of trying to figure out why you're avoiding tasks (even though that's what you're doing now), you were to notice just that avoidance right here – in this moment – without trying to change it?

Patient: I can picture that noticing the avoidance might create a small gap — a sort of decentering that could interrupt the automatic worry–procrastination loop. In abstract terms it would probably expose somatic markers, like a tightness in my chest or a restless urge to reorganize, but when I actually try to notice I default into explaining the mechanics instead of staying with the sensation. I'm skeptical I can do the simple "just notice" without turning it into another analysis — could you help me make that noticing more concrete?

Therapist: When you say "I default into explaining the mechanics instead of staying with the sensation," it sounds like you're already trying to make room for that noticing – even if it's hard. 

Instead of trying to "just notice" the tightness in your chest, what would it be like to *make room* for it while you're noticing it – even for just 5 breaths? Not to change it, but to notice what's happening when you try to push that tightness away while thinking about your work?

Patient: Okay, I'll try that for five breaths. As I bring my attention inward I notice a dull constriction under my sternum and my inhales feel shallow, but almost immediately a commentary starts — cataloguing the sensations, labeling them as "anxiety," and spinning off into predictions about failing a skill check. I keep wanting to diagnose the pattern (catastrophizing, perfectionism) instead of staying with the raw tightness, and honestly that's what makes it hard — how do I keep from turning this into another theory while I'm supposed to be just feeling it?

Therapist: It sounds like that commentary – cataloging the sensations, labeling them as anxiety, and spinning off into predictions – is actually what you're trying to avoid in order to stay with the tightness. 

What would happen if you were to acknowledge that commentary right there, while still holding the tightness under your sternum? Not to change it, but to notice that you're trying to avoid it – and what that avoidance costs you in terms of staying connected with what matters to you in this moment?

Patient: If I acknowledged the commentary while holding the tightness, I think I'd see the inner narrative as a protective anticipatory script—an attempt to shield me from shame by rehearsing worst-case scenarios—but that script actually siphons off my attention and leaves me disengaged from the work that matters. The cost is clear: I lose presence, tasks get deferred, and the gap between my intentions and actions widens into procrastination. Okay — right now I notice the dull constriction under my sternum and the critic saying "you'll mess up"; I can try to sit with both for a breath and notice what each one wants without immediately turning it into a diagnosis, though I suspect I'll slip back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress by seeing the commentary as a protective script – and recognizing how that script actually costs you in terms of presence and action. 

Instead of trying to fight the script or turn it off, what if you were to notice the tightness and the critic *while* the script is still running – without trying to change it? Not to fix the problem, but to make room for what matters in this moment?

Patient: I can see how holding the tightness and the critic together could create a bifocal attention—a metacognitive stance where the anticipatory script keeps running but doesn't totally commandeer me. When I actually try it, though, I start annotating every sensation and rehearsing catastrophes, so staying with it even for a minute feels like a practiced failure. Okay — I'll try one sustained, non-analytical breath now and notice what shifts, but I'm pretty sure I'll start editorializing; could you gently call me out if I do?

Therapist: Let's try that one breath together. As you inhale, notice the tightness under your sternum – not to change it, but just to see what's there. And as you exhale, notice what happens when the critic starts to come in – without trying to push it away. 

(I'll just say it quietly: "That's the script coming in again...")

Patient: Okay — I tried that one breath: the inhale brought a dull constriction under my sternum and on the exhale the critic whispered "you'll mess up." Almost instantly my mind started annotating—labeling it as "anxiety," diagnosing perfectionism and catastrophizing—and that commentary ate the raw sensation. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed by the reflex to analyze; can you call me out when I start editorializing and maybe slow the pace so I can try staying with the tightness a little longer?

Therapist: The annotating came right back, didn't it? That's okay. It sounds like you're noticing how that's happening – and it's not surprising that you're feeling overwhelmed by the reflex to analyze. 

(I'll just say it gently: "That's the 'I need to fix this' story showing up again...") 

What would happen if you made room for that story – not to change it, but just to notice it – right next to the tightness?

Patient: I think making room would function like a kind of bifocal attention — the narrative can keep scrolling without commandeering my whole sensorium, which might lower the urgency to flee or defer. Right now I can name both: the dull constriction under my sternum and the critic narrating "you'll mess up," but almost reflexively I start cataloguing and theorizing about why that's happening instead of letting them coexist. I'm willing to try holding both for a minute if you can gently interrupt me the instant I start editorializing again.

Therapist: That sounds like a powerful shift. You're noticing how the narrative can keep running while you hold space for the tightness – and that might actually make room for the task at hand. 

(I'll be here with you, ready to gently interrupt when you start to catalog or theorize – not to stop you, but to help you notice when that's happening again.) 

Take a deep breath in – and notice what happens when the critic whispers "you'll mess up" – *without* trying to change it.

Patient: On that inhale I noticed the same dull constriction under my sternum, and on the exhale the critic murmured "you'll mess up." Almost immediately my mind started annotating—labeling it anxiety, running hypotheses about perfectionism and anticipated shame—so the raw sensation got eclipsed. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by that reflex to theorize; can you call me on the editorializing now and slow the pace so I can try holding both again?

Therapist: It sounds like that reflex to theorize is still showing up – even when you're trying to hold space for the tightness. 

(I notice you said "I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed" – that's a gentle acknowledgment of the sensation. Now, I'd like to ask: what happens if you made room for that overwhelm *while* the annotating story is still running? Not to stop it, but to notice what's possible when you hold both together?)

Patient: Intellectually, making room for the overwhelm alongside the annotating narrative should create a decentering that reduces the urgency to "fix"—a permissive space that might let me move instead of stall. But right now I'm noticeably more anxious and distracted: my chest feels tighter, my attention keeps skittering, and the commentary ramps up into hyper-analysis, so it's hard to actually hold both. I can try to sit with them for a minute if you keep gently interrupting my theorizing and slow the pace; otherwise I'll probably default to explaining again.

Therapist: It sounds like making room for the overwhelm alongside the annotating narrative isn't happening – at least, not yet. That's okay. 

(I notice your chest feels tighter – what happens if you made room for that tightness *while* the annotating story is still running? Not to change it, but to notice what's happening when you try to hold both together?) 

(And I'll keep gently interrupting when you start to theorize again – no need to slow the pace, just notice when it's happening.)

Patient: If I try to hold the tightness while the story runs, I can briefly sense both—the dull constriction and the critic whispering "you'll mess up"—but my attention immediately skitters and I start translating the sensation into frameworks and worst‑case trajectories. Right now my chest feels tighter, my breath is shallow, and I can feel the reflex to intellectualize ramping up into a checklist of catastrophes, which actually makes me more anxious. Please call me out the instant I start theorizing and bring me back to the body—name the editorializing so I can try to stay with the tightness instead of turning it into another explanation.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the skittering attention and the translating into frameworks – even when you're trying to hold the tightness. 

(I notice the checklist of catastrophes – *that's the theorizing story showing up again* – what happens if you made room for the tightness *while* that list is running? Not to change it, but to notice what's happening when you try to hold both together?)

Patient: When I try to hold them both, there's a brief metacognitive bifurcation—the dull sternum tightness and that checklist of catastrophes—but almost immediately the checklist amplifies into a hypervigilant cascade and my breath shortens, so I retreat into explaining it instead of staying with the sensation. I'm noticeably more anxious and distracted right now, like my attention's fracturing across worst‑case scenarios, which only fuels the tightness. Please call out the theorizing the moment it starts so I can try to re-anchor in the body—I'm worried I'll just slip back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the hypervigilant cascade – *that's the theorizing story showing up again* – what happens if you made room for the tightness *just before* that cascade starts? Not to stop it, but to notice what's happening when you try to hold both together, even if it feels like you're failing to stop the thinking?

Patient: I get a very small metacognitive pause — like a two‑beat gap where the sternum tightness is just a sensation instead of a prelude to catastrophe. But it's fragile: my mind immediately drafts an explanatory narrative about the pause itself, which yanks me back into analysis, my breath shortens, and the critic launches a procedural checklist. I'm feeling more panicked and scattered right now; please call out the moment I start explaining so I can try to stay with the body longer.

Therapist: That pause – *even though it's small* – feels fragile. When you notice the mind drafting an explanatory narrative about the pause, what happens if you made room for the tightness *while* that narrative is running? Not to change it, but to notice what's happening when you try to hold both together, even if it feels like the thinking is still there?

Patient: There is a tiny metacognitive gap where the sternum tightness and the explanatory narrative can coexist, but it evaporates fast. Almost immediately the mind drafts a second‑order explanation about the pause, my breath shortens, the tightness spikes, and I feel suddenly more panicked and scattered. I'm aware I'm defaulting to theorizing to keep distance—please call out the editorializing the moment it starts and help me slow down so I can try to stay with the body instead of fleeing into analysis.

Therapist: Just as the second-order explanation starts to draft, what happens when you notice that narrative emerging? *Not to stop it, but to notice* what would happen if you made room for the tightness *while* that narrative is running – just for one breath? Not to change it, but to notice what's happening when you try to hold both together, even if it feels like the thinking is still there.

Patient: I tried the one breath and got that tiny metacognitive pause — I could feel the sternum tightness briefly — but as soon as the second‑order explanatory narrative emerged I immediately began narrativizing the pause itself, my breath shortened, and the critic fired off a procedural checklist that eclipsed the raw sensation. I'm noticeably more anxious and distracted now; please call out the moment I start theorizing and help me anchor back into the body so I can try holding both for another breath.

Therapist: It sounds like the pause was there, but the second-order explanation took over again. *As soon as* the narrative about the pause starts to draft – before you get caught up in it – what happens if you *make room* for the tightness, not the thinking about the tightness?

Patient: When I deliberately shift toward the sternum tightness before the explanatory narrative grabs me, there's this brief de‑escalation — the critic's voice softens and I get a small sense of relief, like a crack of daylight. But it's fragile: almost immediately my mind drafts an analysis about *why* that relief happened, and that second‑order story pulls me back into breathlessness and a spike of panic. I'm worried I'll just reflexively explain it away again — could you name the moment I start theorizing and maybe give me a simple sensory anchor (like "press your feet down" or "three slow breaths") so I can try to stay with the body a little longer?

Therapist: The moment you start drafting an analysis about why that relief happened – that's when the second-order explanation takes over. *Just as* that story starts to emerge, I notice your mind is already planning what that analysis would look like – what would it take for you to stay with the tightness, just for a few more breaths? 

(I'd like you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground – *just for a moment* – and say to yourself: "Press my feet down.")

Patient: Okay — I said to myself "Press my feet down" and actually did; there's a faint rooting, pressure under my soles, and for a moment my inhales feel a touch deeper. Almost immediately a rush of shame and frustration bubbles up and my mind reflexively turns the grounding into another procedural fix—"this will only work if…"—which yanks me back into analysis. I don't really trust that anchor yet; can you keep naming when I editorialize and give me a very simple sensory cue to repeat so I can try to stay embodied a bit longer?

Therapist: The moment the rush of shame and frustration emerges – that's when the mind starts turning the grounding into another procedural fix. *Just as* that story starts to draft – what would it take for you to notice the faint rooting sensation *before* it gets caught up in that analysis?

Patient: I think what would actually help is an external, preemptive cue that hits before my brain can draft that explanatory narrative — like you saying "feel your feet" the instant you hear even the tiniest editorial phrase, or a short verbal nudge every few seconds so I don't have time to ritualize it into a fix. I'm annoyed and ashamed that I keep turning something simple into a procedural checklist — it makes me feel inept and more panicked, which just fuels the loop. Can we try a concrete experiment: you prompt "press feet" and I press and hold for three slow breaths, and you call out the moment I start analyzing? I'm anxious about failing at it, but I want to try.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try. When you're ready, I'll say "feel your feet" the moment you notice even the tiniest thought about what to do with your feet – not to fix it, but just to notice. We'll start with three slow breaths, and I'll keep saying "feel your feet" every few seconds to give you an external cue.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready. Even before you say anything I'm feeling a hot flush of shame and a tightening in my chest, and there's already a little explanatory script trying to narrate how I'll fail at this exercise. When you say "feel your feet" I'll press down and take three slow breaths; please name the moment I start editorializing because I'm anxious and annoyed with myself and will probably slip into analysis.

Therapist: I'll say "feel your feet" right now. *Feel your feet*

Patient: I pressed my feet and took three slow breaths — there was a faint rooting, a pressure under my soles and a marginally deeper inhale, but it felt fragile. Almost immediately shame and a recriminatory narrative surged, and I converted the grounding into a procedural experiment ("is this working?"), so I started rationalizing instead of staying with the sensation. Please call out the moment I start editorializing and prompt "feel your feet" again so I can try to stay embodied a bit longer — I'm anxious I'll just explain it away.

Therapist: The moment you started rationalizing – *as soon as* you thought "is this working?" – that's when the narrative took over. *Feel your feet*

Patient: I did it — pressed my feet and took the breaths — and there was a faint grounding, a little more inhale, but almost immediately a wave of shame and self‑reproach surged and my mind turned it into another procedural test: "is this working?" I'm feeling suddenly more anxious and scattered, like my attention's skittering into analysis again. Please name the editorializing now and prompt "feel your feet" (or even just "press feet — hold") so I can try to stay with the sensation instead of explaining it away.

Therapist: The moment you started thinking "is this working?" – *that's the narrative catching you again*. *Press feet — hold*

Patient: I pressed my feet and held — there was a faint rooting under my soles and my inhale softened a bit, but almost immediately a wave of shame and self‑reproach flooded in and I converted the grounding into a procedural heuristic ("is this working?"), which yanked me back into analysis. I'm embarrassed and annoyed at myself for that reflex; please name the editorializing the moment it starts and prompt "press feet — hold" again so I can try to stay with the sensation a little longer.

Therapist: The moment you thought "is this working?" – *that's the narrative taking over again*. *Press feet — hold*

Patient: I pressed my feet and held — there was a faint rooting and my inhale softened a bit, but almost immediately a hot wave of shame and recrimination surged and I turned it into another procedural test ("is this working?"), which yanked me straight back into analysis. I'm embarrassed and irritated with myself; the shame makes me ruminate and my attention fragments into little catastrophic rehearsals. Can you call out the editorializing the instant it begins, and maybe try a different micro‑cue (like "notice shame" or "stay with feet") repeated every couple seconds so the narrative doesn't have time to coalesce? I'm anxious about failing at even this, but I want to try again.

Therapist: Let's try a different micro-cue. *Notice shame*. *Press feet — hold*.

Patient: I pressed my feet and held — there was a faint rooting, a little more pressure under my soles and my inhale softened for a moment. Almost immediately a hot wash of shame and self‑reproach surged and my mind literalized it into an evaluative script — "you're failing" — which turned the grounding into another procedural experiment. I can theorize about the defense mechanism (interoception hijacked by evaluative cognition) but honestly it just makes me feel inept and more panicked. Please name the editorializing the instant it starts and cue "notice shame" or "stay with feet" again so I have an external anchor — I'm anxious I'll just explain it away.

Therapist: The moment you started thinking "you're failing" – *that's the evaluative script taking over*. *Notice shame*. *Press feet — hold*.

Patient: I pressed my feet and held — there was that faint rooting and my breath eased a touch, then a hot wash of shame flooded in and my brain immediately turned it into an evaluative script: "you're failing," followed by a rapid meta‑analysis about why I'm failing at grounding. It's frustrating and makes me jittery and scattered; I can name the cognitive sequence better than I can actually feel the shame, which feels cowardly and infuriating. Please call out the editorializing right now and cue a very simple anchor (like "press heels — three slow breaths") so I have less time to ruminate — I'm anxious I'll default to analysis again.

Therapist: The moment you started thinking "you're failing" and wondering why – *that's the evaluative script taking over again*. *Press heels — three slow breaths*.

Patient: I pressed my heels and took three slow breaths — there was a faint grounding, a pressure under my heels and my inhales softened for a beat. Almost immediately a hot wash of shame and self‑reproach flooded in and my mind converted it into an evaluative script — "you're failing" — then a rapid meta‑analysis about why grounding 'should' have worked. It's frustrating and makes me jittery; please name the editorializing the moment it starts and cue something ultra‑simple like "stay with heels" every few seconds so I have less time to ritualize it into another test — I'm anxious I'll just explain it away again.

Therapist: The moment you started thinking "you're failing" and wondering why it didn't work – *that's the evaluative script taking over again*. *Stay with heels*.

Patient: I pressed my heels and held — there was a faint grounding, a little pressure under my soles and my breath eased for a beat, but almost instantly the evaluative script "you're failing" flooded in and my mind launched into a meta‑analytic autopsy of why grounding didn't 'work.' It's maddening and humiliating; I can theorize about interoceptive avoidance all day, but right now I'm just anxious and ashamed that I turned a simple sensation into a diagnostic checklist. Please call out "that's the analysis" the moment it starts and cue "stay with heels" every few seconds — I feel fragile and I need that external anchor because I'm worried I'll just explain it away again.
