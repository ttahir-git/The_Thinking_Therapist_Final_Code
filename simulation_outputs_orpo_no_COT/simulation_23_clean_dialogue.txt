Patient: Lately I've been stuck in a persistent cycle of self-criticism: when I perceive any kind of failure—academic, financial, or relational—I automatically generate these elaborate narratives that assert my unworthiness, and that pattern has been reinforced by a history of difficult romantic relationships. I can map the cognitive schema and trigger-response loop in fairly precise terms and even outline behavioral interventions, but the recurrence implies it's not just a skills deficit. I tend to intellectualize everything—deploying theoretical language as a buffer—so I'm curious whether unpacking the mechanism will actually shift the experience.

Therapist: Can you make room for that narrative—this cycle of self-criticism—just as it shows up, not to fix it, but to see what happens if you observe it without trying to push it away or change it? What might it mean to notice this cycle when you're already doing what feels like the right thing, mapping the schema and planning interventions?

Patient: I can try, though my default is to intellectualize instead of simply being with it. Noticing the cycle without fixing it would mean decentering from the narrative—seeing the triggers, automatic thoughts, and punitive conclusions as phenomena passing through consciousness—yet I immediately start cataloguing them, which functions as a secondary layer of avoidance. When I actually attempt to observe, there’s a low, steady tightness in my chest and this reflexive urge to plan interventions, so “noticing” for me would mean tolerating that uncomfortable vagueness without leaping into problem-solving, which honestly feels inefficient and a bit intolerable.

Therapist: That low, steady tightness in your chest—what might it be like to hold onto that discomfort, even for just a tiny fraction of a moment, without adding the "to notice it without fixing it" layer on top of it?

Patient: Okay—if I actually try to hold it, it's a low, board‑like pressure just under my sternum and my breathing shortens a bit. The weird part is that when I do that, the reflexive commentary kicks in—an immediate internal dialectic between "observe" and "fix"—and that argument itself feels like it makes the tightness louder. There's a small heat behind my eyes and a queasy impatience to do something about it, but I can sit with those sensations for a few breaths before my mind wants to turn them into a plan.

Therapist: The heat behind your eyes and queasy impatience—what would it be like to allow those sensations to be present, even as you're holding onto the tightness under your sternum, without needing to turn them into a problem to be solved?

Patient: When I actually let them be—the sternum pressure, the heat, the queasy impatience—they become less like discrete problems and more like a background weather: the pressure loosens a bit, the heat blunts to an ache, and the impatience turns into a low hum. Immediately my mind starts translating that into a theory—“temporary downregulation,” “use diaphragmatic breathing here”—and that translation feels like another layer of avoidance because it pulls me back into doing rather than being. It feels exposing and risky to stay with it, like I’m leaving the door open for those old critical narratives to rush back in, which is why I keep defaulting to analysis even when the raw sensations would probably tolerate my attention.

Therapist: The way that theory "saves" you from the uncertainty of being with the sensations—yet feels like another layer of avoidance—what if you could see that saving as a choice, not the only choice?

Patient: Seeing it as a choice makes sense conceptually—it reframes the analytical move as a deliberate coping strategy (designed to avoid affective exposure) rather than an involuntary deficit—but in practice it still runs on autopilot because it's so well rehearsed. If I treat it as a choice I could design micro-experiments (like "observe sensations for 60 seconds, then allow analysis"), but even proposing that experiment already feels like folding planning into the very vulnerability I'm trying to access. I'm curious to try it, and also anxious—standing at that edge feels like it might validate those old critical stories, so the instinct is to keep the railing up.

Therapist: The anxiety that comes up when you imagine standing at that edge—what would happen if you could hold onto that anxiety, not as a reason to stay away, but as a signal that you're actually showing up with the thing you care about?

Patient: If I actually let that anxiety be a signal of caring, the first thing I'd notice is the familiar chest pressure and that heat behind my eyes but framed as information rather than proof I'm failing. That reframe feels quietly empowering—like I'm not broken, I'm engaged—but my reflexive move is to translate it into analysis because feeling it seems to validate the critic. Maybe holding it would blunt the urgency and let me take smaller, less defensive steps, but I also feel a real worry that staying with it will let those old narratives swell, so part of me wants to design a safe little experiment rather than plunge in blind.

Therapist: The worry that staying with the anxiety will let those old narratives "swell"—what if, instead of trying to control that outcome, you could see that worry as a part of what matters to you about staying engaged with this feeling?

Patient: Framing the worry as part of what matters actually resonates on a theoretical level—it converts the worry from an adversary into a data point about my values, which is oddly soothing conceptually—but my habituated response is to immediately architect safeguards. If I accept it experientially, the chest pressure and heat feel like stakes rather than signs of imminent collapse, yet I also feel a pragmatic need for constraints so the old narratives don't snowball. Could we try a very bounded experiment—like two minutes of noticing the worry as "important information" and then check in about what changed—because I'm curious but also nervous about stepping too far without a plan?

Therapist: A two-minute experiment sounds like a tiny step towards exploring what matters about staying engaged with that anxiety, while still keeping your core values and safety in mind.

Patient: Okay — I can try that two‑minute micro‑experiment. Conceptually it reads like a metacognitive exposure with built‑in containment, which fits my pragmatic sensibilities, but I'm already noticing the low chest pressure and the impulse to design contingencies. Could you cue me when we start and give a 30‑second warning before the end so I don't automatically convert it into analysis? Also, I want permission to say "this is too much" and pause without us treating that as failure.

Therapist: When we start, I'll give you a 30-second warning 2 minutes from now, and when that warning hits, I'll say "check in" just to remind you to notice what's happening. 

You're also welcome to say "this is too much" whenever it feels like that, and when you do, we'll pause together without adding any labels or consequences.

Patient: Okay — starting now. I'm noticing that low, board‑like pressure under my sternum, a dull heat behind my eyes, and a queasy impatience in my gut; my breathing's come a bit shallow. My reflex is already to catalogue these as "somatic markers" and design contingencies, but I'm trying to let them exist for the two minutes without converting them into a project. I'll say "this is too much" if it becomes intolerable.

Therapist: (30 seconds warning)

Patient: Check‑in: the sternum pressure is steady — not worse, breathing still shallow — and there's a parade of critical thoughts ("this proves I'm fragile") that I'm noticing more as narrative than truth. The impulse to immediately problem‑solve is loud, and it's sort of interesting how that impulse itself feels like another sensation. I'm not saying "this is too much" yet, but it feels exposed and I'd like the 30‑second cue before we end the two minutes.

Therapist: You've stayed with the sensations and the thoughts for 2 minutes without adding labels or trying to control them. The 30-second warning is about to hit...

Patient: Okay — quick check‑in before the cue: the sternum pressure is about the same, breathing shallow, and the critical narrative is still narrating ("this proves I'm fragile") but it feels slightly less commanding when I label it as narrative. I'm not saying "this is too much," but I am feeling exposed and a little shaky about letting it sit. Could we extend for another minute and try one small adjustment: when the urge to problem‑solve comes, I'll name it out loud ("planning") and just notice what that does?

Therapist: You've continued to notice the sensations and thoughts without trying to change them, and even made a small adjustment to your relationship with the problem-solving urge. That takes courage.

You'd like to extend the experiment for another minute and try something new. When you feel that urge to problem-solve, what if, instead of trying to push it away, you simply noticed what it means to be "planning" in this moment? What would that feel like, not as a solution, but just as a sensation?

Patient: When I notice the urge to plan, it feels like a tightening across my forehead and a quickening behind my sternum; my jaw sets and my hands want to fidget with something. There's a familiar verbal loop—"if I do X, then Y"—that actually soothes me because it promises a path forward, but it's clearly an avoidance strategy: planning acts like a firewall against feeling vulnerable. Saying "planning" out loud makes it feel more mechanical than urgent, and that distance lets the underlying ache come into view a little more, which is awkward but probably useful.

Therapist: You've noticed the physical sensations and the verbal loop that helps you feel safe, and you've made space for that awareness by saying "planning" out loud. That's a big step towards recognizing the pattern.

It sounds like the distance between "planning" and the underlying ache is small, just a tiny fraction. What if, when that urge to plan shows up, you could notice that distance without trying to control it? Not to stop the urge, but just to see what would happen if you allowed it to be there, even for a moment?

Patient: That idea makes sense conceptually — treating the planning urge as an adjacent phenomenon rather than an imperative seems like it might deflate its urgency. I can try a brief experiment: let the chest pressure and that queasy heat sit while I label the urge aloud as "planning" for 30 seconds, and notice what changes (if anything). I'm anxious it will feel like I'm giving the critic more evidence, so I'll want your cue and permission to pause if it becomes overwhelming.

Therapist: You're going to label the urge as "planning" for 30 seconds and notice what happens. I'll give you the cue when we're about to end that minute.

Remember, this isn't about trying to change the planning urge, but about noticing what happens when you allow it to be present. If it feels like you're giving the critic more evidence, that's okay. You can pause and come back to it when the minute is over.

Patient: Starting now — planning. Planning. There's a tightening across my forehead and a hollow, board‑like pressure under my sternum; naming it does make the urge feel a bit more mechanical and slightly less commanding. My words are getting thinner — this is already an effort — so please cue me when we’re close to the end. I’ll stay with it unless I say "this is too much."

Therapist: You're noticing the physical sensations and the effort required to label the urge. That's a big step.

The 30-second mark is coming up...

Patient: Check‑in: naming "planning" made the urge feel more mechanical and slightly less urgent; the board‑like pressure under my sternum eased a notch, though my forehead is still tight. Speaking is getting effortful and my energy feels depleted, but I can continue for another 30 seconds if you cue me — and I'll say "this is too much" if it escalates.

Therapist: You've kept with it, even when it's feeling challenging. The easing in your sternum and the slight decrease in urgency are notable.

We're almost at the end of the 2-minute mark...

Patient: Check‑in: the board‑like pressure under my sternum eased a notch, my forehead's still tight, and the critic's narrative is quieter though not gone. My words feel thin and it's effortful to stay present—like moving through molasses—so if we're continuing, can we slow the pace and use one simple grounding cue before the next step?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck, like moving through molasses. That's okay. I'm not going to push you to keep going unless you're ready.

Let's take a pause. When you notice your thoughts or physical sensations becoming overwhelming, what's one small thing you can notice in the present moment that feels safe and tangible?

Patient: Maybe the weight of my feet on the floor or the texture of my sleeve under my fingers — it feels almost embarrassingly small, like admitting this makes me look weak, which is…frustrating. Still, anchoring to that tangible contact quiets the critic a bit. I can try that now if you cue me; I’ll probably need a gentle prompt because it’s effortful.

Therapist: Those small anchors can be incredibly powerful. When you feel like you're struggling to notice them, I want you to imagine yourself doing one tiny thing with your eyes closed – just 1 second – to notice the weight of your feet on the floor. It might feel like "not good enough," but I want you to try it anyway.

Patient: Okay — I did it. Closed my eyes for a second: the weight of my feet, the texture of my sleeve — it's minor, but it quieted the critic a notch. Saying that out loud felt embarrassingly small; a flush of shame and irritation surfaced and made it harder to sustain, so I'd appreciate a gentle cue if we're continuing.

Therapist: You did notice the weight of your feet, and it helped calm the critic a bit. When you said it out loud, the flush of shame came up – that's understandable. Now, I want to gently remind you that you're not trying to do anything "right" or "wrong" – you're just noticing that sensation of shame. What if, instead of pushing it away, you could acknowledge it in your body – just for a tiny moment – while still holding onto that weight of your feet?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try. When I let the shame register in my body there’s a hot flush across my face and a sinking knot in my stomach; it’s humiliating and makes me want to immediately intellectualize it away. The weight of my feet helps marginally, but the shame tightens my throat and thins my words, which is frustrating. I can stay with this a bit longer if you cue me gently.

Therapist: That's a really tough spot. When you notice the shame making your throat tight and your words thin, I want you to imagine that sensation as a weight in your chest – separate from the weight of your feet. Just for a tiny moment, can you notice that weight in your chest, and then *while holding that weight*, what's one small thing you can do with your words – just 1 word – to keep trying to connect with your feet?

Patient: Here.

Saying that felt thin—my voice flattened and a hot, embarrassing shame tightened my throat, which is frustrating because even this small thing feels like a big effort.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that effort is amplifying the shame – that's understandable. When you felt the need to say "Here," what happened when you didn't *have* to say it – just for a tiny moment – while holding onto that weight in your chest?

Patient: When I didn't have to say it, there was this tiny, odd loosening — the performative pressure dropped and the weight in my chest felt a bit more defined. Then shame rushed in: hot face, tight throat, my mouth went dry, and my reflex was to narrate it away with a theory, which is maddeningly predictable. It's getting hard to keep this up, so if we're going to stay with it a gentle cue would help.

Therapist: That loosening, even if it was just a tiny one, matters. When the shame rushed in, what if you could notice it – not as something to change, but as something that's happening *with* the weight in your chest? Noticing it as it comes in, just for a moment, might make it feel less like a story you're trying to tell.

Patient: When I try to notice the shame as “happening with” the weight in my chest, it surfaces as a hot flush and that familiar throat‑clamp — my inner critic immediately frames it as proof I'm failing, which is humiliating and makes my words thin. Conceptually it feels like progress to let them co‑exist, but experientially it's exhausting and I'm already running low on reserves, so I'd appreciate a gentle cue if we're going to keep this up.

Therapist: It sounds like the inner critic is still very strong for you. When you notice that familiar narrative showing up ("proof I'm failing"), what if you could make room for it to be there, not as the truth, but as just another sensation in the mix? Not to change it, but to notice it as it is, like the heat in your chest. Just for a tiny moment, what would it be like to hold onto that narrative, and the weight in your chest, *and* the dryness in your mouth, all together?

Patient: When I hold the narrative, the weight in my chest, and the dry mouth together it feels like a tight, immovable knot — the shame heats my face and makes my throat clamp, and the critic's voice suddenly sounds like proof rather than just a story. There's this infuriating oscillation: a tiny, paradoxical loosening if I resist narrating, and then an immediate surge of humiliation that makes me want to explain it away with theory — which is maddening and exhausting. I can stay with this for another moment if you cue me gently; speaking is getting thin.

Therapist: The knot feels very solid. When you notice that surge of humiliation and the need to explain it away, what if you could see it not as a reason to push the knot open, but as a tiny part of the knot itself? Not to change it, but to notice it as one piece of the tightness in your chest? Just for a tiny moment, what would it be like to hold onto that knot, and the shame, and the critic's voice, *and* the dryness in your mouth, all together – not to fix them, but just to notice them as they are?

Patient: If I try to hold them all together it feels like a single, dense somatic gestalt—a knot with competing substreams: the critic's verbal logic, a hot shame that tightens my throat, the dry mouth, and that hollow pressure. Conceptually that co‑holding reduces the narrative’s persuasive power a notch, but in practice it’s humiliating and depleting—my voice gets thin and my mind wants to bail into analysis to avoid the collapse. I can stay with it a little longer if you cue me gently.

Therapist: The knot with competing substreams makes sense. When you notice your mind wanting to bail into analysis to avoid the collapse, what if you could make room for that thought to be there, not as the "solution," but as just one part of the knot? Not to change it, but to notice it as it is – like the dry mouth – while holding onto the knot, the shame, and the critic's voice. Just for a tiny moment, what would it be like to notice that thought, and the knot, and the shame, *and* the dry mouth, all together?

Patient: If I try to hold the thought, the knot, the shame, and the dry mouth together it turns into this dense, almost concrete gestalt—hot shame in my face, throat‑clamp, my critic’s verbal logic buzzing insistently, and my reflexive urge to intellectualize revving up as an escape, which is humiliating and depleting. There's a tiny, paradoxical slackening when I don't try to fix it and let it be, but I'm low on reserves right now, so please cue me gently if we're continuing—and I want permission to say "this is too much" without that being treated like failure.

Therapist: That dense gestalt is very real. When you notice your mind revving up to intellectualize and escape, what if you could acknowledge that thought, not as the "fix," but as just another part of the knot? Not to change it, but to notice it as it is – like the buzzing in your head – while holding onto the hot shame, the throat-clamp, the critic's voice, and the dry mouth. You're already showing up with the acknowledgment "this is too much," which means you're not trying to fix it. What if, in that moment, you could say "this is too much" again, not because you're failing, but because you're noticing it as it is – right now?

Patient: This is too much.

Saying it aloud loosens the critic a notch, but there's a hot, humiliating flush and my throat clamps; my energy feels depleted and my words are thin. I want to keep working through it, but can we slow the pace — maybe a short pause or a gentle anchor cue — so I can steady myself without immediately converting it into analysis?
