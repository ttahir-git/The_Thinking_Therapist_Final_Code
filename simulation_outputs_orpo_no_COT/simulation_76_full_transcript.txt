--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been avoiding friends because social situations fill me with this certainty that something terrible will happen — after my health scare my mind's become a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. If I go to a gathering I'll have a panic attack, someone will notice and judge me, they'll pull away and then my business will suffer — it spirals into ruin every time I imagine it. I mostly handle things on my own, and it's wearing me down.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: That "fortune-telling machine" must be really exhausting for you. When you imagine those social situations spiraling out of control, what happens if you could make room for just one small step towards being with your friends, even if it feels like a tiny crack in that certainty – not to stop the thoughts, but to see what would be possible if you tried that small step anyway?

Patient: I don't see a tiny crack — if I try to go for even an hour, I'll have a panic attack, someone will notice and gossip, clients will lose faith in me, and my business will start to crumble until I'm ruined. Suggesting a small step feels unrealistic — my head already plays that whole collapse on a loop and I can't pretend it won't happen. Honestly, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed just talking about it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the weight of all those "what-ifs" is really pressing down on you. When you say "I'm getting a bit overwhelmed just talking about it," what's happening in your body when you notice that feeling – is it like your chest is tightening, or your mind feels like it's racing?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, my heart pounds and my hands tremble, and I feel dizzy and sick to my stomach — then my mind immediately starts narrating the disaster: panic, someone notices, word spreads, clients pull away. I don't know, it feels like my body is already reacting to the ruin that's been predicted, so talking about "small steps" just makes me more overwhelmed and like it's pointless.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when that "disaster" story shows up – the one about your business crumbling and everyone pulling away – your whole system gets activated in response. And when you notice that tightness in your chest, it's like your mind is trying to protect you from what it feels like might happen. Would you be willing to notice that tightness *while* that story is still there – not to push it away, but just to see what would happen if you could breathe into it a little bit, even when the worst-case scenario feels so clear?

Patient: I can try to notice it, but I'm doubtful — when I focus on the tightness my heart races faster and the catastrophe tape in my head just speeds up. It feels like paying attention makes the ruin more real, not less, and I'm already getting overwhelmed talking about it. I don't see how breathing would change the chain of events; if anything, it just makes the panic louder.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the tightness while the catastrophic story is still there feels like a kind of "betrayal" – like your body is already racing towards the worst-case scenario, and paying attention to the tightness just makes it worse. When you say it feels like "paying attention makes the ruin more real," what would happen if you could see that tightness *as* just a sensation – not as proof that the worst-case scenario is true, but as something that's happening *while* the story is still there?

Patient: I don't think I can see it as "just" a sensation — that tightness feels like the proof my machine spits out that the disaster is already unfolding. If I try to focus on it my heart pounds harder, the catastrophe story speeds up, and I get dizzy and sick. I'm getting overwhelmed talking about it — can we slow down? I can't really imagine a realistic outcome where it doesn't spiral.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to focus on the tightness, it feels like your whole system is already locked into the worst-case scenario. And when you say you can't imagine a realistic outcome where it doesn't spiral, what if we didn't need to imagine that outcome to make sense of what's happening? What if we could just *be with* the tightness and the story, without needing to make sense of it?

Patient: I hear you, but being with the tightness doesn't feel neutral — if I stay with it my panic ramps up and the fortune-telling starts narrating the whole collapse: I faint, someone notices and talks, clients lose trust, my business tanks and I'm left ruined. I feel myself getting overwhelmed just saying that, so can we slow down? I don't see how 'being with it' would stop the chain.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the panic is already moving forward, even when you try to stay with it. When you say you feel overwhelmed just saying that, what happens if we stopped trying to "stop" the chain – not to break the panic, but just to notice where you are when you're feeling that way?

Patient: If I stop trying to stop it, it just feels like I'm watching the first domino fall — my chest tightens, I get lightheaded, and the fortune-telling machine starts narrating the whole collapse: I faint, someone notices, word spreads, clients pull away and I'm finished. Trying to "just notice" makes the panic crank up, not down, and I really can't see how that would help. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice what's happening when you stop trying to stop it feels like you're still caught in the cycle. When you say you're getting overwhelmed, what would happen if you let that feeling be present for just a moment – not to change it, but just to see what would happen if you stayed with it while you said the words "I'm getting overwhelmed"?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to say it. When I say "I'm getting overwhelmed" my chest clamps shut, my breath gets tiny, and the fortune-telling machine kicks into overdrive: I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, my business collapses. Saying the words just makes the panic louder instead of helping, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying those words feels like the panic is already moving forward. When you say "can we slow down?" what would it mean to you to *slow down* right now, while you're feeling that overwhelm – not to stop the panic, but just to notice what would happen if you stayed with it while you said those words?

Patient: Slowing down would mean pausing the racing thoughts and trying to breathe instead of speeding toward the end, but when I try that my chest clamps and the fortune-telling machine just races faster—I faint, someone notices, clients pull out, I'm ruined. Right now if we actually slow I feel the panic get louder, not softer, so I need you to slow the pace — I'm already getting overwhelmed and I don't know how this helps.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the pace of our conversation is already making you feel overwhelmed. I'm going to pause right here. *pause*

Patient: Okay—I appreciate the pause, but I'm already feeling that old shame and it's making my chest clamp and my breathing get tiny. When that happens my fortune-telling machine revs up: I'll faint, someone will notice and gossip, clients will pull out, and my business will collapse. I really need us to slow down because going faster just ramps the panic; I'm overwhelmed and I don't see any other realistic outcome.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: *pause* I'm not going to push us to keep going. I'm just going to sit with you here.

Patient: Okay... thanks for just sitting with me. Even this quiet makes that old shame flare up — my chest tightens and the fortune-telling machine starts its script: I faint, they gossip, clients desert me, my business collapses. It helps that you're not pushing, but I'm still really overwhelmed; can you stay here with me a little longer? I don't know what else to do.


--- Turn 11 ---

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: *I stay seated with you, without adding anything*

Patient: The quiet's almost like its own thing — it lets that old shame crawl back up and my chest clamps so tight I can hardly breathe. My fortune-telling machine doesn't pause either: I faint, somebody notices and gossips, clients pull out, and my business is finished — and I feel stupid and furious at myself for letting it happen. Can you just stay with me a bit longer? Don't try to fix it, I just need you not to hurry.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: *I remain seated, not speaking, just present with you*

Patient: It helps that you're just here, but that old shame crawls up and my chest clamps so tightly I can hardly breathe; my fortune-telling goes full throttle — I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, and my business is done. I'm so embarrassed and furious at myself for letting it get like this, and I can't picture any other outcome. Can you stay with me a bit longer and maybe just say something quiet now and then? I don't want you to fix it, I just need you not to hurry.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: *I slowly take a deep breath in, making room for you to notice it, and then exhale softly, making room for you to stay with the feeling*

Patient: Your breath...that little sound helps, I can feel it a hair's breadth calmer, but then that old shame flickers and my chest clamps so tight I want to scream. The fortune-telling won't shut up: I faint, someone notices and whispers, clients pull out, and my business is ruined — and I'm just left feeling stupid and furious at myself for letting it get this far. Can you keep doing that slow breathing with me? Don't hurry — I need you here, just like this.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *I continue the soft, slow breathing, making room for you to stay with the feeling, without adding anything else*

Patient: That slow breathing helps a little — I can feel it pull the edge off, but then that shame flares and my chest clamps so tight I can't think straight. The fortune-telling machine goes back to its script: I faint, someone notices and whispers, clients pull out, and my business collapses, and I feel useless and furious at myself for letting it happen. I don't want you to fix anything, just keep breathing with me and stay here; if I start holding my breath or speeding up, tell me to breathe.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: *I stay seated with you, making sure to breathe slowly and softly, letting you know that it's okay to breathe when you're ready, and that you don't have to hold your breath or speed up – *pause*

Patient: Okay — I'm matching your breathing, and that tiny rhythm helps, but that old shame keeps sneaking back and my chest clamps so tight the fortune-telling machine screams the whole collapse: I faint, someone notices and whispers, clients pull out, and I'm finished. I'm furious at myself for letting it get this bad and ashamed I can't stop the story, and that just makes the panic louder. Stay with the breathing, please — if I start to speed up or hold my breath, tell me to slow down; I don't want you to fix it, just don't hurry.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: *I keep the slow, soft breathing, noticing when your breathing starts to speed up or hold – *pause*

Patient: Okay... I can feel my breath starting to shallow again — my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and my mind's already yelling the collapse: I faint, somebody notices and gossips, clients bail, my business is finished. That old shame flickers and I get so stupidly furious at myself for slipping into it. Please keep breathing with me and tell me to slow if I speed up — don't try to fix it, just stay steady.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: *I gently notice your chest tightening, and your hands trembling – *slow, soft breath* "Your chest feels tight" – *pause*

Patient: Yes — that's exactly it. My chest clamps, my hands tremble, and my head immediately runs the whole ruin script: I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, and my business is finished. I feel so ashamed and stupid for getting stuck in that story, and it just makes my panic louder. Keep breathing with me and don't hurry — I'm getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: *I make room for your feeling – *slow, soft breath* "You're feeling stuck in that story again" – *pause*

Patient: Yes — I'm stuck in it again. My chest clamps, my breath gets tiny, my hands tremble, and the fortune-telling starts the whole script: I faint, someone notices and whispers, clients pull out, and my business is finished. That old shame and fury about failing sneaks in and just makes everything louder; I'm embarrassed and mad at myself for letting it happen. Keep breathing with me and don't hurry — if I speed up, tell me to slow down.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *I gently notice your chest tightening again – *slow, soft breath* "Your chest is tightening" – *pause* "Would you like to breathe into that tightness for just a moment, even if the story feels like it's still there?"

Patient: Okay — I'll try, but I'm doubtful. When I try to breathe into the tightness my chest clamps harder, my heart races, and that old failure flashes up so I feel ashamed and furious at myself; then the fortune-telling machine screams the whole collapse — I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, and my business is ruined. I'll breathe with you for a moment, but please keep your slow rhythm and tell me to slow if I speed up; I'm already feeling overwhelmed and I don't want you to hurry or try to fix it.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *I keep the slow, soft breathing – *pause* "Your chest feels hard, and your heart is racing. It sounds like the story is still loud" – *pause*

Patient: Yes — it's still loud. My chest feels like a lead weight, my heart's racing, and that shame flares up so the fortune-telling starts yelling the whole collapse: I faint, people gossip, clients pull out, my business is finished. I don't see any realistic alternative, and I'm getting overwhelmed — please keep breathing with me and tell me to slow if I speed up; don't hurry, just stay here a bit longer.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *I stay seated with you – *slow, soft breath* "You're noticing that feeling of overwhelm" – *pause*

Patient: Yes — I can feel it: my chest's tightening, my breath's tiny, my hands tremble, and that old shame flares so my fortune-telling machine screams the whole collapse — I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, my business is finished. I'm embarrassed and furious at myself for getting stuck in it, and that just makes the panic louder. Please keep breathing with me a bit longer and tell me to slow if I speed up; don't hurry or try to fix it, just stay with me.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *I continue the slow, soft breathing – *pause*

Patient: That slow breathing helps a hair — I can feel the edge come off — but then that old shame spikes and my fortune-telling machine starts yelling again: I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, and my business is finished. I'm furious and ashamed at myself for slipping into it, and the panic's getting louder. Please just keep that slow rhythm with me a bit longer — don't try to fix it, and if I speed up tell me to slow down.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *I keep the slow, soft breathing – *pause* "Your chest feels heavy"

Patient: Yeah — it feels like a brick sitting on my ribs. The shame spikes and the fortune-telling jumps right back in: I faint, someone notices and gossips, clients pull out, my business collapses. I'm furious and embarrassed at myself for getting stuck in it — please keep breathing with me and don't hurry; tell me to slow if I start to speed up.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *I stay with you – *slow, soft breath* "Your body feels heavy, and the story is loud"

Patient: Yes — it really does feel heavy, like a brick on my ribs, and the story's blasting so loud I can't ignore it: I'll faint, someone will notice and whisper, clients will lose faith, and my business will fall apart. That memory of failing makes me feel ashamed and furious at myself, which just tightens my chest more. Keep breathing with me and don't hurry — if I start to speed up, tell me to slow down.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *I gently notice the tightening in your chest – *slow, soft breath* "You're holding your breath"

Patient: Yeah — I realize I'm holding my breath. My chest's clamped, that shame flares up and the fortune-telling's already shouting the collapse — I faint, people gossip, clients leave — and I feel stupid and furious at myself for slipping into it. Please tell me to slow my breath and keep that steady rhythm; don't hurry.
