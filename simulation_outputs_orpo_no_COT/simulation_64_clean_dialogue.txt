Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little perceived failure drags me back to memories of being bullied at school, and it's eaten away at my confidence in class and around people. I'm in my fifties, a student again, and it feels ridiculous but I can't seem to shake it. I don't know, it's really hard to talk about.

Therapist: It takes a lot of courage to share this with me. What would it be like for just one moment, while you're in that loop of self-criticism, if you could notice that "harsh voice" as a thought, rather than believing it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I could notice it as just a thought it might feel a bit lighter, like there's a little space between me and it so it doesn't grab me. But I'm also scared that's just denial and if I stop believing it I'll actually mess up. Can we...talk about what I could say to that voice when it pops up in class?

Therapist: Noticing it as a thought, even for just a moment, might help create some space. Now, about what to say to that voice... What if, instead of trying to silence it, you could ask it: "What would happen if I could listen to this worry while still moving forward with my classwork?"

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I asked that, maybe the worry would ease a bit and let me keep going with my work instead of freezing. I can imagine saying something like, "I hear you, but I can still try," though it might feel fake when it first pops up. Can we...talk about a few small, simple phrases I could actually say in the moment? I'm getting a bit nervous just thinking about this.

Therapist: Small, simple phrases can be really helpful. When you say something like "I hear you, but I can still try," what's the small part that feels like it might be hard to say, exactly?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the hard part is saying anything that sounds like I'm okay with failing. "I can still try" feels like admitting I might mess up, and that makes me feel exposed and…stupid. It also feels fake, like I'm pretending to be brave when I'm actually panicking; can we come up with a couple of really short lines I could use that don't sound cheesy?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about being perceived as not brave. What if, instead of trying to convince yourself or others, you just noticed that "exposure" feels connected to what matters to you—like doing your work or showing up for your class.

Patient: I don't know — I guess that idea kind of fits. But if I notice it's about what matters, it actually makes me more scared, like I'm choosing to expose myself on purpose. Can we please come up with two really short, not-cheesy lines I could actually say in the moment?

Therapist: Let's focus on what you could say when that worry shows up. What if, when you notice it's about what matters, you say something like: "I'm here."

Patient: I don't know — "I'm here" feels kind of thin; I guess I need something a bit more grounding. Maybe two really short ones could be: "Okay, breathe" and "Just the next bit." They feel a little forced, but I'm nervous saying them out loud.

Therapist: Those phrases might help you feel a bit more connected to your body when the worry shows up. What if, when you say "Okay, breathe" or "Just the next bit," you could also notice where the worry is showing up in your body, just for a moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it shows up as a tightness in my chest and a knot in my stomach, my shoulders hike up and my jaw clenches. Saying "Okay, breathe" helps a little but I feel stupid doing it in front of people; can we talk about quiet ways to anchor myself that don't draw attention? I'm getting nervous even saying this, so I might try to change the subject, but I actually want something that will work.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about being noticed, even by yourself. What if, instead of trying to change the subject or hide it, you could notice what it would be like to stay with that tightness in your chest *while* you're sitting in class, and then *after* the class is over?

Patient: I don't know — I guess staying with it in class would feel awful, like everyone could see me fall apart. Maybe I could try a tiny, quiet check-in: one slow breath and press my thumb and forefinger together, or silently name the tightness "tight" for three counts. I'm getting really nervous about this — can we make those steps even smaller, like just try it once during class and then I write one sentence about how it felt afterward?

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. What if, during class, you could just notice the tightness *right now*, without trying to change it, and then write this sentence: "My chest feels tight when I think about not doing well."

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try that one tiny notice and then write the sentence: "My chest feels tight when I think about not doing well." It feels awkward and I'm already nervous about actually doing it in class. Can we also talk about what I should notice or do right after I write it?

Therapist: What if, right after you write that sentence, you just noticed where your thumb and fingers are *right now*, not about what they're supposed to be doing or how they should feel?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try that. It seems tiny enough to be private, though I'm already imagining excuses I'll use instead of doing it. Can we pick a quick, private reminder I could use so I don't just chicken out?

Therapist: What if, instead of "I'll just do it," you used this small reminder: "One breath, one sentence."

Patient: I don't know — I guess "One breath, one sentence" could work; it's small enough that nobody would notice. I'm worried I'll still chicken out though — maybe just "One breath" or a tiny finger tap under the desk would feel safer. I'm getting really nervous saying this, but I do want something that actually fits my panic moments.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for something that feels tiny and safe, so you can show up in class even when you're scared. What if, instead of trying to control it, you just noticed what felt possible to do right now, like that tiny finger tap?

Patient: I don't know — I guess that tiny finger tap might actually be doable. Okay, I'll try one breath and a single tap under the desk, then write the sentence afterward, but I'm already worrying I'll chicken out. Can we have a quick backup plan if I freeze, like maybe squeeze my other hand or text myself a one-word reminder?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "not freeze," you just noticed that you *are* freezing, and that it's okay to take a moment to catch yourself, then *what* would it be like to tap your finger and write the sentence anyway?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing that I'm freezing supposed to help me actually tap my finger and write the sentence? I don't know, I guess I'm scared that noticing it will just make me more stuck and I'll sit there feeling stupid. I can try to imagine the tap as a tiny permission to move, but I'm already getting nervous and might chicken out — can we make a backup plan that's even smaller?

Therapist: What if, when you notice that freezing feeling, you just *look* at your finger, and then *write* that sentence one word at a time, without thinking about it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess looking at my finger and writing the sentence one word at a time could work; it feels embarrassingly small but maybe that's why it would help. I'm already picturing myself freezing and then getting self-conscious, so can we make a tinier backup — like just touch my thumb to my finger once, and if that feels okay then try the one-word writing? I'm nervous about this and might try to change the subject, but I want something that actually fits when I panic.

Therapist: Let's make it even smaller. What if you just *touch* your thumb to your finger, for just a moment, and then try the one-word writing?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try touching my thumb to my finger once, just a quick, hidden tap under the desk. But I'm already picturing freezing and worrying someone will notice; can we have an even tinier backup, like just thinking a single word in my head (maybe "here") if I can't move? I'm getting anxious about this and might flit to something else, but I actually want it to work.

Therapist: Let's make it as small as a heartbeat. What if you just *think* the word "here" for a moment, and that's it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try thinking "here" for a beat, but I'm already worried it'll feel pointless and I'll still freeze. If that doesn't work maybe I could squeeze my other hand or do the tiny finger tap under the desk as a backup. How long do you mean — one heartbeat or a few seconds? I'm getting nervous about this, so I might try to change the subject, but I do want something that actually helps.

Therapist: What matters isn't the length of time, but the fact that it's happening. Instead of "as long as it takes," what if it was just *one* tiny beat, and that's enough to notice "here"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — one tiny beat? I don't know, I guess that could be doable, like thinking "here" for a single heartbeat. But I'm worried it'll feel pointless and I'll still freeze; can we have a tiny backup, like a secret squeeze of my other hand if that happens? I'm already getting anxious about trying it.

Therapist: What if, when you feel that "pointless" thought, you just *squeeze* your other hand, without thinking about it, and then *think* "here" for one heartbeat?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is squeezing my other hand supposed to help when I'm freezing? I don't know, I guess I can try one quick squeeze and think "here" for a single heartbeat, but I'm already worrying I'll just freeze and do nothing. Can we keep the tiny finger tap as a backup if that happens? I'm getting anxious just talking about this.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make it work, but it's still feeling really hard. What if, instead of trying to make the squeeze or the tap happen, you just *allowed* it to happen *while* you were thinking "here" for that single heartbeat?

Patient: I don't know — I guess letting it happen while I think "here" for one beat might take some of the pressure off, like I'm not forcing anything. But I'm scared it'll do nothing and I'll still freeze, so can we have the tiny finger tap as a backup and a really short plan for after class if it fails? Honestly, I'm getting jittery just talking about it — can we also quickly go over one thing I could say to myself afterward so I don't spiral into being ashamed?

Therapist: What matters is that you're willing to try. Let's keep the tiny finger tap as a backup. 

For after class, if it feels like you still froze, what if you just *noticed* where you were in that moment, and then *said* to yourself: "That's okay."

Patient: I don't know — I guess "That's okay" might help a little, like it could stop me from beating myself up afterward. But I'm already worried it'll sound fake and I'll just feel ashamed anyway. Can we pick one more short thing I could say that feels a little more real—maybe "I tried" or "I did what I could"? I'm getting jittery saying this, so sorry if I keep shifting, I just want something that actually fits.

Therapist: What matters is that you're willing to try. Let's keep the tiny finger tap as a backup. 

For after class, if it feels like you still froze, what if you just *said* to yourself: "I took a step."

Patient: I don't know — I guess "I took a step" might actually sit okay with me; it doesn't pretend everything went fine, just that I moved. But I'm worried it'll feel hollow and I'll still berate myself afterward. Can we pick between "I took a step" and "I tried" and…maybe say it out loud once so it feels less stupid?

Therapist: Let's try saying it out loud: "I took a step."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying it out loud supposed to help? 

"I took a step." I don't know — saying that felt oddly small but a little real, and also kind of fake at the same time. Can we try one more tiny line I could say afterward that won't make me feel like an idiot?

Therapist: Saying it out loud was just to make it feel a bit more concrete. 

Let's try: "That was hard."

Patient: I don't know — I guess "That was hard" feels kind of honest, like it names what happened without pretending. But I'm not sure I follow how saying it out loud stops me from spiraling, and saying it already makes me want to hide. Can we think of one more tiny, less exposed-sounding line—maybe "I showed up" or something even smaller?

Therapist: Let's try: "I sat."

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow, how is "I sat" supposed to help? I guess "I sat" feels honest but also kind of thin, like it won't stop me from beating myself up afterward. Maybe "I sat through it" would feel a bit more real, but I'm already nervous about sounding pathetic.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that "I sat through it" might still be too exposed. What if, instead of trying to sound brave, you just noticed what mattered to you while you were sitting there?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't know how I'm supposed to notice what mattered without feeling like everyone's watching me. I guess what mattered was actually getting the work done and not disappointing myself (and maybe not letting the loss feel like it took everything), but saying that makes me feel exposed and I want to skip it. I don't know… can we talk about a really quiet way to notice that doesn't make me feel like I'm on display?

Therapist: What if, while you're sitting there, you could just notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, without thinking about it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess noticing my feet might help in theory, but it feels weird and like it'll just make me more aware of how tense I am. Maybe I could try something even smaller, like feeling my thumb and finger together under the desk so no one notices. I'm nervous saying this, but I do want something that won't draw attention.
