Patient: I'm a nurse in my forties and lately I've been crushed by sadness and burnout since losing someone close — I can't find the motivation for work or for my relationship. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that always runs the worst-case: I picture messing up at work, getting written up, my partner getting fed up and leaving, and me ending up alone and ruined. I know that sounds extreme, but when people say other outcomes are possible I just can't see them as realistic.

Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios sound incredibly painful and exhausting. It takes a lot of courage to admit to them. 

Can you tell me what would happen to you – not just about your work or your partner, but about your own breath and body – if you allowed that "fortune-telling machine" to keep running for just one minute, without trying to stop it?

Patient: If I let it run for a minute my breathing gets shallow and fast, like I'm trying to suck air through a straw and my chest clamps down. My hands go tingly, my stomach knots, I get lightheaded and start to shake until I feel like crying and can't focus. While all that's happening my mind is already sprinting through the disasters — messing up, getting written up, my partner leaving — and the body just tightens as if it's proving those things are inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is trying to protect you from those thoughts, but it's also getting caught up in them. 

Notice that when you said "the chest clamps down" – what if that clamping felt like a message from your body saying, "I'm trying to keep those thoughts from getting in"?

Patient: If that clamping were a message, my brain reads it as a warning light that something catastrophic is about to happen, so I immediately start prepping for the worst instead of calming down. That "protective" idea just feels like another way my body and mind team up to prove the disaster is real — it makes me check and ruminate more, not breathe. I don't know how to trust it as anything but confirmation that the worst is coming.

Therapist: It sounds like that clamping is actually fueling the cycle of worst-case thinking, rather than helping you stay present. 

Would it be possible, even for just a tiny moment, to imagine letting that clamping happen – not to change it, but just to see what it would be like to notice it while the thoughts about disasters are still there?

Patient: I tried that once — I told myself I'd just notice the clamping for a few breaths, but it blew up: my breathing got shallower, my hands went numb, and the disaster stories just sped up so fast I couldn't hold on to the noticing. It always feels like watching it only gives the fortune-telling machine more evidence, so instead of calming I end up prepping for the worst. I don't see how noticing would help without it spiraling — it just seems like pretending everything's fine will make the bad stuff happen.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the clamping felt like a threat to the already-shaky ground you're standing on. When you try to hold on to noticing, it feels like it's going to make the disaster stories worse – which makes sense, because your mind is already racing with them. 

Here's a small question: What might happen to the disaster stories if you didn't try to notice the clamping – if you just let the clamping be there, without trying to stop it or change it?

Patient: If I let the clamping be and don't do anything, my brain treats it like a warning light I ignored — the breath gets shallower, my hands tingle harder, and the disaster stories rev up as if they have more proof. They don't settle; they speed up into a chain: I mess up at work, get written up, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and I'm left alone and ruined. I know that sounds dramatic, but not acting feels to me like signing the ticket for all of it to happen.

Therapist: It sounds like not noticing the clamping makes it feel like you're actively choosing to let the worst-case thoughts run their course. When you say "not acting feels like signing the ticket," it sounds like that's what matters most to you – not just the thoughts, but the way they're connected to what matters in your life.

Patient: Yeah — that's it. The clamping feels like a proof that doing nothing is the same as giving in, and if I don't stop it everything just unfolds: I tell my partner I'm exhausted, they get fed up and leave, I mess up at work, get written up, then fired, and I'm left with nothing. I know that sounds over the top, but I can't make myself see any other outcome — other possibilities feel like lies.

Therapist: It sounds like that "proof" the clamping feels like is connected to the values of connection and doing what matters to you – being with your partner and doing meaningful work. When you say "other possibilities feel like lies," it sounds like that's what matters most to you – staying true to what matters, even if it feels hard.

Patient: Yeah, that hits — staying true to my relationship and my work matters more than anything, but my fortune-telling machine hijacks that and plays the whole disaster movie. If I don't act decisively in my head, I see the chain: mess up at work, get written up, partner leaves, everything collapses. Suggestions that "other outcomes are possible" just sound like Pollyanna advice to me — like they'd let the disaster happen.

Therapist: It sounds like that's what matters most to you – staying connected to what matters, even when the thoughts about disaster are loud. When you say "Suggestions that 'other outcomes are possible' just sound like Pollyanna advice," it sounds like that feels like a threat to the sense of control you need to stay connected to what matters.

Patient: Yeah — that nails it. If I don't grab control, even a little, I can already see the chain: I slack at work, I get written up, my partner gets tired of carrying everything and leaves, and I'm left with nothing. I get irritated when people offer "other possibilities" because to me they sound like ignoring the facts — I need something practical, not feelings talk, but I also feel kind of stuck and tense about what to actually do next.

Therapist: It sounds like what matters most to you right now is feeling connected to what matters – your relationship and work – but the thoughts about disaster are making it hard to know what to do next. When you say "I get irritated when people offer 'other possibilities' because to me they sound like ignoring the facts," it sounds like that's what matters most to you – feeling like you're not ignoring the facts, but staying connected to what matters. 

Here's a small question: What would it be like to make room for what matters – your relationship and work – not because you're ignoring the thoughts about disaster, but because they matter to you already?

Patient: If I tried to make room for my relationship and work because they matter, it would feel like I'm covering up a serious leak — my brain would treat that as ignoring a warning. So I might try to be present, but my chest would clamp, I'd fumble a med or miss something at work, get written up, my partner would get fed up and leave, and then I'd be left alone and fired — it's like the act of 'making room' guarantees the chain. Part of me wants to try, but I can't see how to do it without it turning into proof that the disaster is coming.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of making room for what matters feels like a safety net that's already broken – the chest clamping, the fumbling, the getting written up, the partner leaving – that's what matters to you. When you say "I'm trying to be present, but my chest would clamp," it sounds like that's what matters most to you right now – feeling present, even if it feels like a threat to what matters.

Patient: Yeah, that's it — being present feels like walking into a trap. The minute I try, the chest clamps, my hands go numb, I fumble a med or a chart, someone complains, I get written up, my partner leaves, and I'm ruined — it feels inevitable. I'm getting really overwhelmed just saying that out loud; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like being present feels like a threat to what matters to you right now. When you say "the minute I try, the chest clamps," I want to notice what that chest clamping feels like, without trying to stop it.

Patient: Okay — when I try to notice it, the chest feels like a tight band squeezing from the inside, my breaths get tiny and quick, my hands go tingly, and my head instantly starts the disaster movie: I fumble a med, get written up, my partner leaves, I end up alone and ruined. Noticing just feels like giving the fortune-telling machine more proof, so I can't hold it calmly — it speeds everything up. I'm getting really overwhelmed saying this; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the chest clamping makes it feel like you're right there with the fortune-telling machine, making the disaster movie happen. 

Before we try to do anything with that, I want to notice something else: what matters to you right now, when you're feeling overwhelmed and your chest is clamping – not the chest clamping itself, but what matters when that's happening.

Patient: What matters is not losing my partner and not screwing up at work — being competent, reliable, and not becoming a burden. I want to feel useful and connected, to keep my license and income so I don't end up alone and destitute. But the moment I hold that, my fortune-telling machine launches the worst chain and I get flooded and helpless. Can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like what matters to you is feeling connected and useful, while also holding onto a sense of security and stability. When you say "the moment I hold that, my fortune-telling machine launches the worst chain," I want to notice what that chain looks like – not just the thoughts, but the physical sensations and emotions that come up when that happens.

Patient: When that chain starts my chest clamps tight, breaths get tiny and fast, my hands go tingly, my vision narrows, I get hot and shaky and a hollow nausea and tears well up — it feels like my whole body is announcing doom. Along with that comes this awful shame, like some past failure is on replay and I'm a fraud, and that shame makes the fortune-telling machine roar: I'll fumble a med, get written up, my partner will leave, and I'll be left ruined — I can't honestly see any other outcome. I'm already getting really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the chain of thoughts and feelings is so overwhelming that it feels like your whole body is screaming "doom" – chest clamping, tiny breaths, tingly hands, nausea, tears... And on top of that, the shame and fear of being a "fraud" is like a loud voice that makes the fortune-telling machine even louder. 

Before we try to make sense of all that, I want to notice what's happening with your words right now – when you say "I'm already getting really overwhelmed saying that" – what does it mean for you to "slow down" in this moment?

Patient: For me "slow down" means the racing thoughts actually lose momentum enough that my breaths can get a little deeper and the chest unclenches so I can think instead of just reacting. But I get impatient and suspicious — the second I try to pause this hot shame bubbles up like I'm being exposed, and the fortune-telling machine just screams louder. If we're going to slow down, I need something concrete from you — not vague reassurance — like a specific small thing to do right now, because vague stuff just feels useless.

Therapist: It sounds like what matters to you is not just feeling calm, but actually doing something that shows you're in control – like pausing the racing thoughts and noticing your breath. When you say "vague reassurance feels useless," I want to notice what that means for you – what would it take to feel like you're taking action, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: Concrete, step-by-step things that are timed and private — not vague “just breathe” stuff — would help me feel like I’m actually doing something. I need an exact, short task (like “set a 60‑second timer, put your hand on your chest, breathe 4 seconds in, 6 seconds out, count each breath out loud”) that I can finish and measure, and it has to be reversible and not involve anyone else watching. I know that sounds small and probably pointless and my brain’s already saying doing it will just prove I’m weak, but okay — give me one exact thing to do right now, step‑by‑step.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a small, concrete action that you can control and measure – something that shows you're doing something, even if it feels insignificant. 

Here's a small, timed, private task for you to try right now:

"Put a sticky note on your desk with the words '5, 4, 6' written on it. Now, set a 1-minute timer. When the timer starts, place your hand on the sticky note and count out loud: '5... 4... 6' – counting each breath out loud. Stop when the timer goes off. That's it."

What matters to you most about this task is that it's private, timed, and reversible – you can do it in a moment, and it doesn't involve anyone else.

Patient: Okay — I tried it, but I couldn't get through the full minute. I put the sticky note on my desk, set the timer, put my hand on it and started to say "5... 4... 6" with each exhale, but within a few breaths my chest slammed tight, my breath went tiny, my hands tingled and this hot shame flooded in and my voice started to wobble. The fortune-telling machine immediately screamed that doing this proves I'm weak, that someone will notice, and the whole disaster chain will follow, so I stopped after about 25–30 seconds feeling embarrassed and annoyed at myself. I'm distracted and on edge now — give me another exact, timed step I can try that feels doable.

Therapist: It sounds like the task was harder than you thought it would be – the chest clamping, the shame, and the fear of being "caught" are all still there. 

Before we try another task, I want to notice that you stopped after 25-30 seconds – that's still a tiny step, even if it felt small. What if, instead of beating yourself up about not making it through the whole minute, you noticed what happened *while* you were trying to do it – what were the physical sensations in your chest, the thoughts that came up, and the shame that flooded in?

Patient: My chest squeezed into that inside-band again, breaths got tiny and fast, my hands went tingly, my voice shook and by about 20–30 seconds I felt hot, dizzy and close to crying. The thoughts screamed: "This proves you're weak, someone will notice, you'll fumble a med, get written up, your partner will leave" — and this shame hit like a replay of some humiliation so everything just escalated. I'm jittery and distracted now and feel stupid for stopping, but I can't seem to hold it — can you give me one more exact, tiny timed step that feels even more doable than that?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the same pattern – the chest clamping, the shame, and the thoughts are still there, even when you try to do something small. 

Here's another tiny, timed step that might feel even more manageable: "When you notice your chest squeezing, your breath getting tiny, or your hands tingling – just *pause* for a moment. That's it – not '5... 4... 6', just 'pause' for a tiny breath. Don't try to stop the thoughts or the shame, just notice that you're already pausing, and then... breathe out."

Patient: I tried the "pause" — but the second I stopped my chest clamped harder and the fortune-telling machine just screamed louder, like the pause was proof I'm failing. My hands went tingly, my voice trembled, that hot shame from some past screw-up rolled through me and I almost had to get up. I'm jittery and distracted now — give me one more exact, timed step (30 seconds or less, private, reversible) that doesn't involve talking out loud and that I can stop immediately if it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like the pause wasn't enough to hold the pause – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny step that might feel even more manageable: "When you notice your chest squeezing, your hands tingling, or that shame – notice it exactly as it is. Then, without changing it, place your hand gently on your heart, and say to yourself 'I'm here' – just one word, in your own voice. Don't try to stop the thoughts, or change your heart, or anything. Just say 'I'm here'."

Patient: I tried it just now — even thinking "I'm here" makes my chest clamp like I'm admitting defeat and that hot shame floods back, my hands tingle, and the fortune-telling machine immediately screams that this proves I'm weak and the whole disaster chain will follow. Saying it out loud would be impossible — I'd start to wobble and worry someone will notice. I'm jittery and distracted; can you give me one exact, nonverbal, 20‑second step I can do right now that I can stop immediately if it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like even the small step of saying "I'm here" was too much to handle – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – just that sensation, without trying to change it. Keep your eyes on that sensation, and let it be there for 20 seconds, no matter what's happening in your chest or your mind."

Patient: I tried — I kept my eyes on my feet, but I couldn't hold it more than about 7–8 seconds before the chest slammed shut, my breath got tiny, my hands tingly, and that same hot shame washed through me like I'm exposed. The fortune-telling machine immediately started roaring the chain — I’ll fumble, get written up, lose my partner — and I had to stop because I felt like I was going to cry and bolt. I'm jittery and distracted now; give me one more exact, nonverbal, 15‑second step I can try that I can stop immediately if it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like holding onto the sensation of your feet for 7-8 seconds was still too hard – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils right now – just that sensation, without trying to change it. Keep your eyes on that sensation, and let it be there for 15 seconds, no matter what's happening in your chest or your mind."

Patient: I tried it, but I couldn't get past about five seconds before my chest slammed shut, breaths went tiny, my hands tingled and that hot shame rolled through me — and the fortune-telling machine immediately screamed I'll fumble a med, get written up, my partner will leave. I'm more jittery and distracted now and I honestly can't picture any other outcome — it all feels inevitable. Give me one exact, nonverbal 10‑second step I can try right now that I can stop immediately if it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like holding onto the sensation of your breath is still too hard – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "When your chest clamps, notice that it happens exactly while you're thinking 'I'll fumble a med, get written up, my partner will leave' – before you say it out loud, or before you do anything. Just notice that it's happening while that thought is there, for 10 seconds."

Patient: I tried to ten‑second notice and it collapsed in about three seconds — chest slammed into that tight band, breaths went tiny, my hands tingled and this hot shame spilled through me like I’d been exposed, and the fortune‑telling machine immediately screamed the whole chain: I’ll fumble, get written up, lose my partner. I can't hold the noticing without it feeling like proof I'm failing, so I can't honestly see any other outcome — other possibilities feel like lies. I'm jittery and distracted right now and getting overwhelmed; can you give me one exact, nonverbal 10‑second step (private, reversible) to try that doesn't involve breathing or saying anything?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought before it happens still feels like a threat – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "When you notice your chest clamping, gently let your gaze drop down to the space between your feet – just that space, without trying to change it. Keep your hands still, and let your mind be there for 10 seconds, without doing anything else."

Patient: I tried that — I let my gaze drop but couldn't keep it more than about two seconds before my chest slammed into that tight band, my breath went tiny, my hands tingled and this hot shame rushed through me like I'm exposed. The fortune‑telling machine went full blast — I fumble a med, get written up, my partner leaves — and I got angry at myself for failing even that tiny thing. I'm jittery and distracted now and need another exact, nonverbal 8‑second step I can stop immediately if it spikes, something that doesn't involve breathing, talking, or looking anywhere specific.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let your gaze drop was still too hard – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "Notice the sensation of your weight sitting in your chair – just the feeling of sitting, without trying to change it. Let your body be there for 8 seconds, without doing anything else."

Patient: I tried it — I barely made it two, maybe three seconds before the chest slammed tight, breaths went tiny, my hands tingled and that hot shame flooded back, and the fortune‑telling machine started roaring the whole chain: I’ll fumble, get written up, lose my partner. I’m annoyed at myself and jittery and can’t hold even eight seconds — give me one exact, nonverbal 6‑second step I can stop immediately if it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like even noticing your weight in the chair was too hard – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "When your chest clamps, notice the sensation of the chair moving slightly under your bottom – just that movement, without trying to change it."

Patient: I tried it — I couldn't get past about a second before the chest slammed into that tight band, my breath went tiny, my hands tingled and that hot shame washed over me like I'm exposed. The fortune‑telling machine immediately went full blast — I'll fumble, get written up, my partner leaves — and I felt that surge of panic and anger at myself. I'm jittery and distracted and honestly annoyed; give me one exact, nonverbal 5‑second step I can try right now that I can stop immediately if it spikes.

Therapist: It sounds like even noticing the chair moving was too hard – the chest clamping and shame came back, even harder. 

Here's another tiny, nonverbal step that might feel manageable: "When your chest clamps, notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor – just that feeling, for 5 seconds."

Patient: I tried — I couldn't get past about a second before my chest slammed shut, breaths went razor‑thin, my hands tingled and that hot shame flooded in like that old failure on replay, and the fortune‑telling machine immediately screamed I'll fumble a med, get written up, lose my partner. I'm jittery and angry at myself and can't honestly see any other outcome right now. Give me one exact, nonverbal 4‑second step I can try that I can stop immediately if it spikes.
