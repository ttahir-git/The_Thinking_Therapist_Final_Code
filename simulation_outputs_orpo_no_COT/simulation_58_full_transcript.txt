--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I keep getting swallowed by this anger and frustration, especially when anything about work or money comes up — small things set me off and I end up snapping at people. I'm an artist, I lost steady gigs and that loss has turned into this stubborn grief I can't seem to get a handle on. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried things before and they didn't; how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when those moments of anger and frustration show up, you feel like they're taking over, and that small things at work or with money are triggering that feeling. And now, the loss of those gigs has become really hard to bear, and it feels like you're stuck with this grief.

Can you tell me what it would be like, just for a moment, if you let that anger and frustration be there, without trying to push it away or fix it? Not to make it go away, but just to notice it, as it is, while you're still able to talk to me.

Patient: If I try to let it be, there's this tightness in my chest, my hands clench, and my thoughts go straight to failure and shame — like a loop of everything that's gone wrong. Maybe if I just notice it, it doesn't explode as fast, but honestly, how is that supposed to help? Sitting with it feels scary and exposed, like I'm letting it have more of me instead of fighting it off.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: The loop of failure and shame sounds really tight. When you notice that loop, what happens if you could make room for it right there, while you're still noticing it as tightness in your chest and clenching hands? Not to change it, but to see if there's space for it to be there while you're still talking to me.

Patient: If I try to make room for it, it usually gets louder at first — my heart speeds up, memories of lost gigs pop up, and I start running through every mistake I've made. Sometimes paying attention like that feels like it could stop me from exploding, but most of the time it just turns into more looped thinking, like I'm rehearsing the anger. Seriously, how is that supposed to help when I've already tried sitting with it and it just spiraled?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to make room for it, the loop gets louder, and that feels like a failure. When that happens, what matters most to you about what you want to do with that anger and frustration?

Patient: What matters most is that this anger doesn't keep wrecking the few relationships and chances I have left — I don't want to drive people away or sabotage a chance at another gig. I want to be able to talk about money or work without turning into that tight, ashamed person who lashes out, but honestly, how is noticing it supposed to actually change that pattern? I need something that actually helps me do things differently, not just sit with the feeling and watch it loop.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like what matters most is that you can be present with others and create space for connection while still holding that anger and frustration. When you think about what would happen if you could be with that anger and frustration without it taking over, what would you be able to do with your hands and voice that feels different from lashing out?

Patient: I guess my hands wouldn't be clinched into fists but maybe busy with something — holding a pencil, rubbing the edge of a canvas, or just resting open on my lap instead of trembling. My voice might be quieter and more measured, able to say, "I need a minute" or "I'm upset right now" instead of snapping, but I've told myself that before and it doesn't stick. How is that supposed to help when the loop just grabs me and I can't catch a breath?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having your hands open and your voice quieter might feel like a small step, but it's hard to hold onto that feeling when the loop shows up. What if, instead of trying to catch your breath or push the loop away, you could just notice where it is – not to change it, but to see if there's room for it to be there while you're still trying to do something with your hands and voice?

Patient: I can feel it like a pressure in my chest and a clench in my jaw, and my hands go all twitchy — that's where I'd notice it. Maybe I could hold a pencil or say, "I need a minute," but I've tried that and it usually falls apart when someone's impatient. How is simply noticing any of that supposed to help when the loop just takes over?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice while still holding onto the "solution" (like holding a pencil or saying "I need a minute") feels like it's not working for you. What if, instead of trying to notice while still holding onto that solution, you could try noticing just what's happening when you feel like you're about to fall apart – the pressure in your chest, the clench in your jaw, the twitchy hands? Not to fix it, but just to see what that feels like, right there.

Patient: Alright — if I try that now I notice a hot pressure under my ribs, my jaw locked, fingers rubbing the edge of my canvas until they hurt, and my breath gets shallow. Focusing on those things makes the thoughts louder — I start replaying the gigs I messed up and the shame swells, like I'm giving it material to keep going. But seriously, how is paying attention to all that supposed to help when it usually just fuels the spiral?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that pressure, that jaw clench, and those hands hurting feels like you're giving the shame more fuel. What if, instead of trying to notice all that and stop it, you could try noticing it while you're still doing something with your hands – like holding that pencil, even if it hurts, or painting even if it's messy.

Patient: I can try that — when I hold a pencil the tension eases a bit and the strokes get angry but contained, and sometimes the paint catches the feeling so it doesn't blow up outwards. Mostly it doesn't stick though; I start berating the messy work and the shame comes roaring back. How is that supposed to help when someone presses me about money in the moment — can you talk me through it right now so it doesn't just fall apart?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding that pencil is helping a bit, but the shame is still coming up. When someone presses you about money, what matters most to you right then – staying angry and wanting to lash out, or being able to breathe and respond to them in a way that doesn't hurt them?

Patient: What matters most is not burning the few bridges I have left — not pushing people away or ruining a chance at work because I lost my temper. I want to be able to say, “I need a minute” or put my hands on the table instead of clenching and shouting, but I doubt that will stick. Can you actually walk me through what to do in the moment when someone’s pressing me about money so it doesn’t just fall apart?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: Let's try to break it down together. When someone's pressing you about money, what's the first thing that shows up in your body – the tension in your chest, the clench in your jaw, the twitchy hands? Not to stop it, but just to notice it right there. 

As you notice that tension, what's one small thing you could do with your hands – like putting them on the table, or holding a pen – that doesn't try to stop the anger, but just makes room for it?

Patient: I could put my palms flat on the table and press them down, or grip a pencil and let it scribble the edge of a page, or rub the corner of a canvas — it makes my hands do something so they don't ball into fists. That eases the twitch a little, but I've used that trick before and it usually falls apart when someone keeps pushing me — how is that supposed to help in the middle of a confrontation? Can you walk me through exactly what to say while I'm doing that so it doesn't just blow up?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on what matters most to you right now – staying calm enough to talk about money without losing control. 

When you put your palms flat on the table, what's the first thing you might notice about your breath? It gets shallow. When that happens, what's one tiny thing you could do with that breath – like taking one slow breath in, and then another slow one out – that doesn't try to stop the anger, but just makes room for it?

As you do that, what's one simple thing you could say to the person – not to convince them, but just to show them you're there – that doesn't try to fix the problem, but just says, "I'm here with you"?

Patient: I'd put my palms flat, take a slow breath in and a longer one out to try to slow the spike, and then say something simple like, "I'm feeling upset right now — I need a minute." But honestly, most people get impatient and that line doesn't hold; how is that supposed to help when they just press harder? Can you walk me through how to say it so it actually sticks?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Let's try to break it down even further. When you say, "I'm feeling upset right now — I need a minute," what's the next thing that shows up in your body – the tension in your chest, the clench in your jaw, the twitchy hands?

As you notice that tension, what's one tiny thing you could do with that tension – like letting your jaw relax just a little bit, or releasing the tightness in your chest – that doesn't try to stop the upset, but just makes room for it?

When you say those words, "I'm feeling upset right now — I need a minute," what's the meaning behind those words to you? Not what the other person is going to think, but what matters most to you right now – what's holding you back from talking about money?

Patient: Saying that line feels like a last-ditch move to not blow up — it's me trying to be honest and buy a little space so I don't say something I'll regret. It also feels like admitting I'm vulnerable, which triggers shame because losing steady work already makes me feel like a failure. What holds me back is that shame and the worry people will use the pause against me or just press harder, and the memory that I’ve tried this before and it didn’t stick. Honestly, how is that supposed to help when they ignore me? Can you actually help me practice what to say if they don't give me that minute?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying "I need a minute" feels like a way to save face, but it also makes you feel vulnerable and ashamed. When you notice that shame creeping up, what would it take for you to be willing to say that line anyway – not because you're trying to control the other person, but because it matters to you to talk about money without losing control?

Let's try something small. When you feel that shame and worry about what the other person will do, what's one tiny thing you could do with that feeling – like taking a deep breath, or noticing the sensation in your body – that doesn't try to stop the shame, but just makes room for it?

Now, what if, instead of saying "I need a minute," you said, "I'm really struggling with this right now. I feel like I'm losing my way with money, and it's making me feel like a failure." What would that feel like to say that truth, even if you're scared it might not work?

Patient: Saying that out loud would feel like ripping a bandage off — painful and exposing, but maybe a little honest. I’d be terrified they’d use it against me and the shame would roll in, even if it calms me for a moment. I could try it, but I’ve said things like that before and it didn’t change how people reacted — how is this supposed to actually make them stop pressing me?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that saying that truth might just make things worse, and that's a really tough spot to be in. When you think about it, what's one tiny thing that would happen if you said that truth anyway – not because you're trying to change the other person, but because it matters to you to be honest about how you're feeling?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is a little relief — like I stop pretending everything's fine for a second and get to breathe, which could slow the spike long enough to say, "Can we pause?" But admitting that feels raw and shameful, like I'm handing them proof I'm failing, and that shame flares up and makes me hate myself in the moment, so I'm skeptical it'll actually help. If it did work, it might keep me from snapping and let me handle the money talk without wrecking things, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when most times it just becomes ammo against me?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where you're worried that saying the truth will make things worse, but you're also desperate to break free from the shame and anger that's driving you to snap. 

Let's try to imagine what would happen if you could hold onto that tiny spark of relief just for a second – not to change the other person, but just to see what happens when you say, "Can we pause?" What if that small act of bravery wasn't about winning a battle or losing a war, but just about being present with yourself for a moment?

Patient: Maybe holding that little spark would give me a second to breathe and say, "Can we pause?" so I don't blow up. But it feels raw and shameful and I'm sure they'll just use it as proof I'm failing — honestly, how is that supposed to help when that always becomes ammo? If you're going to have me try it, walk me through exactly what to say and do when they don't give me the minute, because that's where it always falls apart.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: Let's try this. When you feel that spark of relief, and you want to say "Can we pause?", what if you added just one word to that sentence? What if you said, "Can we pause *right now*?" 

Notice what that adds to the sentence. It makes it more specific. It makes it more about what you're feeling in this moment, rather than about what might happen if they don't give you a minute.

Patient: "Right now" does make it feel more urgent and real — like I'm trying to stop the thing before it escalates. But just thinking about saying it makes shame flare up: my face goes hot, my chest tightens, my hands start to shake, and I want to either bolt or snap. How is that supposed to help when people just press harder? If we're going to try this, talk me through exactly what to say and do, step by step, if they ignore me — what comes next in the moment so it doesn't fall apart.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. When you feel that shame flare up, what's one tiny thing you could notice about your body that's different from the rest of the story you're telling yourself?

Patient: There’s this tiny slack in my jaw when I exhale — like it loosens a hair and the shouting in my head drops down a notch. I don’t know if noticing that will do anything… how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Noticing that tiny slack in your jaw when you exhale is a small act of kindness towards yourself. When you're willing to pay attention to that tiny thing, what's one tiny step you could take with your voice when they ignore you?

Patient: Maybe I could try lowering my voice — quieter, steady — and say, "Please, I need a minute," or "I can't talk about this right now." That little slack in my jaw might help keep it even instead of snapping. But I'm tired of trying things that don't work — how is that supposed to help when they just keep talking over me?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated. When you're willing to notice that tiny slack in your jaw, what matters most to you right then isn't about changing the other person or making them stop talking – it's about holding onto a tiny bit of control in the moment.

Patient: What matters most is grabbing that tiny bit of control — keeping my jaw a little slack, lowering my voice, and getting out, "Please, I need a minute." I'm worn down and the shame claws back so fast I feel small and defensive again. How is that supposed to help when they just talk over me? If you're going to have me try, walk me through exactly what to do step‑by‑step when they ignore that — I need something that actually holds in the moment.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: Let's try this. When you notice the shame clawing back and feeling small and defensive, what's one tiny thing you could do with your voice that doesn't try to fix the situation – just holds the space for a moment? 

Imagine you're standing there, with your jaw still a little slack, and you say, "I need a minute." Then, what if, instead of waiting for them to stop talking, you could take that one step back – just one step – and put your hands on the edge of the table or the chair?

Patient: I can picture it — say "I need a minute," step back, put my hands on the chair — but as soon as I imagine it my chest tightens and shame floods in, my voice gets thin and I feel small. How is that supposed to help when people just talk over me? Walk me through, word for word and move by move, what to do if they ignore it, because I don't trust I'll keep it together.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Let's break it down even further. When you notice your chest tightening and shame flooding in, what's one tiny thing you could notice about that sensation – not to change it, but just to see what it feels like?

Patient: There's this hot, tight knot right under my sternum that pulses with each breath, like a little drum that won't stop. Maybe I could notice that the pulse eases a hair when I exhale, but most times it just drags me into the same loop of shame and I don't have the energy to fight it. How is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: That knot feels like a tight weight. When you're willing to notice it, what's one tiny movement your body could make with that knot – not to push it away, but just to notice what happens if you let your hands rest on the chair while you say "I need a minute"?

Patient: I guess I could let my hands rest on the chair, push down a little, let my shoulders drop and exhale so the knot eases a hair. That slack in my jaw stays and I could murmur, "I need a minute," and let my weight shift back so I'm not leaning into the fight. But the shame wells up fast and I can't help asking — how is that supposed to help when they just keep talking over me and use my pause like proof I'm failing?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: That's a really tough question. When you notice the shame welling up, what matters most to you right then isn't about changing the other person or proving yourself – it's about holding onto that tiny bit of control to breathe. 

Imagine that moment, when you let your hands rest on the chair, your shoulders drop, and you say, "I need a minute." What would it be like if, instead of waiting for the shame to tell you what to do, you just noticed it – like a wave – and let the murmured "I need a minute" be a small act of kindness towards yourself, regardless of what they do next?

Patient: Maybe that murmured "I need a minute" would be a tiny kindness — a little island of air so I don't snap. But when I picture it, shame still floods in and it feels flimsy; how is that supposed to help when people just talk over me or use my pause as proof I'm failing? I don't have the energy for more vague ideas — walk me through, word for word and move by move, what to do if they ignore me, because that's the moment everything falls apart.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: Let's try this. When you feel that shame flooding in, and you're thinking, "This feels flimsy," what's one tiny thing you could do with your voice that doesn't try to change the situation – just holds the space for a moment? 

Notice how your hands are on the chair, and your shoulders are dropping. What if you just said, "I need a minute" – not to convince them, but just to say it – and then you would take that one step back, and put your weight on the other foot, not on the one that's leaning into the fight?

Patient: I try it: hands on the chair, shoulders drop, jaw loosens a bit when I exhale, and I murmur, "I need a minute," then take a step back and shift my weight. It eases things a hair, but shame still surges and my voice thins, and I can already see them talking over me or turning my pause into proof I'm useless. How is that supposed to help when they just ignore it? Walk me through, word for word and move by move, what to do next if they keep talking so it doesn't just fall apart.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: When you feel that shame surging, and your voice thinning, what matters most right now isn't about changing what they're doing – it's about holding onto that tiny bit of control to breathe. 

Notice how your hands are still on the chair, and your shoulders are still dropping. What if you just kept those hands on the chair, and you looked up at them, not to try to stop them, but just to see them – with your eyes, not with shame?

Patient: I look up and it feels like a dare — my chest tightens, my face heats, and the shame floods so my words thin out. I can murmur "I need a minute" and step back, but they usually just talk over me and everything collapses. Walk me through, word for word and move by move, what to say and do if they ignore me or mock me—how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame is so strong that it's making it hard to breathe. When you look up, and your chest tightens, what if you just noticed that feeling – not to try to stop it, but just to see what it feels like – while you still murmured, "I need a minute"?

Patient: I look up, my chest clamps down, breath shallow, and I barely murmur, "I need a minute." It feels humiliating — like I'm admitting I'm failing — and the shame hits hard so I brace for them to talk over me or scoff. How is that supposed to help if they ignore me? Tell me, step‑by‑step, what to say and do next so it doesn't just fall apart.
