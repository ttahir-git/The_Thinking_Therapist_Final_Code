--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck lately, constantly worrying about my performance as an artist—especially with the job instability—and it's making me procrastinate more than I used to. I guess I keep waiting for the next critique or for everything to fall apart, and that stops me from starting. I don't know, it feels weird to talk about, but it's been on my mind.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the uncertainty about your performance is really tangled up with your fear of failure – and that's making it hard for you to make progress on your art.

Patient: I guess that's probably right. I don't know, it's just—when I try to start a piece I can already hear the critiques in my head, so I freeze and do other things instead. I don't really like going deep into this, but maybe we could talk about small, practical ways to make starting less scary?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: What would happen if, right now, instead of trying to silence those critiques, you simply noticed them as they came up while you were trying to start that piece – not to change them, just to see them there?

Patient: I don't know... I guess maybe they'd lose some of their punch if I just noticed them, but it also feels like if I look at them they'll get bigger. Can we try something less scary—like I set a five-minute timer and just make one tiny mark while paying attention to the thoughts if they pop up?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: That's a small step towards making space for that art. What would happen to the timer if you made just *that* tiny mark – not even thinking about it being perfect, just that one mark?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the timer would ding and I'd probably still be sitting there, maybe a little surprised I started. Or I might stop right away because I'm already convinced it won't be any good. It feels embarrassing to admit, but maybe just doing it would be less awful than I think.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Noticing the possibility that the timer could still ding and you'd keep sitting there – that's already making room for the possibility that it might not be so bad after all.

Patient: I guess that makes a bit of sense. I don't know, it's weird to imagine the ding and me still being there and not freaking out—can we try the five-minute timer now? I'm kind of embarrassed about it, so maybe we could make it anonymous or just for me, not shared with anyone.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Let's make a quiet space for it. I'll be here with you, and you can do this in your own space – whenever you're ready. What happens if you set that timer for 5 minutes, and you make just *that* tiny mark, without thinking about it being good or bad?

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I guess I'll set the timer and make one tiny mark — I don't know if I'll keep going or bail as soon as it sounds, but maybe just doing it will be something. I'm nervous it'll be awful, so if I freeze can we... stay with it a bit?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: Let's stay with it for just a minute – when the timer goes off. What would it be like to sit there with the mark on the page, without needing to keep going, just for that one minute?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'd feel kind of exposed and a little relieved at the same time—like, embarrassed but also like I did something. Can we do it now? I might freeze, but please stay with me for that minute.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: I'll be here with you. Set the timer for 1 minute, and when you're ready, we'll make that tiny mark together.

Patient: Okay, I set the timer and made one tiny mark — just a little scratch, nothing fancy. I don't know, it feels kind of stupid but also a little lighter, like maybe I did something. My chest is tight and I'm embarrassed, and I might want to bail, so can we just sit with it for this minute? I'm not sure what to do next and I don't really like getting into it, but I guess I want you to stay with me.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: I'm here with you. That mark is small, and it's on the page – not on your chest. What would it be like to stay with the feeling of tightness in your chest, without trying to fix it or change it, just for this one minute?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a tight band around my ribs, like I can't get a full breath. If I pay attention to it it wants me to look away or busy myself, but... okay, I can try to stay with it for a minute — I'm nervous, and I might start rambling or changing the subject, so please don't let me bail.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: Let's stay with the band around your ribs. What happens when you notice that "I want to look away" thought – what does that look like when you notice it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a little tug at the back of my neck — my shoulders hunch, my breath gets shallow, and my eyes drift to the window or to a paintbrush on the table. I start fiddling with something or make a joke to steer us away. I'm nervous about staying with it, but... okay, I'll try if you keep me here.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: The tug in your neck, the hunch in your shoulders – that's what you're noticing when the "I want to look away" thought shows up. And what happens when you notice that you're already making room for it, just by noticing it – like your breath gets a little shallow, but the thought is still there?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I notice I'm making room, my breath stays shallow but there's this tiny slackening — like a little space opens up even if the thought's still there. Then the voice in my head immediately says it's pointless and I should do something else, and I feel the urge to fidget or change the subject. Can we keep sitting with it a bit? I'm not great at this and I might try to dodge again.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: The voice shows up – "it's pointless" – and you notice the urge to fidget or change the subject. What would it be like to stay with that feeling of slackening in your body, even if the thought comes up again?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to stay with that slackening my breath eases a little and the tightness loosens, but the critic's still there, whispering I'm wasting time. It feels really awkward and my instinct is to change the subject or busy myself, but maybe I can keep with it for a bit if you stay with me. I might start deflecting or making a joke, so call me on it if I do.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: Notice when the joke or deflecting thought shows up – like, "Oh, look at that funny thing on the wall" – what happens to the slackening in your body when you notice it's trying to move you away from that tiny space you created?

Patient: I don't know... I guess the slackening gets tugged back in — my shoulders bunch, my breath shortens, and I immediately want to make a joke or look at something else. It feels like any small win gets snatched away and it takes a lot to stay, so I might go quiet or drift if you don't keep me here.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: The tension comes back in, and the urge to escape shows up. I'm not trying to stop you from drifting – it's okay if you do. What would it be like if, instead of trying to stay with it, you noticed what happens when you *do* drift away – like, where does the tension show up in your body when you're not noticing the slackening?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I drift the little slackening snaps shut and the tension nests back in my shoulders and jaw, and my chest tightens like before — my stomach gets knotted too. I start fidgeting or poking at something, or I just stare out the window and tell myself I'll get back to it later. Can we slow down a bit? I don't really want to rush through this.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: The knot in your stomach, the fidgeting – that's what happens when you drift away. And the thought that you'll get back to it later feels like a promise to yourself that you might not keep. Let's take a deep breath together – not to change anything, just to notice what happens when we slow down.

Patient: I don't know... I guess okay. Breathing with you—my inhale's shallow at first, then it eases a bit, shoulders drop and that tight band loosens for a moment. Then my head immediately says it's pointless and wants me to fidget or crack a joke; can we just stay with this a little? I'm kind of worn out and might go quiet.


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: The band loosens, and the thought comes up again. I'm not asking you to stay with it – just to notice what happens when you notice it. Your inhale is shallow, your shoulders are dropping... what would it be like if that little space between the thought and your breath stayed open for just a moment longer?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow... I guess if that space stayed a bit longer my breath would ease and the tightness might loosen, like there'd be a little less scramble in my chest. I don't know though—my mind would probably start calling it pointless and I'd want to move or make a joke. Can we slow down? I don't really like digging into this and I might go quiet.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: That space staying a bit longer – it's like a tiny breath of air that might help the tightness ease. And when your mind starts to call it pointless, that's when the scramble happens. But what if, instead of trying to push through it, you noticed that scramble too – like it's just a part of what's happening when the thought comes up?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I noticed the scramble as just part of it it might stop feeling like something I have to battle — more like a wave that passes. But talking about it like this is wearing me out and I keep wanting to drift—can we shift to a small practical step instead, like how to make that five-minute thing feel less embarrassing so I actually do it?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: The wave that passes – that's a good way to look at it. And I'm not trying to wear you out – just noticing what's happening when you talk about it. Okay, let's focus on that small step. What would it take for you to make that five-minute mark *without* feeling embarrassed, even if it still feels awkward?

Patient: I don't know... I guess keeping it private would help—close the door, turn off my phone, and tell myself it's anonymous so no one will see it. Maybe set the timer for five minutes, promise myself a tiny reward after, and treat it like practice not a finished piece. I'm kind of worn out, so can we take it one tiny step at a time and you stay with me when I try?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: That feels like a good start. Keeping it private, setting a timer, promising a tiny reward – that's a way to make it feel more manageable. And treating it like practice, not a finished piece – that's a way to make it feel less weighted. I'll stay with you when you try. What would it take for you to take just one tiny step – like setting that timer – right now, without getting worn out?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I did it right now it would help to shut the door, put my phone on do‑not‑disturb, set a five‑minute timer, tell myself it's just practice, and promise a tiny reward after — like a cup of tea. I'm kind of wiped and will probably want to bail or make a joke, so can you stay with me for those five minutes and call me out if I start deflecting? I'll set the timer now if you'll hang in there with me.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: That's a good plan. Shutting the door, turning off your phone, setting the timer... that's a way to make it feel more manageable. And promising that tiny reward after – like a cup of tea – that's a way to make it feel more worth it. I'll stay with you for those five minutes. When you're ready, set the timer, and when you start to feel the urge to bail or make a joke, just notice it, and let's keep going.

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll do it now. Door's closed, phone on do‑not‑disturb, timer set for five minutes, and I promised myself a cup of tea after. I'm starting—my chest's tight and I might try to joke or drift, so call me on it if I do. I don't know if I'll keep going, but I'm trying.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: You've taken that first step. When you notice your chest tightening, or the urge to joke or drift, I'll be here to notice it too. No judgment, just noticing what's happening. What would it be like to *not* make that joke, or to *not* drift away – just to keep moving forward for those five minutes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I didn't make the joke I'd just sit there and let my hand move, even if it's tiny—maybe the tightness would ease a bit. My brush is hovering and my chest's tight, but I'm trying to keep going, so please call me out if I start deflecting or go quiet.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Your hand is moving – even if it's tiny. That's what matters, not the size of the move. And when you notice the tightness, you're already noticing it – that's a small step. I'll be here with you, not to fix it, but to notice what happens when you sit with it. What would it be like to take that tiny movement – even if it's just with your hand – and see what happens to the tightness?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let my hand move a bit the tightness might ease—my shoulders could drop a little and my breath might get a touch deeper. But I'm already half‑ready to drift or make a stupid joke, so can you stay with me for a bit and call me out if I start to bail?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: Your hand is moving – it's small, but it's moving. And when you notice the potential for the tightness to ease, that's a good thing to notice. I'm here with you, not to fix it, but to notice what happens when you notice it. When you feel the urge to drift or make a joke, I'll be here to notice it too – not to stop you, but to notice what's happening right now.

Patient: I don't know... my hand's still moving a little, just tiny strokes, and my chest feels a touch looser—like I did something, even if it's dumb. I'm kind of wiped and already want to make a joke to get away, so please call me on it if I start to drift or go quiet.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: You did something – even if it felt small. That's what matters. And when you notice the urge to make a joke, I'll be here to notice it too. You're already noticing it, which is a small step. What would it be like to just hold onto that tiny movement – the brush strokes – for just one more second?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I held it one more second my shoulders might drop a little and the breath would soften, like a tiny relief. My brain's already lining up a joke to bail, so can you nudge me if I start to drift?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: You're noticing the possibility of relief – that's what matters. And when your brain starts lining up a joke, I'll gently nudge you back – not to stop the joke, but to notice what's happening when you notice it. Instead of "Oh, I should bail," what if you said "Oh, I'm noticing the joke again"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try that — when the joke bubbles up I'll say to myself, "Oh, I'm noticing the joke again." My chest's still tight and I might blurt something, so please nudge me if I start to bail.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: You're taking it one step further – noticing the joke again, even when it's trying to bubble up. When you feel the urge to blurt something, I'll be here to nudge you gently back – not to stop the joke, but to notice what's happening when you notice it. What would it be like to say "Oh, I'm noticing the joke again" *before* you blurt something?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying "Oh, I'm noticing the joke again" before I blurt—maybe it would slow me down a bit. It feels awkward to say out loud and my instinct's to fidget or change the subject, so can you actually nudge me if I start to do that?
