Patient: I'm a manager and I've been drowning myself in work lately—longer hours, more projects—not because there's objectively more to do but because busyness numbs the grief I should be feeling. There's been significant family conflict around the loss, and instead of sitting with sadness I catch myself rationalizing and elaborating theories about attachment and avoidance to keep an emotional distance.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing a pattern where busyness becomes a way to avoid feeling the weight of your grief. When that happens, what matters most to you right now—like being able to be present with your family, or finding a way to heal—that feels like it's slipping further away.

Patient: I care about both being present with my family and actually healing, but it feels like the former is slipping away as I default to busyness. I can intellectualize it—call it avoidance, attachment anxiety, affective dysregulation—but that analysis functions like a shield; it's easier than actually feeling the sadness or confronting the conflict. So I end up knowing what matters and still not really inhabiting it.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a gap between knowing what matters to you and actually showing up with that feeling. When the analysis feels like a shield, what would it be like to step aside from that "knowing" for just a moment – not to change what's true, but to make room for the sadness that matters?

Patient: If I step aside from the "knowing," theoretically I'd be making space for affect tolerance — letting a low, persistent ache or tightness in the chest be there without immediately translating it into concepts. In reality that feels threatening; my reflex is to intellectualize, to map the grief onto attachment theory so I can keep some semblance of control. I don't actually know how to let that ache be present without narrating it, and that uncertainty itself feels... unsettling.

Therapist: That tightness in the chest sounds like a place where you'd rather not be – not because it's bad, but because it feels like losing control. When you notice that uncertainty about letting the ache be present, what's the smallest thing you could do with that feeling right now, even if it meant not knowing exactly what would happen?

Patient: Maybe a micro-experiment: set a five-minute timer in the middle of the day, close my laptop, rest a hand on my chest, and simply notice the sensations and breath—labeling them briefly (tightness, heaviness) and rating intensity on a 0–10 scale instead of turning them into a theory. I can already feel the reflex to intellectualize, which makes me anxious, but I could commit to catching that narrativizing and gently bringing attention back to the body.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to experiment with small, tangible steps – even if it means tolerating some uncertainty. What matters most to you about this tiny act of noticing your body, even when your mind wants to narrate – is that a small opening to being present with your family's conflict.

Patient: What matters is that it's a low-stakes experiment in interoceptive awareness—a way to recalibrate my affective baseline so grief doesn't automatically cue the reflexive flight into busyness. If I can tolerate five minutes of embodied feeling, maybe I can scale that into actually being present with my family instead of defaulting to performance and work. That all sounds tidy as a concept, but I'm already noticing the urge to turn it into a framework instead of feeling it, and the idea of being exposed like that makes me anxious.

Therapist: It sounds like the concept itself feels like a safe distance from the actual anxiety – like you're holding onto it to avoid the uncertainty of being present with that feeling. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the concept, you could just notice the tightness in your chest right now, even as you think "I need to hold onto this idea" – and see what happens if you let that tightness be there for just a moment, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Right now there’s a kind of tightness just below my ribs, maybe a 4 out of 10, like a mild pressure that wants to be translated into a plan. I can already feel my brain heading into meta-analysis—how noticing this would affect my work rhythms, family interactions, attachment patterns—so the uncomfortable part is that I don’t know if I can let the sensation exist without turning it into another project, and that uncertainty itself feels... unnerving.

Therapist: It sounds like the uncertainty about letting the sensation exist is actually what's making it hard to notice it – not the sensation itself. What if, instead of trying to know what would happen if you let that tightness be there, you could just ask yourself: "What matters most to me right now, not about what might happen, but about what's already here?"

Patient: What matters most right now is actually tolerating this present ache enough to be available to my family—being less reflexively avoidant and more anchored in what’s here. At the same time my reflex is to reframe it in psychological terms because that makes it feel manageable; admitting that I want something simpler—just to feel sad without turning it into a plan—already feels risky. So I guess I'm trying to hold both: the intellectual map and the messy, inefficient experience, and that tension is where I get stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto both the idea that reframing might make it more manageable and the actual feeling of being stuck – like you're trying to hold onto two different things at once. What if you could notice that tension without trying to make it go away?

Patient: If I tried to notice the tension without fixing it, I'd feel exposed—like the scaffolding of analysis and schedules that keeps me upright is being removed. My reflex is instant: categorize it, make a plan, schedule a five‑minute experiment so it's still a project. There's a queasy vulnerability under that—fear that if I stop narrating I'll be swept away by sadness—but I also get a quiet, stubborn part that wants to see what happens if I don't intervene.

Therapist: It sounds like that queasy vulnerability is actually connected to the quiet, stubborn part that wants to see what happens if you don't intervene – like there's a small, steady voice that's trying to push through the fear. What if you could lean into that tiny voice, even if it's just for a moment, without trying to fix it or make it bigger?

Patient: I think I could try to lean into that tiny voice—it's this faint whisper under all the busyness that I usually talk around. Maybe I'll rest a hand on my chest for a minute and just notice whatever comes, but my words already feel heavy and I'm not sure I can stay with it—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing that the weight of your words is making it hard to stay with the tiny voice. Let's take a deep breath together and slow down just a tiny bit more. What if, instead of trying to notice what's "coming" – whatever that might be – you could just rest your hand on your chest and say to yourself: "I'm here, with this feeling, for just a moment"?

Patient: Okay—I'll try that. Hand on chest now; there's a low, steady pressure around a 3 and saying "I'm here, with this feeling, for just a moment" makes it loosen a bit, though my brain's already lining up observations and contingencies. I don't know if I can hold this for long—can we slow down a little more?

Therapist: It sounds like the loosening is still happening, but your brain's trying to pull you back in. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the loosening, you could just notice it – even if it's just for a second – and then gently say to yourself: "I'm here, with this feeling, again"?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try that. Saying "I'm here, with this feeling, again" with my hand on my chest makes the pressure drop to about a 2 and there’s a tiny sliver of space, but my mind is already running contingency analyses and scheduling this as another experiment. I don't know how long I can hold it without it becoming a project—can we slow down a bit more?

Therapist: It sounds like the space is still small, but it's there. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the space or the feeling, you could just notice that your mind is running with those thoughts – like they're passing through without really taking hold? You could say to yourself: "My mind is noticing that story, and it's not really in charge right now."

Patient: Okay—"My mind is noticing that story, and it's not really in charge right now." Saying that creates a small decentering, like a cognitive buffer, which helps soften the reflex to overplan. Even so it still feels a bit performative—my reflex is to map it onto metacognitive theory instead of actually sitting with the feeling, and my words feel heavy—can we slow down and try it a couple more times, quietly?

Therapist: It sounds like the decentering is helping, but the heaviness of your words is still there. Let's try to quiet that down, just for a moment. *pauses* What if, instead of trying to map the story onto metacognitive theory, you could just say to yourself: "I'm here, with this feeling, again" – and this time, just notice the weight of your words for a second, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I said "I'm here, with this feeling, again." There's a small easing, pressure down to maybe a 1, but my head's already cataloguing it as another intervention. Can we just... pause quietly for a minute so it doesn't get converted into a project?

Therapist: *pauses quietly with you*

Patient: The quiet actually helped—the pressure's down to about a 1 and there's this thin, fragile space, but I'm pretty drained and my words feel heavy. Can we linger in this silence a bit longer? I keep wanting to intellectualize it into a plan and I don't want to do that right now.

Therapist: *continues to pause quietly with you*

Patient: The silence is fragile and I'm pretty wiped—my words feel cumbersome and my brain keeps nudging me to narrativize this into a manageable model. I want to stay here but I'm anxious I'll default to work to avoid it; can we linger a bit more so I don't immediately turn this into another project? I don't have much energy, and that feels both vulnerable and a little scary.

Therapist: *continues to hold the pause with you, not adding anything*

Patient: I don't have the energy to keep talking—there's that low, fragile feeling in my chest and I can already feel the pull to dive back into work to avoid it. Can we sit quietly a bit longer, or could you guide one slow, grounding breath with me so I don't immediately turn this into another project?

Therapist: *takes one slow, deep breath with you: inhales for a count of 4, holds for 2, exhales for 4*

Patient: That helped — the pressure eased a bit, maybe down to a 0.5, and my thoughts quieted for a moment. My words still feel heavy and I'm pretty drained; I can feel the pull to make this into a plan. Could we do one more slow breath together, or just sit quietly for a bit so I don't immediately slip back into work?

Therapist: *takes one more slow, deep breath with you: inhales for a count of 4, holds for 2, exhales for 4*

Patient: One more slow breath with you would help—inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 4. There's still this low ache and the urge to turn it into a plan is loud, but sitting here with you is stopping me from diving back into work right away. I don't have much energy to keep talking, but I want to stay here a bit longer.

Therapist: *takes one more slow, deep breath with you: inhales for a count of 4, holds for 2, exhales for 4*

Patient: That helped—the ache eased, maybe down to about a 0.4, and my reflex to narrativize quieted for a moment. I don't have much energy left and I really don't want to convert this into another project; could we sit quietly a bit longer or do one more slow breath together? I'm not sure I can keep from slipping back into work if we stop.

Therapist: It seems like you're feeling a sense of exhaustion and resistance to leaving the quiet space. *pauses* Would you be willing to try one more tiny step – not to change anything, but just to notice what happens when you take a moment to pause again, even if it's just for a heartbeat?

Patient: Okay — I can try one more tiny pause. There's that faint ache again and my mind's already lining up contingencies, but for a single heartbeat I'll just notice it and not try to turn it into a task. Can we pause together for that one beat?

Therapist: *pauses together for one heartbeat*

Patient: That one beat did something — it opened a thin thread I wasn't expecting. The ache feels a little more like a coldness under the sternum instead of an abstract problem to solve, though my brain's already drafting theories about attachment to avoid it. I'm pretty drained and want to stay with this a bit longer — can we sit quietly or do another slow breath together?

Therapist: It sounds like the coldness under your sternum is a bit more tangible than the ache. *pauses* Would you be willing to notice that coldness for just a moment – not to fix it, but to see what it is – while you're still holding onto the quiet space?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try. Placing my hand there now, it’s a thin coldness under the sternum, maybe a 2, a little hollow and distant rather than sharp. My brain’s already whispering avoidance-and-attachment theories, but for now I’ll just notice the sensation and not try to explain it. I’m pretty drained—can we stay quiet with this a bit longer so I don’t rush back into planning?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the coldness with your hand on your sternum – a tangible sensation that's not just a story. *pauses* Would you be willing to stay with that coldness for just a moment longer, while you're still holding onto the quiet space, without trying to fix it or make sense of it?

Patient: Okay—I'll stay with the coldness a bit longer. With my hand there it's about a 1.5, hollow and oddly empty instead of sharp, and beneath it there's this tremor of sadness I usually dodge by making plans. I'm pretty worn out and don't want to turn this into another project—could we just sit quietly together for a while more?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the sadness beneath the coldness, and that it's connected to the feeling of being worn out. *pauses* What would it be like to hold onto this moment, with the coldness and the sadness, for just a little while longer – not to change it, but to see what it is – while you're still holding onto the quiet space?

Patient: Okay — I can try to hold it a little longer. The coldness is thin and hollow under my sternum, with a low tremor of sadness that feels like an empty weight rather than a sharp pain; my reflex is already to name and explain it, but right now it’s just... present. I'm pretty drained and my words feel heavy—could we sit quietly a bit more or take one more slow breath together? I’m worried I’ll slip back into work if we stop too soon.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the emptiness of the sadness, and that it's not a sharp pain – that's a small step. *pauses* What would it be like to notice the emptiness itself, without trying to make sense of it or fill it – just to see what it is, while you're still holding onto the quiet space?

Patient: Noticing the emptiness itself feels like watching a small, quiet hollowness under my sternum—not an object to fix but a mute space that resists interpretation. My reflex is to label it as avoidance or attachment drama, but when I don't, there's a strange fragile relief and also a prickly precarity. I'm pretty spent—can we just sit with that for a bit longer without trying to make it useful?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the fragility and the relief, and that it's connected to not labeling the emptiness – that's a small step. *pauses* What would it be like to sit with that fragile relief, and the prickly precarity, for just a moment – not to change it, but to see what it is – without trying to make it useful or fix it?

Patient: It would feel like a tiny fissure opening in the liminal space I usually shore up—the relief is thin and the precarity prickles, and instead of filling or explaining it I could try just to rest in the not‑knowing. My reflex to narrativize is already loud, so I'll place my hand on my sternum and breathe slowly and try to notice the sensations without turning them into a plan—I’m pretty drained, so can we sit quietly for a bit or take one slow breath together?
