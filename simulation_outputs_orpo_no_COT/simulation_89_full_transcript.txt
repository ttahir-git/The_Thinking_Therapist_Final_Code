--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm a nurse in my mid‑fifties, and since the kids moved out I've been flooded with sadness and can't muster the motivation to do much, and it's spilling over into my marriage. I keep seeing the worst — that I'll never find purpose again, he'll get fed up and leave, I'll end up alone and so distracted I'll even mess up at work and everything will just fall apart.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios show up really strongly for you right now, and it's like they're filling the space where purpose and connection used to be. Can you take a moment to notice what would happen if, even for just 30 seconds, you made room for one of those thoughts instead of letting it take over?

Patient: If I let it sit for 30 seconds my brain instantly goes into this runaway movie: he gets fed up and leaves, I start screwing up at work from being distracted, get disciplined or fired, can't pay the bills, lose the house — it just spirals and I can't turn it off. My chest tightens, my hands tremble, I breathe shallow and then I'm useless for the rest of the day. I know it sounds extreme, but honestly I can't picture any other outcome — the nicer ones feel like pretending.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It feels like that mental picture is a very real, very urgent one for you right now. It sounds like the worry about being alone and not being able to take care of things is what matters most – it's not just about the thoughts themselves, but what they're connected to: being able to feel safe and capable in your marriage and at work. When you notice that chest tightening and trembling, what would it be like to hold that feeling – even the tightness – for just a moment while you tried to imagine one small step you could take toward feeling more connected to your work or your marriage?

Patient: I try to hold it, but my chest tightens and the movie starts: if I try one small thing, like asking him to have coffee, I can already see him brush me off, resent me, and that tiny rejection spirals into him leaving. Or if I try to re-engage at work, I get distracted, make a mistake, get written up, then fired and everything collapses. I get that you want me to imagine other outcomes, but those nicer ones feel like pretending — I'm overwhelmed and it's really hard to slow this down.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to hold the tightness and imagining small steps feels like it's already leading to more of the same worry and fear – like you're just setting up for another disappointment. When you say "those nicer ones feel like pretending," what if it's not that you're pretending – but rather that when you imagine doing something small, like asking him to have coffee, what matters most to you about that moment isn't the outcome itself, but the connection you'd feel with him while you're talking?

Patient: I really want that connection, I do — but the second I imagine asking him for coffee my brain flips to him brushing me off, us arguing, him leaving, and my chest clamps down. Even if a simple chat might help, I can't make myself believe that's realistic; to me it already looks like the start of everything falling apart.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It feels like the worry about being brushed off or rejected is already so strong that it's hard to imagine the possibility of connection at all – even if it's just for a moment. When you notice that chest clamping down, what would it be like to ask yourself: "What matters most to me in this moment – not what I think might happen if I ask for coffee, but what matters if I just make space for that tiny possibility?"

Patient: What matters most is not being abandoned — just feeling seen and connected, even for a minute. But the second I try to make space for that tiny possibility my brain goes full disaster: he brushes me off, we fight, he leaves, I start screwing up at work from being distracted, get written up or fired, can't pay the bills, lose the house — it all spirals. I know that sounds over the top, but the kinder outcome really does feel like pretending, and I'm trying to hold the tightness and imagine otherwise but it's overwhelming, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that desire for connection – feeling seen and not abandoned – is really what matters most, and when you try to imagine making space for that, your brain is just trying to protect you from the pain of what might happen. When you notice the tightness, instead of trying to hold it and imagine otherwise, what would it be like to make room for the tightness *while* you're noticing that desire for connection – not to make it go away, but to see what's there *while* it's still there?

Patient: I try to make room, but the second I notice the want to be seen the movie kicks in: he brushes me off, we argue, he leaves, I start screwing up at work, get written up or fired, can't pay the bills, and lose the house — it feels inevitable. My chest tightens and my hands shake and I can't hold the tightness and that tiny hope at the same time; the kinder outcome really does feel like pretending, so can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without it collapsing.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the movie is still playing, even when you're trying to make room for the desire to be seen – it's like the script is already written, and you're just along for the ride. When you notice the chest tightening and the shaking, what would it be like to pause the movie – just for 5 seconds – and say to yourself, "I'm here with this feeling, and this hope for connection. What matters most right now is not the outcome, but being here with it?"

Patient: I try to say that to myself, but the second I start the line the movie rewinds: five seconds turns into him rolling his eyes, walking out, me panicking at work, getting written up, losing everything. My chest tightens so fast I can't even finish the sentence. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't know how to hold this and not have it collapse.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the movie is rewinding even before you can start saying the words – like it's already happening in your mind before you even try to make space for it. When you notice your chest tightening so fast, what if you could just *watch* that tightening – without trying to stop it or fix it – and then gently say, "I'm here with this feeling"? Not "I'm here with this hope for connection", but just "I'm here with this feeling".

Patient: I try to watch it, I really do, but the moment I say "I'm here with this feeling" the movie zips forward — him walking out, me panicking at work, getting written up, losing everything — and my chest locks up so fast I can't finish the sentence. I'm shaking and I want to stay with it, but it just collapses into the spiral every time, so can we slow down? I don't know how to hold this without it turning into that disaster.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to connect with the feeling, the movie keeps moving forward – like it's already set in motion. When you notice your chest locking up, what if you could just *let* that lock be there – not to fix it, but to see what would happen if you didn't try to stop it? Not to make the spiral stop, but to see if the feeling would be different if you just allowed the lock to be there.

Patient: I tried that — I tried letting the lock be there — but it never just sits. The second I stop fighting it the movie fast-forwards: him walking out, me panicking at the nurses' station, making a stupid mistake, getting written up, fired, bills piling up, losing the house — I even picture myself eating cereal alone in an empty kitchen. It feels like if I don't grab at the feeling it'll sprint away, so I end up collapsing instead. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to watch it without it turning into that disaster.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to let the lock be there, the movie is still moving forward – even if it's just for a moment. When you notice that feeling of needing to grab at it, what if you could try one tiny thing instead of letting the movie run away? Not to stop the disaster, but to see what would happen if you just *looked* at the feeling while it was still there – without trying to change it or fix it.

Patient: I want to try, but even "just looking" feels like opening the floodgate — I can already see five seconds of looking turn into him rolling his eyes and walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a stupid med mistake, getting written up, fired, bills piling up. My chest clamps so fast I can't even steady my breath; I want to try but I'm terrified it'll trigger the whole spiral. Can we slow down? I don't know how to even look without it collapsing.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fear of opening the floodgate is even bigger than the feeling you're trying to look at. When you notice your chest clamping up, what if you could make room for that fear right there – not to change it, but to see what would happen if you stayed with it while you tried to look? Not to stop the spiral, but to see if the fear would be different if you could just be with it, even for a tiny moment.

Patient: I try to make room for the fear, but the second I do my brain jumps into the movie: he walks out, I freak at the nurses' station, make a med mistake, get written up or fired, bills pile up, lose the house — it's like a chain reaction that my chest and hands react to instantly. I want to stay with it but I can't hold the fear and not-let-it-collapse at the same time — my breath goes shallow and I'm shaking. Can we slow down? I don't know how to watch this without it sprinting into that disaster.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to make room for the fear, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your chest and hands shaking, what if you could try something different? Instead of trying to stop the fear, what if you could just notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out – the feeling of it moving in and out of your body – while the movie is still playing?

Patient: I try to notice my breath, I really do, but the second I slow down my brain flips into the movie — him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house and eating cereal alone in an empty kitchen. My chest clamps and my breath goes shallow so fast I can't track it, my hands shake and I just lose the thread. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to notice your breath, it's like your brain automatically starts playing the movie again. When you notice your chest clamping up and your breath going shallow, what if you could just *watch* that feeling for a tiny moment – without trying to change it or fix it? Not to stop the movie, but to see what would happen if you just let it be there, like a whisper in the background, while you tried to notice your breath again.

Patient: I try, but my head feels like it's moving through molasses — I catch a whisper of breath for a beat and then the movie's already racing: him leaving, me zoning at the nurses' station, screwing up, losing everything. My chest clamps, my breath gets stuck, my hands shake... can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the effort to notice your breath is already getting caught up in the movie. When you notice your chest clamping up and your breath getting stuck, what would it be like if you didn't try to *make* room for the whisper of breath – but instead *allowed* it to be there, even if it's just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I try to allow it, but the second I give that tiny permission the movie kicks in — him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house — my breath just vanishes and my chest locks. I want to stay with the whisper, but I can't hold that and the spiral at the same time... can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you give permission for the whisper of breath, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your chest locking up, what if you could try one tiny thing instead of trying to hold both the whisper and the spiral? Not to stop the spiral, but to see what would happen if you just *felt* the locking sensation for a tiny moment, while the whisper of breath was still there – even if it's just for a heartbeat.

Patient: I try to feel it for a beat, but the movie bolts forward — him leaving, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house — my breath just vanishes and I freeze. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to feel the locking sensation, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your breath vanishing and you freeze, what if you could *see* that freezing moment – just as it is – without trying to change it?

Patient: I try to look at the freeze, but it barely registers — a tiny blink — and then the movie's already racing: him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My chest locks, my voice goes flat and small, and I can't hold it — can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even the tiny blink of noticing the freeze is getting caught up in the movie. When you notice your chest locking up and your voice going flat, what would it be like if you didn't try to *make* anything happen – not even noticing that it's happening?

Patient: I can't just not notice — the silence turns into the movie right away: him leaving, me spacing at the nurses' station, making a med error, getting written up or fired, bills stacking, losing the house. My chest tightens, my voice goes small, and I freeze—so can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to not notice, the silence actually gets worse. When you notice your chest tightening and your voice going small, what if you could *be* with that smallness – not trying to change it, not trying to make it go away – but just *being* with it right there?

Patient: I try to be with the smallness, but the second I do the movie kicks in—him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house—and my chest clamps and my voice goes flat. I don't have the energy to hold the feeling and that spiral at the same time… can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to be with the smallness, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your chest clamping up and your voice going flat, what if you could *let* the smallness be there – not to change it, not to make it go away – but to notice what's already there, even when the movie is playing?

Patient: I try to let the smallness be, but the moment I do the movie blasts forward—him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My head's heavy and I just don't have the energy to hold the feeling and that spiral at the same time… can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to let the smallness be, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your head feeling heavy and you don't have the energy to hold everything, what if you could just *let go* of trying to hold it – not to let go of the feeling, but to let go of the need to control it?

Patient: I try to let go of the need to control it, but the moment I loosen my grip the movie kicks in — him leaving, me messing up at the nurses' station, getting written up, losing the house. My head feels so heavy and everything drains out of me when that starts; I can't seem to let go without it collapsing. Can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you loosen your grip, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your head feeling heavy and everything draining out of you, what if you could *see* that draining sensation – not as something that's happening to you, but as something that's already happening *while* you're trying to let go?

Patient: I try to look at the draining feeling, but the second I notice it the movie spikes: him walking out, me spacing at the nurses' station, making a med error, getting written up, fired, bills stacking, losing the house — like it's inevitable. My head feels like lead and I can't hold that and try to let go at the same time… can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the draining feeling is actually making things worse. When you notice your head feeling like lead and you can't hold everything, what if you could just *pause* for a tiny moment – not to notice the draining, not to notice the movie, but just to *pause* between the two?

Patient: I try to pause — I really try — but it hardly lasts: the movie explodes into him leaving, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My chest clamps, my breath vanishes, my head goes leaden and I can't hold the pause — I just collapse into that spiral. I'm drained and I don't know what to do next… can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the pause itself is actually getting caught up in the movie. When you notice your chest clamping up, your breath vanishing, and your head going leaden, what if you could *watch* that feeling – not to change it, not to fix it, but just to see what's happening right there – even when you're already feeling like you're collapsing?

Patient: I try to watch it, but it barely takes a blink before the movie explodes — him walking out, me spacing at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My chest clamps, my voice goes thin, and I just feel too drained to hold it—can we slow down? I don't know how to watch this without it collapsing.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to watch it, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your chest clamping up and your voice going thin, what if you could *let* that feeling be there – not to change it, but to see what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be, even if it feels like it's already happening?

Patient: I try to let it be, but the second I give it a moment the movie locks in — he'll walk out, I'll zone at the nurses' station, make a med error, get written up or fired, bills pile up and I'll end up alone in that empty kitchen. My head feels like lead and I can't hold that and the fear at the same time… can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to let it be, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie gets locked in. When you notice your head feeling like lead and you can't hold everything, what if you could *be* with the fear – not to change it, not to make it go away, but to see what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there, right next to the movie, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I try to be with the fear like you say, but the moment I give it any space my head runs the whole disaster movie—him walking out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med mistake, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My chest tightens, my voice goes thin, my head feels like lead and I just don't have the energy to hold the fear and that spiral at the same time… can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to be with the fear, it's like your brain automatically tries to fix the problem – the movie starts playing again. When you notice your chest tightening, your voice going thin, and your head feeling like lead, what if you could *just pause* for a tiny moment – not to notice the fear, not to notice the movie, but just to pause between the two?

Patient: I try to pause, I really do, but it barely holds — the moment I catch my breath the movie snaps on: him storming out, me zoning at the nurses' station, making a med error, getting written up or fired, bills piling up, losing the house. My chest clamps, my voice goes thin, my head turns to lead and I just fold into that spiral… can we slow down? I don't know how to hold even a tiny pause without it collapsing.
