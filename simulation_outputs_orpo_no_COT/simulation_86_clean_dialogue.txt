Patient: Honestly, I've been circling this persistent sense of demoralization and motivational attenuation since the layoffs and ongoing job instability, and it's starting to bleed into my relationship. I can intellectualize it—link it to my PTSD, hypervigilance giving way to avoidance—but that schema-mapping doesn't actually restore my initiative. I'm usually action-oriented and extroverted, so it's frustrating and disorienting that I can't marshal the same energy anymore.

Therapist: What happens when you try to notice that "demoralization" feeling *while* you're sitting with the thought "I'm usually action-oriented and extroverted"?

Patient: It turns into a cognitive tug-of-war—I immediately start cataloguing explanations (PTSD, role loss, reward-system attenuation) instead of actually sitting with the feeling. That analysis becomes a buffer; I distance myself, turn the demoralization into an abstract concept rather than admitting it feels heavy or slow. It's frustrating—my reflex is to theorize instead of feel or act, and then I end up blaming myself for being stuck.

Therapist: That sounds like a familiar pattern. What would happen if you could *notice* that analysis happening, without trying to push it away or change it—just for a moment, while you're still sitting with the heaviness?

Patient: I think it'd create a small meta-gap—an observational space where the heaviness could be recognized instead of being rewritten into another theory. Practically, though, when I try I notice a tightness behind my sternum and a kind of slow, leaden fatigue in my limbs, and my reflex is to immediately generate another causal model to avoid the vulnerability. I'm afraid that if I stay in that gap I might start to cry or feel exposed, so the analysis kicks back in as a protective maneuver.

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations *do* matter to you, and that feeling vulnerable might be connected to a deeper value. What would it be like to make room for that tightness and fatigue, even as the analysis shows up—without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: On paper, letting that tightness and fatigue have space sounds like it could be salutary—maybe I'd access the real sorrow and that would recalibrate whatever's stalled inside me. In practice it feels like stepping off a cliff: the tightness probably becomes a sobbing mess and I'm terrified that'll make me look weak to my partner or useless at work, so my brain manufactures another elegant explanation to keep me functional. I want to try making room, I'm just jittery about how to do it without imploding or losing control.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of what might happen if you let go of that control is really strong. What if, instead of trying to avoid the mess, you made room for it *while* noticing that it's connected to the value of being present for your partner and doing your work?

Patient: Theoretically I get it—holding the mess while naming that it connects to my value of being present could ground me rather than derail me—but my reflex is to immediately erect another explanatory scaffold because vulnerability feels like a threat to my competence. When I imagine actually doing it, my chest tightens and I get jittery, so I start running scenarios instead of staying with the feeling. I want to try, but I need a concrete, small-step way to make room that doesn't feel like I'm about to implode—what might that look like for someone who habitually intellectualizes?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you made room for the feeling *right now*, even if it meant not knowing exactly what would happen next?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to imagine making room for it now, but even that phrasing activates my analytic reflex: it sounds like a contradiction in terms, like a controlled experiment about being uncontrolled. Right now I can feel the tightness in my chest and a kind of anticipatory scenario-running; I'm jittery and honestly afraid I'll start crying and then be judged as incompetent. Could you give me a concrete micro-step I could actually do in the next minute or two that feels tolerable, not like I'm stepping off a cliff?

Therapist: Can you notice that tightness in your chest, right now, while you're still sitting here, without trying to change it or analyze it? Just notice it *as you're noticing it*.

Patient: Okay—I'm trying to notice the tightness as I'm noticing it. There's a low, constricting pressure under my sternum, my breath is shallow and my limbs feel a bit leaden, and simultaneously a part of me is already spinning causal narratives to neutralize the vulnerability. Acknowledging that reflex—this meta-awareness—feels a touch relieving, but also shoots a jittery spike of fear that I'll be judged if I let it expand.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to change the narrative or push it away, you made room for the *noticing* itself, even with the fear?

Patient: That suggestion actually makes sense conceptually—taking a meta-attentional stance feels like a less threatening form of exposure, more observational than surrender. Right now, noticing that I'm noticing gives a small, almost disciplinary relief, but it also sparks a prickling anxiety in my chest and a hot flush behind my eyes that my instinct is to rationalize away. Can you give me one very small, concrete step—like a 30-second noticing exercise or a phrase to say silently—that feels safe to try right now?

Therapist: Instead of pushing the anxiety away, what if you simply said to yourself: "This tightness is here, right now"?

Patient: Okay — I tried it internally: "This tightness is here, right now." Saying it felt almost clinical, like labeling a symptom on a spreadsheet, and that label loosens the grip a little—the pressure's still there but it didn't immediately fling me into worst-case scenario planning. Still, my inner commentator immediately starts judging—what will my partner think, what does this mean for my competence—so I get this reflex to intellectualize it away. Can we try one very short anchoring step I can do now, like one slow exhale while repeating the phrase, so it doesn't feel like I'm stepping off a cliff?

Therapist: When you feel that urge to intellectualize it away, what if you paired the phrase "This tightness is here, right now" with a small, physical action that's just *one* thing you could do—like taking one slow, slow breath out *while* saying it?

Patient: I tried it — one slow exhale while saying to myself, "This tightness is here, right now." It actually took a sliver of the edge off; the pressure under my sternum eased a notch and my breath felt a hair deeper, but of course my brain immediately started narrating all the implications (what my partner will think, what this means for my competence). It felt tolerable, not catastrophic, but I'm jittery about letting it sit—can we try one more tiny, concrete step so it doesn't just become another intellectual ritual?

Therapist: When you notice the narrative showing up, what if you simply *let* the thought be there for a moment—*before* trying to push it away or change it—without doing anything about it?

Patient: I tried letting a thought like "my partner will think I'm weak" just sit, and honestly it felt less like a cliff and more like a smudge — slightly less urgent. Predictably, my defensive cognition immediately launched a whole catalogue of rationales and hypothetical outcomes to reassert control, which makes me want to do something to fix it. Can we run a very small, bounded experiment—I'll name the thought once, take five slow breaths, and then check in with how the chest feels—so it doesn't feel like I'm stepping off a cliff?

Therapist: Let's do that experiment. When you notice that thought, "my partner will think I'm weak", what if you simply named it once, and then took those five slow, slow breaths—just five, not trying to change it or push it away, just noticing the space between your breaths—*while* you were still sitting with the thought?

Patient: I named it once—"my partner will think I'm weak"—and took five slow, deliberate breaths, paying attention to the little spaces between each inhale and exhale. By the third exhale the tightness under my sternum eased a notch and my breath felt a bit fuller, which was...surprising and oddly relieving, but my inner analyst immediately started re-framing it as a temporary physiological artifact. I'm sitting with a mix of relief and embarrassment—relief it didn't implode, embarrassment that I still want to intellectualize it away—so I'm jittery about just letting it be. Can we do one more tiny, concrete step now, maybe adding a brief grounding action so it doesn't just become another mental ritual?

Therapist: When you notice the re-framing thought, "it's just a temporary physiological artifact", what if you simply turned your attention to the sensation of your feet on the ground, even just for a moment?

Patient: I did it — I focused on my feet and felt the heels and balls pressing into the floor, a slight coolness at the arches and a real sense of weight and grounding that made the rest of me feel a little steadier. That noticing softened the tightness in my chest a notch, though my inner commentator already labeled it a neat little "CBT maneuver" to avoid the real work. I'm a bit relieved but still jittery — can we do one more tiny step, like keeping my feet grounded while I take three slow breaths and then check how the chest feels?

Therapist: Let's keep your feet grounded while you breathe. When you feel the anxiety showing up, "I'm avoiding the real work", what if you simply took three slow breaths, noticing the sensation of your feet and the space between your breaths—*before* trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I did the three slow breaths with my feet planted—by the second exhale the chest loosened a bit and my breath felt marginally fuller, though part of me immediately reclassified it as a nifty little behavioral intervention. I'm embarrassed that I keep translating feeling into technique, so can we try one more micro-step: have me say one single-word label—like "sad"—out loud once while keeping my feet grounded and taking one slow breath, just to see what that does?

Therapist: When you notice that thought, "I'm avoiding the real work", what if you simply said the word "sad" out loud, just once, while keeping your feet grounded and taking one slow breath—*before* trying to do anything about it?

Patient: I said "sad" out loud once with my feet grounded and took one slow breath. It felt a bit performative—like a clinical label—but also there was a subtle loosening under my sternum and a warm prickliness behind my eyes, which is new and a little disorienting. My inner analyst immediately tried to reclassify it as a behavioral artifact, so I feel embarrassed and jittery, but also curious. What's a very small, safe next step I can do to stay with that little opening without letting my analysis take over?

Therapist: When you notice that sense of curiosity, what if you simply *followed* the warmth in your eyes—*just for a moment*—without trying to analyze it or change it?

Patient: I followed the warmth for a few seconds and felt a subtle welling behind my eyes and a soft loosening in my chest—almost like an autonomic downregulation, but not fully into tears. My reflex immediately tried to lexicalize it—call it a parasympathetic rebound or an affective discharge—because naming it keeps it at arm’s length. It’s curious and oddly tender, but also scary in terms of losing composure or being judged, so can you give me one very small, safe next step to stay with this without it becoming another analytics exercise?

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I don't want to lose composure", what if you simply *made room* for the warmth in your eyes—*while* you were still noticing the thought—without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I tried making room for the warmth while holding that thought—there was a gentle prickling behind my eyes and my chest softened a bit, like something unlatched, but my mouth went tight and my brain immediately tried to reframe it as an "affective discharge" to keep it at arm's length. I'm equal parts relieved and embarrassed—relieved it didn't implode, embarrassed that I keep narrativizing the whole thing so I don't actually feel it. Can you give me one very small, safe next step—something I can do with my hands or a single phrase to say silently—so I don't default back into analysis?

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I don't want to lose composure", what if you simply *let the tightness in your mouth be there—*while* you made room for the warmth in your eyes—without trying to change it?

Patient: I did it — I let the tightness in my mouth be there while making room for the warmth in my eyes. My jaw eased a notch, a small dampness gathered and my chest softened, and of course my brain immediately labeled it an "affective leakage" to keep it at arm’s length. I'm feeling exposed and a bit embarrassed, and I don't want to default back into analysis — can we try one tiny, safe grounding thing I can do with my hands right now so I can stay with this?

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I don't want to lose composure", what if you *placed your hand on your heart*—just for a moment—while letting the tightness in your mouth be there and the warmth in your eyes?

Patient: I put my hand on my heart — there’s a steady warmth and my pulse feels oddly reassuring, my chest softened and a small dampness gathered at the eyes, but my reflexive analyst immediately tried to narrativize it into something clinical. I feel exposed and a little embarrassed, and part of me wants to explain it away instead of sitting with it. Can we do one more very small step — keep my hand there and have me silently say “I’m here” three times on slow breaths, just to see what that does?

Therapist: Let's keep your hand on your heart and try that. When you're ready, say "I'm here" to yourself on slow breaths, noticing the sensation of your hand on your heart, the warmth, the dampness, and the tightness in your mouth—*without trying to change it*.

Patient: I said “I’m here” three times on slow breaths with my hand on my heart. The warmth under my palm is steady and my chest did soften; there’s a little dampness at my eyes but my mouth stayed tight and my brain immediately started reclassifying it as a “regulated affective expression” to keep it at arm’s length. I feel oddly grounded and embarrassed at the same time—can we do one tiny, concrete next thing I can do with my hands so I don’t slip back into analysis?

Therapist: Let's keep your hand on your heart. Can you notice the sensation of your fingers on the palm of your hand—where the weight of your hand is most—while saying to yourself, "I'm here" just one more time?

Patient: I did it — I felt the weight of my fingers at the base of my palm, said “I’m here” once, and there was a small settling: my chest eased, a warmth under my hand, a little dampness at the eyes. Of course my inner commentator already tried to recast it as an elegant affect-regulation maneuver, which makes me embarrassed and jittery. Can we do one very small, concrete next step — like loosening my jaw one notch while keeping my hand there for one slow breath — so it doesn't just become another intellectual exercise?

Therapist: Let's try loosening your jaw just a bit while keeping your hand on your heart. As you exhale, notice the sensation of your jaw relaxing, just one notch, and stay with that sensation for one slow breath.

Patient: I loosened my jaw a notch as I exhaled — there’s a subtle unclenching around my mouth and a faint warmth under my hand, like a small permission to soften. Of course my inner analyst immediately branded it a "regulatory micro‑intervention," which makes me feel embarrassed and want to explain it away instead of just... being with it. Can we do one more tiny, bounded step—like keeping the jaw relaxed while I count or breathe for 30 seconds—so it doesn't just turn into another intellectual ritual?

Therapist: Let's try something different. As you notice the warmth under your hand and the loosened jaw, *without trying to change it*, can you simply *count backwards from 10* while keeping your hand there, noticing the sensation of your jaw and the warmth?

Patient: I counted backwards from ten with my hand on my heart — around six I noticed my jaw loosen a bit more, the warmth steadied and there was a small dampness behind my eyes; my chest felt a touch less constricted. Predictably, my reflexive analyst tried to reframe it as a tidy grounding protocol, which makes me feel embarrassed and a little protective. Can we do one more very small, bounded step—something with my hands or a single-word prompt—to help me stay with this instead of immediately narrativizing it?

Therapist: Let's try a small, physical prompt. As you notice the dampness behind your eyes, can you *place your index finger gently on the corner of your mouth*, right where your jaw is relaxed, and stay with that sensation for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I put my index finger on the corner of my mouth. It's weirdly grounding: a cool, focused pressure, my jaw loosens a bit, there's more dampness behind my eyes and my chest is marginally less tight, but my inner commentator already dubbed it a "sensorimotor cue" so I feel embarrassed. Can we keep my finger there and try two slow breaths, then check how the chest and the embarrassment feel?

Therapist: Let's keep your finger there. As you notice the cool pressure, take two slow, slow breaths, and then notice how the chest feels—*not the embarrassment, just the sensation of it—*while your finger is still there.

Patient: I did it — two slow, slow breaths with my finger on the corner of my mouth. My chest loosened a bit, a warm steadiness under my hand, and there’s more dampness behind my eyes; it actually felt grounding, not dramatic. Of course my inner analyst immediately labeled it another "sensorimotor cue" and I feel embarrassed and twitchy to explain it away, but there's a small opening. Can we try one more tiny, concrete step with my hands so I can stay with this without defaulting to narration?

Therapist: Let's try one more tiny thing. With your finger still on the corner of your mouth, can you *gently touch the tip of your finger to the tip of your nose*, and then notice what happens while you're doing that?

Patient: I did it — touching my finger to my nose is weirdly precise and grounding: a cool, focused pressure and this small sensory tether that makes my jaw loosen a bit more and my chest soften. There's more dampness behind my eyes, but of course my inner commentator already labeled it a "tactile anchor" so I feel embarrassed and reflexively want to explain it away. Can we do one more tiny, concrete step — like keep the finger there and do three slow exhales, or another simple action I can actually do without turning it into theory?
