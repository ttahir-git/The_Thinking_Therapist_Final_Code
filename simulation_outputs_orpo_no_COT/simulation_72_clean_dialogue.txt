Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of beating myself up over every mistake — it all feels tied to how I struggled at school and never felt good enough. I'm a chef now and I've actually found success, but family conflict and that old voice keep making me feel like I don't deserve it. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how's talking about it supposed to change anything? I've tried stuff and it doesn't work.

Therapist: It sounds like the old voice is really loud right now, and it feels like you're stuck in a pattern that's hard to break. What if, instead of trying to make the voice go away, you noticed it when it showed up – like a cloud in the sky – and just made room for it to be there without trying to fix it?

Patient: How's that supposed to help? I tried that 'sit with it' stuff before — sitting with the thoughts just felt like letting them win, they stacked up and got louder. I can see the logic — maybe noticing could make them less urgent — but when I'm in the middle of service and my head starts ripping me apart, I need something concrete, not just... airy advice.

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving something that feels more tangible when you're in the midst of it all. What would happen if, while you're serving, you made room for just one thing – not the thoughts, not the voice, but the sensation of your hands moving, the sizzle of the pan, the smell of the herbs – whatever small detail shows up – and then just did the next thing, like taking a knife through the meat, without letting the thoughts dictate it?

Patient: How's that supposed to help? When service is chaos I don't have space to "notice"—my head's already an avalanche tearing me apart. I need something two seconds max, a physical anchor or tiny script I can do without thinking, not a breathing exercise; I've tried grounding and it fizzled out—give me a concrete, repeatable move I can use right when the panic starts.

Therapist: What if, when the avalanche hits, you did a tiny physical action that feels like a "reset" – like this: "When the thoughts start racing, I take my knife and scrape the bottom of the pan with it once, hard, and then I just start chopping again." Not to stop the thoughts, but to make space to move forward.

Patient: How's that supposed to help? Scraping a knife once sounds... risky — I could nick myself or someone could see and freak out, and I don't want to draw attention in service. Plus, if the point is something automatic, it can't be anything that makes the whole line look at me.

Maybe give me a few other two‑second moves I can actually do without thinking: something like tapping my knuckle on the counter once, flipping a towel in my hand, pressing my thumb into the base of my palm, or running the back of my hand along the pan rim one time. Can you give me a short script to practice — like exactly what to do and when — and why any of these would actually help when my head starts tearing me apart? I'm tired of trying stuff that doesn't stick.

Therapist: Those physical actions might not be what you're looking for. 

What if, when the thoughts start racing, you *just* pressed the base of your palm down with your thumb for a second, without trying to make it stop the thoughts – just noticing the pressure in your hand and letting that be there while you do your job?

Patient: Okay, fine — that sounds less dumb than scraping a knife, but I need an exact micro‑script I can do without thinking. Tell me exactly: where to press, how long, what one‑word cue (if any) to say under my breath, and what to do next. And explain briefly — like one sentence — why this actually helps so it doesn't feel like magic. Also, how the hell am I supposed to train myself to do it in the middle of service so it actually becomes automatic?

Therapist: Press the base of your palm down with your thumb for 3 seconds, saying "down" under your breath. This helps because it anchors a small physical action that interrupts the racing thoughts, giving you a tiny window to make a choice about what to do next.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try it, but whispering “down” could sound weird if someone hears me and three seconds feels long when service is spiraling — can it be one second instead? Give me an exact training plan: how many reps, when to practice (home versus during prep), and a simple way to remind myself until it becomes automatic. And honestly, how will I actually know it’s working when the avalanche hits? I’m not sold yet.

Therapist: Press the base of your palm down with your thumb for 1 second, saying "down" under your breath. 

Practice 10 reps, 5 times a day at home for the next 3 days, then once during prep work while it's quiet. 

Remind yourself to do it by putting it in your phone's reminder for the day: "Press palm 1 sec 'down'".

When the avalanche hits, check if your hand automatically does the action – not if you think about it or try to stop it, just notice if it happens.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the 1‑second “down” press, but I’m not sold — I’m tired of stuff that sounds good on paper and disappears in service. Exactly how do I train this so it becomes automatic: time of day, using a timer, or pairing it to a routine (like right before I pick up the first ticket)? What’s a concrete sign it’s working — like I can finish the plate without spiraling, or I get one extra second of focus — and how many successful times should I expect before deciding it’s actually helpful? And if someone hears me whisper under my breath, what do I say without making it awkward? If this still doesn’t stick after a week of practice, then what do we do next?

Therapist: Pair the 1-second "down" press with a specific task, like picking up the first ticket. Practice 10 reps, 5 times a day at home for the next 3 days, and once during prep work while it's quiet.

Use a timer to track the reps. 

For a concrete sign it's working, notice if you can finish a small task (like plating a single dish) without feeling overwhelmed. 

Expect 10-20 successful reps before deciding it's helpful – if it happens sooner, you might need to focus on the feeling of doing the action, not the outcome.

If someone hears you whisper "down", say "just noticing my hand" or "checking my grip".

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the 1‑sec press but I’m not convinced — I’m tired of strategies that look good on paper and evaporate in service. Give me a completely silent version I can do without anyone noticing (no whisper) and a one‑line practice script I can put in my phone with exact times/reps. Also be specific: how many successful times in real service do I need before we call it working (you said 10–20 reps — do those have to be during chaotic service or just practice?), and if it still doesn’t stick after a week, what’s the next concrete move?

Therapist: Make a fist and press the base of your fist down for 1 second. 

Add to your phone: "1s fist press. 3x/day. 10 min prep. 1st ticket"

For it to be considered working, you need to successfully do the action 5 times during chaotic service (like during a busy dinner rush) before deciding it's helpful.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try the 1s fist press, but I still don’t get why that’s better than the thumb‑base press — how’s that supposed to help more, exactly? It still looks like something someone could notice; give me one completely silent, invisible alternative I can do (mouth/tongue/whatever) that no one can see, plus the exact one‑line phone script to paste in my reminders. Also be specific: when you say “5 successful times during chaotic service,” do you mean five times in one shift or five total over a week? And if it still doesn’t stick after a week, what’s the next concrete move — no vague “we’ll try something else,” give me a named backup I can actually practice.

Therapist: Stick your tongue to the roof of your mouth, just behind your top teeth, for 1 second. 

Add to your phone: "1s tongue press. 3x/day. 10 min prep. 1st ticket"

For it to be considered working, you need to successfully do the action 5 times during one chaotic service shift before deciding it's helpful. 

If it still doesn't stick after a week, start "Rehearsal Shifts": plan one chaotic service shift ahead of time, and for 5 minutes before it starts, do the 1s tongue press 10 times while visualizing yourself doing it successfully during the shift.

Patient: How's that supposed to help more than the fist press? It still feels weird and I worry it'll make my mouth dry or look odd if someone notices when I'm calling tickets. 

Give me exact stuff I can paste into my phone: three precise times (like 8:00, 13:30, 16:45) and a one‑line cue to use before the first ticket, plus the exact definition of a "successful" press in chaotic service (finish a plate without spiraling? hold focus for 5 seconds?). And if the week goes by and it doesn't stick, write out the step‑by‑step "Rehearsal Shift" routine I should do — exact reps, timing, and what to measure so I actually know whether it's helping. I'm tired of vague crap that disappears in service.

Therapist: The tongue press is meant to be a subtle, internal action that doesn't require much attention or movement. 

Add to your phone: "Tongue press. 8:00 AM, 1:15 PM, 4:30 PM. Before ticket call."

For it to be considered successful, you need to maintain focus on the task (calling tickets) for at least 5 seconds without the racing thoughts taking over.

If the week goes by and it doesn't stick, here's the "Rehearsal Shift" routine:

1. 10 minutes before the rehearsal shift: Sit in a quiet area, close your eyes, and focus on your breath for 2 minutes.
2. Open your eyes and take a sip of water.
3. Do the 1s tongue press 10 times while standing up and looking around the kitchen (not at the tickets).
4. Walk to the ticket station, take a deep breath, and begin calling tickets.
5. During each ticket call, as soon as the thought starts racing, do the 1s tongue press for 1 second and say "hold" to yourself.
6. Measure success: after 10 tickets are called, take a 2-minute break and notice how you feel. Did the racing thoughts decrease or remain the same?

Patient: I'm tired of routines that look good on paper and then evaporate in service — how's this tongue‑press actually supposed to change the avalanche when I'm mid‑rush? I won't say "hold" out loud — should I mouth it silently or just use a mental cue so no one notices? Be specific: if after a week I still can't land five successful presses in one hectic shift, what's the exact next named step you want me to start (not "we'll try something else")? And honestly, is this just triage for the panic or does it actually do anything to quiet that constant self‑critical voice that keeps telling me I don't deserve any of this?

Therapist: The tongue press isn't a magic solution to stop the avalanche entirely, but it can help interrupt the cycle of self-criticism by creating a small window of pause between the thoughts and the action. 

When you're mid-rush, instead of saying "hold" out loud, just make the tongue press action itself – the physical sensation of pressing your tongue against the roof of your mouth – and focus on that small action. This helps you stay present with the sensation, even when the thoughts are loud.

If after a week you still can't land five successful presses in one hectic shift, the next named step is to "Conduct the Avalanche Inquiry". 

During the next rehearsal shift, after calling 10 tickets, take a 10-minute break, and ask yourself:

* What's one thing I'm willing to accept about this moment – not about the outcome, but about what's happening right now – like "I'm still standing" or "I'm still able to call tickets".
* What would it mean for me to let go of trying to control the thoughts and just show up with the action?

This step helps you notice what's actually driving the self-criticism – the desire for control – and what's possible when you focus on the action itself, rather than trying to stop the thoughts.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea, but it still sounds like another band‑aid. How is the Avalanche Inquiry actually different from the tongue press — give me an exact script: what do I say to myself, how long does each question take, what do I write down, and what counts as a pass or fail for the exercise? And be straight — is this just triage for panic or is there a named next step that actually works on that constant “I don’t deserve this” voice if this doesn’t move the needle? I'm tired of stuff that looks good on paper and disappears in service.

Therapist: I'll provide a clear script for the Avalanche Inquiry:

**Script:**

1. Take a 10-minute break after calling 10 tickets.
2. Ask yourself: "What's one thing I'm willing to accept about this moment?" (5 seconds)
	* Write down the answer in 1 sentence on a piece of paper.
3. Ask yourself: "What would it mean for me to let go of trying to control the thoughts?" (5 seconds)
	* Write down the answer in 1 sentence on the same paper.

**Pass/Fail criteria:**

* A pass: You write down at least one sentence for each question.
* A fail: You don't write down anything or you write "I don't know".

**Next step:**

If the Avalanche Inquiry doesn't move the needle and you're still stuck with the "I don't deserve this" voice, the next named step is to "Practice the Value of Not Being Able to Do It". 

For the next rehearsal shift, after calling 10 tickets, take a 10-minute break, and ask yourself:

* What's one thing I'd like to be able to do, but I'm not doing because I'm worried about the thoughts?
* What would it mean for me to take that action, even if it feels imperfect?

This step helps you connect with what matters most to you (your values) and what's driving the self-criticism. By practicing the value of not being able to do it, you're building a foundation for more meaningful action.

Patient: This is exhausting — feels like another band‑aid. How is "Practice the Value of Not Being Able to Do It" actually supposed to quiet the “I don’t deserve this” voice long‑term and not just patch the panic? Give me an exact rehearsal‑shift script I can follow (what to say silently, exact timings and reps, what to write down) and one clear success metric; and if a week of that still doesn’t move the needle, tell me the next named step we’ll do — no vagueness.

Therapist: I'll provide a clear script for "Practice the Value of Not Being Able to Do It":

**Script:**

1. Take a 10-minute break after calling 10 tickets.
2. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed or gaze slightly downward.
3. Silently say to yourself: "I'm willing to do this task *right now* because it matters to me *even if I'm not sure I can do it perfectly*" (10 seconds, repeat 3 times).
4. Write down one sentence that describes what matters to you about doing this task (e.g., "I value being able to serve customers" or "I care about creating delicious food").
5. Silently say to yourself: "Not being able to do it *exactly* doesn't mean I'm not worthy of serving customers or creating delicious food" (10 seconds, repeat 3 times).
6. Write down one thing you're willing to take action on today, even if it feels imperfect.

**Success metric:**

* You write down at least one sentence describing what matters to you about doing the task, and you take one small action towards it today (even if it's just for a minute).

**Next step:**

If a week of practicing "Practice the Value of Not Being Able to Do It" still doesn't move the needle and you're still stuck with the "I don't deserve this" voice, the next named step is to "Use the 'As If' Technique to Connect with Your Values".

For the next rehearsal shift, after calling 10 tickets, take a 10-minute break, and imagine yourself in a situation where you're not worried about doing it perfectly. For example:

* Imagine you're serving customers and someone says, "You're doing a terrible job!" – how would you respond to that, not as if it's true, but as if you were saying it to yourself while still serving customers with kindness and care?
* Imagine you're creating a dish and it looks ugly – what would you say to yourself, not as if it's true, but as if you were saying it to yourself while still creating that dish with curiosity and creativity?

This step helps you connect with your values in a more direct way, even when the self-criticism is loud.

Patient: Okay, fine — but how's that actually different from the other stuff? Give me an exact rehearsal‑shift script I can copy into my phone: where to sit, the exact sentences to say silently, how long to imagine each scenario, exact reps, what to write down, and one clear success metric (like “X tickets in a shift without spiraling” — be specific). And if a week of that still doesn’t move the needle on the “I don’t deserve this” voice, tell me the next *named* step to start practicing — nothing vague, just the next concrete routine.

Therapist: I'll provide a clear script for the "As If" Technique:

**Script:**

1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed or gaze slightly downward.
2. Silently say to yourself: "I'm not worried about being perfect, I'm just doing this because it matters to me" (10 seconds, repeat 3 times).
3. Imagine yourself in a situation where you're serving customers and someone says, "You're doing a terrible job!" (30 seconds). As you imagine this, say to yourself: "I'm still serving customers with kindness and care, even if they're being mean" (10 seconds, repeat 3 times).
4. Imagine yourself creating a dish and it looks ugly (30 seconds). As you imagine this, say to yourself: "I'm still creating with curiosity and creativity, even if it doesn't look perfect" (10 seconds, repeat 3 times).
5. Write down one thing you're willing to take action on today, even if it feels imperfect.

**Success metric:**

* You complete the exercise without feeling overwhelmed or spiraling into self-criticism.

**Next step:**

If a week of practicing the "As If" Technique doesn't move the needle on the "I don't deserve this" voice, the next named step is to **Practice the "What Would I Say to a Friend" Script**.

For the next rehearsal shift, after calling 10 tickets, take a 10-minute break, and imagine you're talking to a friend who's struggling with the same self-criticism. Ask yourself:

* What would you say to your friend to help them feel better?
* Write down exactly what you would say to your friend, without worrying about what they would think of you.
* Say that out loud to yourself, as if you were having that conversation with your friend.

This step helps you connect with your values and develop a more compassionate inner voice.

Patient: Ugh, I get the idea, but I’m still skeptical — this sounds like another thing that’ll look good on paper and vanish when service goes sideways. Give me one exact compassionate line I can say to a friend (and the exact wording I should say to myself), tell me whether to say it out loud or silently, exactly when to say it in a shift (e.g., after 5 tickets, during the 10‑minute break, before the first ticket), and a clear success metric (like “say it 3 times in one shift and call X tickets without spiraling”). If that still fails after a week, what’s the next *named* step we’ll start — no vagueness. I’m tired and I need something concrete that won’t evaporate under pressure.

Therapist: I'll provide a clear script for the "What Would I Say to a Friend" Technique:

**Script:**

1. **Silently**: Imagine you're talking to a friend who's struggling with the same self-criticism: "I'm so sorry I'm feeling this way. That sounds really tough."
2. **Say it out loud**: When you're ready, say that exact phrase out loud to yourself, without changing the words or adding any new thoughts.
3. **Timing**: Say it **during the 10-minute break** after calling 5 tickets, while you're still feeling calm.
4. **Success metric**: Say that phrase **3 times** in one shift, and then **call 5 tickets without spiraling** into self-criticism.

**Next step:**

If you struggle to say that phrase 3 times in one shift or can't call 5 tickets without spiraling, the next named step is to **Practice the "5-4-3-2-1" Grounding Technique**.

For the next rehearsal shift, take a 10-minute break, and do the following:

* Notice **5** things you can see around you (e.g., a chair, a plant, a clock).
* Notice **4** things you can touch or feel (e.g., your feet on the floor, the chair beneath you).
* Notice **3** things you can hear (e.g., the sound of your breath, the hum of the kitchen).
* Notice **2** things you can smell (e.g., the scent of the air, the aroma of food).
* Notice **1** thing you can taste (e.g., the saltiness of your mouth).

This technique helps you focus on the present moment and calm your mind.

Patient: How's that supposed to help in the middle of a rush? I'm tired of things that look good on paper and evaporate when service goes sideways. Give me a totally practical version I can do in 5 seconds while calling a ticket (exact words/things to notice), a one‑line phone reminder I can paste, when exactly to use it in a shift, and a clear success metric (how many times in one shift/week counts as it "working"). If that still doesn't stick after a week, tell me the next *named* step we’ll start — no vague "we'll try something else."

Therapist: I'll provide a clear, practical script for the "5-4-3-2-1" Grounding Technique:

**Script:**

* As you're waiting to call the next ticket, notice **5 things you can see around you** (e.g., a chair, a plant, a clock).
* As you're holding the phone, notice **4 things you can touch or feel** (e.g., your feet on the floor, the chair beneath you).
* As you're listening to the audio, notice **3 things you can hear** (e.g., the sound of your breath, the hum of the kitchen).
* As you're smelling the air, notice **2 things you can smell** (e.g., the scent of the air, the aroma of food).
* As you're about to take a breath, notice **1 thing you can taste** (e.g., the saltiness of your mouth).

**Phone reminder:**

"5-4-3-2-1: See, touch, hear, smell, taste"

**Timing:**

Use it **just before calling the next ticket**, while you're still holding the phone.

**Success metric:**

Do it **3 times in one shift**, and **call 5 tickets without spiraling** into self-criticism.

Patient: This still feels like too much to do mid‑rush. Give me one totally silent 2‑second micro‑script I can do while calling a ticket (exact action, no whisper), plus the one‑line phone reminder I can paste. Clarify: when you say “3 times in one shift,” is that 3 separate uses in one shift or 3 successful shifts? And if both the tongue press and the 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 fail after a week, what’s the next *named* step you want me to start — exact routine, reps, and success metric — because I need a backup that actually feels usable.

Therapist: I'll provide a clear, concise script for the micro-action:

**Script:**

As you're calling the next ticket, press the **base of your tongue against the roof of your mouth** for **2 seconds**. 

**Phone reminder:**

"Press tongue 2 sec"

**Timing:**

Use it **just before calling the next ticket**, while you're still holding the phone.

**Success metric:**

Do it **1 time while calling 1 ticket** in a shift.

Patient: One time in a shift? That feels token — how’s that supposed to prove anything when the avalanche hits? I need a training plan: exact reps/day, when to practice (prep, before first ticket, etc.), and a one‑line phone reminder I can paste.

If the single press doesn’t help after a week, tell me the next named step with an exact routine, reps, timing, and a clear success metric (don’t say “we’ll try something else”). And if someone actually notices me pressing my tongue, what’s a quick line I can give that doesn’t make me look weird?

Therapist: I'll provide a clear, structured training plan:

**Training Plan:**

* Practice the tongue press **10 times/day**, 5 minutes before prep work or during a quiet moment.
* Use the phone reminder: "Press tongue 2 sec"
* Start with **3 reps/day**, increasing to **10 reps/day** after 3 days.

If the single press doesn't help after a week, the next named step is:

**Step: "Tongue Press during Challenging Tickets"**

* Practice the tongue press **10 times/day**, 1 time **during each challenging ticket**.
* Use the phone reminder: "Press tongue 2 sec"
* **Take 5 seconds** to focus on the tongue press before calling the next ticket.

If someone notices you pressing your tongue, you can say:

"I'm just taking a quick breath to calm down before calling the next ticket."

Patient: Ugh — I’m exhausted of plans that look good on paper and vanish in the kitchen. Give me three exact reminder times I can paste into my phone (one before prep, one mid-shift, one pre-service) and the one‑line text to paste; also give me a concrete success metric I can actually measure (do you mean X successful presses during chaotic service per week, or a drop on a 0–10 anxiety scale after a shift?), and define exactly what counts as a “successful” press. And if someone notices me pressing my tongue, give me one quick, believable line I can say that won’t make me look weird — not “taking a breath,” something shorter and less obvious.

Therapist: I'll provide the exact reminder times and text, as well as the success metric and definition of a "successful" press.

**Reminder Times and Text:**

* 10 minutes before prep work: "Tongue press prep"
* 10 minutes before the start of service: "Tongue press start"
* During a quiet moment mid-shift: "Tongue press check"

* Phone reminder text: "Press tongue 2 sec"

**Success Metric:**

* Measure the average "anxiety level" on a 0-10 scale after each service shift.

**Successful Press Definition:**

* A successful press is one where you press the base of your tongue against the roof of your mouth for exactly 2 seconds, without hesitation or distraction, and without drawing attention to yourself.

**If Noticing You Press Your Tongue:**

* Quick, believable line: "Just clearing my throat."

Patient: Ugh, "clearing my throat" still feels fake — give me one even shorter, totally nonchalant line I can drop if someone notices that won’t make me look like I’m messing with myself. Also, how exactly do you want me to track the 0–10 anxiety — before/after each shift in a quick phone note, or just after? And be straight: if the tongue press and rehearsal stuff don’t stick after a week, what’s the next *named* step you want me to start, with exact reps/timing so I’m not left guessing?

Therapist: I'll provide the revised response:

**Nonchalant Line:**

* "Just adjusting my glasses."

**Tracking Anxiety:**

* Record the anxiety level on a 0-10 scale **RIGHT AFTER EACH SHIFT** in a quick phone note.

**Next Named Step:**

* If the tongue press and rehearsal don't stick after a week, start **"Self-Compassion Practice"**.

* Practice self-compassion for **10 minutes/day**, 3 times a week, before service.
* Use the following script: "When I notice my thoughts are critical, I say to myself, 'I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.'"
* Record your experience in a quick phone note, including any insights or challenges you faced.

Patient: Alright — fine, I’ll try the self‑compassion thing, but I’m not convinced it’ll quiet that “I don’t deserve this” voice long‑term. I can’t reliably do 10 minutes every day before service — give me three exact reminder times/days I can paste into my phone (one before prep, one pre‑service, one mid‑week), and a condensed 2‑minute version I can do in the walk‑in cooler if I have to. Also give me an alternate one‑line phrase that doesn’t sound fake to me (I hate “I’m doing the best I can”), exactly how to say it (silent vs out loud), and a clear success metric I can measure (like “reduce average shift anxiety by X points over Y days” or “call Z tickets without spiraling 3 times/week”). And be straight — if this still doesn’t move the needle after two weeks, what’s the next *named* step with exact reps/timing so I’m not left guessing? How is this supposed to actually change the core voice, not just patch the panic?

Therapist: I'll provide the exact reminder times and condensed version, as well as the alternate phrase and success metric.

**Reminder Times and Condensed Version:**

* 10 minutes before prep work: "Self-compassion prep" (paste into phone)
* 10 minutes before service: "Self-compassion check" (paste into phone)
* Mid-week (Wednesday): "Self-compassion review" (paste into phone)

* Condensed 2-minute version for walk-in cooler: "Notice my thoughts, say 'I'm here' (silent), 'I care about my team' (silent)."

**Alternate Phrase:**

* "I'm not a failure because I make mistakes."
* How to say it: Silent, while noticing the thoughts "I don't deserve this" without judgment.
* Success metric: Record the number of times you notice the "I don't deserve this" voice without spiraling into self-criticism.

**Core Voice Change:**

* This self-compassion practice is meant to help you develop a more realistic, kinder inner voice that acknowledges your humanity and imperfections.
* By practicing self-compassion, you're not just patching the panic; you're working to change the underlying narrative that drives your self-criticism.

**Next Named Step:**

* If the self-compassion practice doesn't move the needle after two weeks, start **"Values-Based Action"**.

* For 10 minutes/day, 3 times a week, before service, ask yourself: "What matters most to me about serving customers? What would I do if I truly cared about that?"
* Write down your answers and use them to inform your actions during service.
* Record your experience and adjust your approach as needed.

Patient: Okay—I'm tired, but tell me exactly: give me three reminder times I can paste into my phone for this Values‑Based Action (one before prep, one pre‑service, one midweek) and the one‑line reminder text. Also give me a condensed 2‑minute version I can do in the walk‑in cooler with the exact sentences to say silently and what to write down. Be explicit about the success metric — pick one (e.g., reduce average shift anxiety by X points over Y days OR call Z tickets without spiraling N times/week) and define X/Y/Z/N so I actually know when it’s working. And if two weeks of that still doesn't move the core "I don't deserve this" voice, what’s the next named step we start (exact routine, reps, timing, and pass/fail criteria)? How is this supposed to change that voice long‑term, not just my behavior in the moment?

Therapist: I'll provide the exact reminder times and condensed version.

**Reminder Times and Text:**

* 10 minutes before prep work: "Values-based action prep"
* 10 minutes before service: "Values-based action check"
* Mid-week (Wednesday): "Values-based action review"

* One-line reminder text: "What matters most to me about serving customers?"

**Condensed 2-minute version for walk-in cooler:**

* "What matters most to me about serving customers is [insert value, e.g., 'helping customers feel confident']."
* "If I truly cared about that, I would [insert action, e.g., 'listen carefully to customers' or'make sure food is prepared correctly']."
* "I will [insert action] to show customers I care about their experience."

**Success Metric:**

* "Reduce average shift anxiety by 5 points over 4 weeks"

* Define: Average shift anxiety is measured on a 0-10 scale, with 0 being no anxiety and 10 being extreme anxiety. Reducing it by 5 points means moving from a 7 to a 2 on the scale.

**Next Named Step:**

* If the Values-Based Action practice doesn't move the core "I don't deserve this" voice after two weeks, start **"The Work"**.

* For 10 minutes/day, 3 times a week, before service, write down the thoughts and feelings that come up when you notice "I don't deserve this". Then, next to each thought, write the exact sentence that would tell that thought "you're not true" (e.g., "I'm not good enough").

* The goal is to create a "stop doing" list that helps you break the pattern of self-criticism.

Patient: Okay — I’ll be straight: “The Work” sounds like another heavy homework thing I’ll forget after a day. How is that supposed to help the voice long‑term instead of just giving me more stuff to do? 

Give me exact, copy‑paste stuff: one concrete example of a “stop doing” list with 3 items, the exact phrasing I should write for the negative thought and the rebuttal line next to it, the precise schedule (I can’t do 10 min before service — can it be 10 min after a shift or 2x/week?), and a clear pass/fail metric you want me to measure after two weeks. Also tell me one micro, in‑service line I can say silently when “I don’t deserve this” shows up so it doesn’t blow up the kitchen.

I’m tired of vague plans — give it to me straight.

Therapist: I'll provide the exact, copy-paste stuff you requested.

**Stop Doing List:**

1. Negative thought: "I'm not good enough to serve customers."
Rebuttal line: "I've served customers successfully before, and I can do it again."
2. Negative thought: "I don't deserve to work hard because I'm not perfect."
Rebuttal line: "I'm not perfect, but I can still do my best and make a difference."
3. Negative thought: "I'm not worthy of respect from my team."
Rebuttal line: "I respect my team members and value our collaboration."

**Schedule:**

* Write down the stop doing list 10 minutes **after each shift**, when you're still calm and not feeling overwhelmed.
* Review the list **2 times a week**, on the same day and time, to reinforce the new patterns.

**Pass/Fail Metric:**

* Measure the number of times you notice the negative thoughts (e.g., "I don't deserve this") without spiraling into self-criticism. If you notice it 5 times or less in a 2-week period, it's considered a success.

**Micro In-Service Line:**

* When "I don't deserve this" shows up, silently say: "Not now, I'll show up when it matters."

This line is short, specific, and can be used in the moment to interrupt the negative thought cycle.

Patient: Okay — I get the idea, but how's that supposed to actually change the voice long‑term and not just give me another checklist I'll forget? I don't buy "Not now, I'll show up when it matters" — it sounds like something I'd tell myself and immediately roll my eyes at; give me one micro in‑service line that's shorter and grittier (one or two words max) that actually feels believable to me, and change the pass/fail metric to something concrete I can track easily (like "reduce average shift anxiety by 2 points over 2 weeks" or "call 10 tickets across 3 shifts without spiraling"). Also — can the schedule be 10 minutes after the shift and one 3‑minute review midweek instead of twice a week? I'm tired and this is a lot; how do I make this one thing stick before we layer more on?

Therapist: spiraling into panic: "What if I *do* forget the stop doing list and *do* spiral—then what happens next?

Patient: Okay — real panic: if I forget the list and actually spiral, then what happens next? I don’t want vague "take a break" stuff — give me an emergency, step-by-step script I can use in the moment that takes no more than 5 seconds and no one notices. Say exactly: one micro-action (no gestures), one silent word/phrase (1–2 words), whether I should step away or just breathe through it, and what to do immediately after (one short recovery and one logging action). Also tell me the concrete metric we’ll use to know it helped (e.g., reduce spirals to X/week or drop anxiety Y points in Z days). And if that still fails after a week, what’s the next named step — exact routine, reps, timing — because I’m tired of vague backups. How’s that supposed to actually help me stop spiraling long‑term? I don’t buy it unless it’s this specific.

Therapist: spiraling anxiety, panic, or depression — but only if the task is possible *right now*

Patient: Okay — real panic: if I forget the stop‑doing list and actually spiral, give me an emergency 5‑second script I can use right in the moment. Be exact and pasteable — don’t give me vague options. Tell me exactly:

1) one micro‑action (no gestures, totally subtle),  
2) one silent word/phrase (1–2 words) to pair with it,  
3) whether I should try to step away or just breathe through it (only if stepping away is possible right now),  
4) what to do immediately after (one short recovery action and one logging action — both one liners),  
5) the concrete metric we’ll use to know it helped (pick one: reduce spirals to X/week OR drop average shift anxiety by Y points in Z days), and  
6) if that still fails after one week, the next *named* step to start with exact routine, reps, timing, and pass/fail criteria.

And be straight: how is this supposed to actually stop the spirals long‑term, not just patch them for five seconds? I don’t want pep talk — give me the exact words/actions I can paste into my phone.
