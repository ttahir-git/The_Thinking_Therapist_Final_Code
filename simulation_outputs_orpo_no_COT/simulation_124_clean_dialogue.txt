Patient: I'm a fifty-something chef who moved recently, and I've been using procrastination to numb this nagging depression. The minute I put something off my brain goes full fortune-teller — I see orders piling up, the kitchen blowing up, me getting fired, losing everything and ending up alone — and I get totally hooked on that horrible story. I try to joke and stay upbeat at work, but that disaster loop keeps pulling me away from actually doing anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing how that "fortune-teller" story shows up when you're feeling stuck, and how it pulls you away from taking action. When you said "that horrible story," what happened in your body right then – like a knot or a tightness – as if it's "you" that's getting pulled into that loop?

Patient: It’s like a tight band around my chest and this hollow drop in my stomach, and my hands go jittery — like they want to be doing something with knives just to stop thinking. My breathing gets shallow, my jaw clenches, and my brain latches onto that worst-case movie so hard I can’t move — I just sit and watch it play out. Then I start fiddling with anything — checking my phone, making coffee, doing a pointless prep — anything to avoid the feeling, because imagining anything else just feels fake.

Therapist: It sounds like that "tight band around your chest" and that hollow feeling are really connected to the story playing out in your mind. When you notice that tightness and that feeling, what happens if you could just "be" with it for a moment – not to change it, but just to notice it as it is – while you're still holding onto the thought of those orders and the kitchen blowing up?

Patient: I try to do that, but the tightness just locks down harder — like trying to stare down a storm. The more I "notice" it, the louder the movie gets: orders pile up, the head chef’s yelling, I get fired, lose the house, end up alone — and my hands go jittery so I bolt to my phone or start fiddling with something to escape. I get that you're asking me to stay, but honestly that feels like pouring gasoline on the fire; being with it just makes me spiral faster.

Therapist: It feels like you're right there with me – that noticing the tightness and trying to stay with it while the worst-case story keeps playing is like trying to put out a fire with a blowtorch. When you say it feels like pouring gasoline on the fire, what happens if you could just *stop* trying to hold onto that story for a moment – not to let it win, but just to see what would happen if you let your hands go jittery and your phone be there while it's still playing in the background?

Patient: I tried that once, but the second I unclench my grip the movie just roars louder — orders pile up, the head chef starts yelling, I get fired, lose the apartment, and I'm out on the street. My chest clamps down and my hands snap to my phone like a reflex, because any idea that something else could happen just feels fake and unreal. I can't really "let go" — it feels like doing that would make the whole disaster chain inevitable, and then I'm just stuck watching it happen.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught up in the idea that if you let go of your grip, the worst-case story is going to unfold anyway – and that makes it feel like you'd be trapped in that disaster chain. What if, instead of trying to "let go" of the story, you were to notice it as it is – the loud, jarring sound of "I'm going to fail" – while you're still holding onto the phone?

Patient: I tried that — let the phone sit there and just watched the storm — but it only gets louder. My chest locks, my hands twitch to grab the phone, and the whole worst-case movie of orders backing up and me getting fired plays like it's already happening. Letting the phone be feels like a flimsy leash; any thought that maybe it won't happen just sounds fake and makes me more furious with myself. Honestly, I'm getting overwhelmed — I feel like we're going in circles and I don't know how to quiet the movie without doing something that'll make it explode.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling stuck and overwhelmed – like you're running on a hamster wheel and getting nowhere. When you say letting the phone sit there feels like a "flimsy leash," what if, instead of trying to hold onto that leash, you could *stop* noticing it as a leash – not to make it disappear, but just to see what would happen if you didn't care about what happened to it while the movie is playing?

Patient: I can't do that — if I stop treating it like a leash the movie yells that orders pile up, the head chef screams, I get fired and lose everything, so my chest clamps and I snap to the phone. I tried "not caring" once and it just made the storm louder; any idea that it might not happen feels fake and actually makes me more frantic. I'm honestly overwhelmed and kind of stuck — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really caught up in the story right now, and trying to not care isn't working. When you say the movie yelling louder feels like your chest clamping down, what would it be like to notice that clamping down *while* the movie is playing – not to try to stop it, but just to see what happens when you're feeling that tightness alongside the thoughts?

Patient: When I try that it’s like my chest gets squeezed and the movie just cranks to full volume — like two radios blaring at once and both are yelling the worst. My hands start twitching, my breathing gets shallow, and somehow the worst-case scenes feel more real, not less. I’m honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and stick with one thing at a time?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling overwhelmed by the two loud radios playing at once. When you say that noticing the chest squeezing makes the movie feel more real, what happens if you were to *just notice* the chest squeezing – the feeling of it, the sensation of it – *right now* – without trying to stop it or make the movie quieter?

Patient: It feels like a clamp squeezing my ribs, my breath sho rtens and my heart starts hammering, and the movie immediately goes full blast — orders double, the head chef’s shouting, I get fired and I’m out on the street. Trying to “just notice” makes everything louder, not softer; any other outcome sounds fake and I snap to my phone or start fiddling to escape. I’m honestly getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and stick with one tiny thing?

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice just the chest squeezing, everything else gets louder. When you say trying to notice makes everything louder, what happens if you were to notice the chest squeezing while *you're* sitting with it – not trying to stop it, not trying to make the movie quieter – *just* noticing the squeezing of your ribs, the shortening of your breath, and the hammering of your heart – while you're still holding onto the phone?

Patient: When I try that my chest clamps so hard it’s like someone’s tightened a belt, my breath goes thin, and the movie just dials up — orders double, the head chef’s screaming, I get fired, lose the flat, end up alone. My hands twitch toward the phone like it’s magnetized and I start scrolling or sharpening a knife just to calm down. I’m honestly getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down and stick with one tiny thing at a time?

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice the chest squeezing, it feels like it's getting tighter and tighter. What if, instead of trying to notice the squeezing while still holding onto the phone, you were to *put the phone down* for just one tiny moment – just a tiny moment – and *sit* with the squeezing, the shortening breath, and the hammering heart, *while the phone is still there*?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's putting the phone down supposed to help? The last time I did that the movie just cranked up: orders doubled, the chef started screaming, I got fired, lost the flat — my hands still scrambled for the phone like it was magnetized. I'm honestly overwhelmed and stuck — can we slow down and stick with one tiny, concrete step?

Therapist: It sounds like putting the phone down didn't work for you, and that's okay. What if, instead of trying to notice the chest squeezing while holding onto the phone, we could try something even smaller? What if you could *just move your hand* – not to pick up the phone, not to do anything with it, just to move it *away* from you for just one second – while the movie is still playing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's moving my hand for one second supposed to help? My hand feels glued to the phone; the second I loosen my grip the movie cranks up — orders double, the chef screams, I get fired — and I scramble back to it. This is getting heavy; can we really keep it tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like your hand feels stuck, and even a small movement feels like it's not going to be enough. What if we tried something even smaller than moving your hand? What if we just *noticed* the feeling of your hand being glued to the phone – without trying to change it, without trying to move it – for just one tiny breath?

Patient: I don't really follow—how's noticing my stuck hand for one breath supposed to help? When I try stuff like that the movie just cranks up: orders pile up, the head chef's yelling, I get fired, lose the flat, and my hand snaps to the phone, so it feels pointless. This is getting kind of wearing—can we keep it really, really tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the feeling of your hand being stuck doesn't feel like it's helping. What if we tried to notice *just one thing* about that feeling – not to change it, not to fix it – just to notice what's right in front of you right now, right where your hand is on the phone?

Patient: Okay—my thumb's on the phone and it feels glued there; the second I even think about moving it the movie cranks up—orders double, the chef's screaming, I'm fired. I don't see how noticing one tiny thing would stop that, and it's wearing me out—can we really keep it tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the feeling of your thumb being glued to the phone doesn't seem to be helping. What if we tried to notice *what the phone feels like to touch* – not what's happening inside you, not what the story is – just what it feels like to touch the phone right now, right where your thumb is?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this helps — but... okay. My thumb's on the glass, it's smooth and a bit warm from my hand, a faint grimy smear at the edge from prep, nothing sharp, just flat and slippery. And as soon as I notice that the movie spikes — orders double, chef rips into me, I'm fired — and I feel like I need to grab it again; can we keep it tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensation of your thumb on the glass helped you stay with it for a moment. What if, instead of trying to change what happens when the movie spikes, you could notice *just one more thing* – like what your hand feels like when you try to grab the phone again, right after the story kicks in?

Patient: My hand jerks — fingers clamp like I'm snatching the phone back, sweaty and weak, and it makes me feel pathetic and ashamed. The movie instantly spikes: orders pile up, the chef's screaming, I'm fired and out on the street — and that shame just fuels the scramble to grab the phone. I don't see how noticing that helps; it just makes me feel worse and stuck — can we really keep this tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensation of your hand jerking didn't help. What if we tried to notice *not the shame* – just what it feels like to be with that shame right now, while your hand is still jerking and your mind is still trying to grab the phone?

Patient: Okay—when I try to sit with the shame it’s like a hot weight behind my sternum, my throat tightens and my face feels flushed. My hand still jerks for the phone and the movie screams orders piling up, the chef ripping me, me getting fired — it makes me feel pathetic, like I’m a fraud. I don’t see how noticing this helps and it’s wearing me out—can we really keep it tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame didn't feel like it was helping. What if, instead of trying to notice the shame, we tried to notice *that it's not the shame that's happening when your hand jerks and the movie spikes* – just the physical sensations that come with it, like the weight behind your sternum, the tightness in your throat, and the flush on your face?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's noticing that it's "just" sensations supposed to stop the movie? When I try it the chest crushes, my throat tightens, my face heats up, my hand jerks for the phone and the whole worst-case plays out — orders pile up, the chef screams, I'm fired, lose the flat. It just feels pointless and makes me more ashamed; can we really keep it tiny and slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sensations didn't help you stop the movie. What if, instead of trying to notice what's happening, you could try *just to let it be there* – not to change it, not to fix it, just to let the weight behind your sternum be there while you still have the thought "I'm going to fail" – and not try to stop your hand from jerking?

Patient: I don't really follow how "letting it be" is supposed to help — every time I try that the movie just explodes louder: orders pile up, the chef's screaming, I'm fired, lose the flat. My chest gets like a brick, my throat clamps, my hand jerks for the phone anyway, and sitting with it just feels like waving a flag that says "go ahead, it's happening." I'm worn thin and this feels pointless, so can we keep it tiny and slow — one tiny step I can actually try without the whole disaster chain kicking off?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "let it be" felt like making the movie worse. What if, instead of trying to control it, you could try just one tiny thing *with* the thought "I'm going to fail" – like noticing your hand moving to the phone while it's still there, not trying to stop it, just noticing it?

Patient: I... I can try to notice my hand moving to the phone while the thought "I'm going to fail" is there, but the moment I even think that the movie roars and my fingers clamp onto the screen and I feel pathetic. It feels pointless and makes the shame louder, but if we’re keeping it tiny I’ll try to let my thumb brush the edge without picking it up for one slow breath — though I don’t really expect it to quiet the disaster.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice your hand moving to the phone while holding the thought "I'm going to fail" still triggers the movie. What if, instead of trying to quiet the disaster, you could try to notice what happens *while* your thumb brushes the edge of the phone – not while you're trying to stop the movie, but just for that tiny moment of touching the glass?

Patient: When my thumb brushes the edge the movie spikes right away — orders pile up, the chef's screaming, my fingers clamp to the screen and I feel this hot shame like I'm worthless. In that tiny moment I notice the glass is cool, my thumb trembles, and the urge to snatch it is fierce, but it just makes the disaster feel more real, not less. I don't see how this helps, but I can try one slow breath while my thumb's there if we keep it really, really small.

Therapist: It sounds like brushing the edge of the phone still triggers the movie. What if, instead of trying to notice what happens while your thumb brushes the edge, you could try to notice the *coolness* of the glass right now – just the sensation of it, without trying to change it or stop the movie?

Patient: Okay—it's cool and smooth under my thumb, a little slick from my sweat, kind of indifferent. But the second I notice that the movie roars: orders pile up, the chef's screaming, I get fired, and my thumb clamps to the phone and I feel useless and ashamed; this is wearing me out—can we keep it really, really tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the coolness of the glass didn't help. What if, instead of trying to notice what happens when the movie roars, you could try to notice the sensation of your thumb clamping down on the phone *while* the movie is still playing – not to stop it, but just to notice what's happening in that tiny moment?

Patient: I don't really follow how that helps — when I notice my thumb clamping it feels hot and useless, my breath shortens and my fingers lock like I'm snatching it, and the movie immediately screams orders piling up, the chef ripping me, me getting fired and out on the street. Noticing just makes the shame louder and I feel more stuck; can we keep it really, really tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sensation of your thumb clamping down made the shame worse. What if, instead of noticing what happens when your thumb clamps down, you could try *noticing* the *space* between noticing your thumb clamping down and the movie roaring – the tiny moment right before the movie takes over?

Patient: I don't really get what you mean by a "space" — there hardly is one. If anything it's a blink, a brief hollow in my chest like a cold pause, and then the movie roars back and my hand slams the phone and I feel pathetic. If there's any gap I can't hold it — this is wearing me out, can we keep it tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the gap as a brief moment of emptiness, not a space where anything can happen. What if, instead of trying to notice that gap, you could try *to stay with* that feeling of emptiness right now – not to change it, not to fill it, just to be with it while the movie is still playing?

Patient: I don't really get how "staying with the emptiness" helps — when I try that hollow feels like the calm before the storm and then the movie roars: orders pile up, the chef's screaming, I get fired, lose the flat. My chest goes cold, my hand slams to the phone, and I feel useless and ashamed; any idea that something else could happen just sounds fake. I'm really worn thin—can we keep it tiny and slow, like one small breath I can actually try without the whole disaster chain kicking off?

Therapist: It sounds like staying with the emptiness feels like it's just a temporary calm before the storm. What if, instead of trying to notice the emptiness, you could try to notice what would happen if you *let go* of the thought "I need to stop this" for just one tiny breath – not to stop the movie, but to see what would happen if you just let the thought be there while you're still holding the phone?

Patient: I don't really follow how letting go of "I need to stop this" for one breath helps — the second I even loosen up the movie roars: orders pile up, the chef's yelling, I'm fired, lose the flat. My chest slams shut and my hand snaps to the phone like it's glued; this is wearing me out, so can we keep it tiny — one slow, small breath I can actually try without everything exploding?

Therapist: It sounds like letting go of the thought "I need to stop this" doesn't feel like it's helping. What if, instead of trying to notice what happens when you loosen up, you could try to notice what happens when you *don't* try to stop it – what if you just held the phone for one second longer, not to stop the movie, but just to see what's there while it's still playing?

Patient: I don't really see how that helps — the second I even hesitate the movie's already screaming: orders pile up, the head chef rips me, I'm fired and out on the street. My chest tightens, my hand jerks and I'm snatching the phone back before the second's up; I can try to hold it one breath, but I don't expect it to change anything and I'm already worn thin, so can we keep it really, really tiny?
