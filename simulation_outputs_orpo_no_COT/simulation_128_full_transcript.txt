--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — I don't know what matters to me beyond being a manager. My mind is like a fortune-telling machine that says if I try to change or even breathe differently it will definitely spiral: I'll pick the wrong thing, lose my job, family fights will explode, and I'll end up alone and ruined. I keep getting hooked on those disaster stories and I can't seem to stop them.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that when you try to move towards what matters to you, that fortune-telling machine kicks in. Would it be possible to notice that machine showing up when you're trying to imagine what matters to you—like, right now, as you're holding that thought "I don't know what matters to me beyond being a manager"?

Patient: I try, but as soon as I hold that thought the machine just fires up — like right now I can already see the chain: I poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I get pushed out, family blames me, and I'm alone and ruined. I can sort of tell it's happening, but I get sucked in so fast that "noticing" feels like it'll do nothing. Saying maybe other things could happen just sounds... unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that machine doesn't feel like a way to "fix" it—like you're worried it'll just lead to more spiraling. Can you hold that feeling of being pulled into the story ("I'm already seeing it all happening") for just a moment, without trying to stop it?

Patient: I'm trying, but the moment I try to hold it the machine just roars louder — the whole collapse plays out: pick the wrong thing, boss notices, I'm out, family blames me. My chest tightens and I feel like I'm being dragged through that future like a movie I can't pause. Honestly, holding it just makes it more real and it feels pointless, because I already know that's what's going to happen.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding the thought actually makes it feel more vivid and immediate. What if, instead of trying to stop it, you could just notice the sensation of your chest tightening, like it's a physical thing happening in your body—right now, while the story's playing out?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My chest feels squeezed, my breath's shallow, and there's a knot in my stomach. But even as I notice that, the machine's yelling the future — I see myself picking the wrong thing, my boss noticing, getting pushed out, family blaming me — and feeling the body just makes that movie louder. I don't see how this helps; it just feels like I'm being dragged through it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations didn't help with the story. Can you try this: while the machine is still playing out the future, what if you could, just for a tiny moment, take the weight of that story away from your chest? Not to stop the story, but just to make space for it to play out while you notice the knot in your stomach?

Patient: I tried that — I could, for one breath, imagine the story playing while my chest felt a bit lighter. But then the fortune-telling machine just screams the next scene: I pick the wrong thing, the boss notices, I'm pushed out, family blames me — and the looseness disappears; noticing the knot somehow makes the movie louder. Honestly, I'm getting overwhelmed by all this — can we slow down? It feels like we're racing through the future and I'm stuck in the collapse.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Let's slow down. What would it be like to sit with that knot in your stomach, not to try to make it go away, but just to notice it—right now—while we pause the story? Not with the intention of stopping the future, but just to be with what's happening in your body, while we talk.

Patient: I'll try. The knot's low in my stomach, my breath's shallow and my chest feels tight. But the moment I focus there the machine ramps up — I prod around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me — and paying attention just makes that movie louder. I don't know how to hold both; it feels like staring at a car wreck I'm making worse by watching, so I'm getting more overwhelmed — can we go even slower?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between noticing the knot and the story. Let's try something really small: what would it be like to notice the knot in your stomach while you're still sitting with the thought "I don't know what matters to me"? Not trying to stop the story, but just noticing the knot while the thought is still there.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to feel the knot in my stomach while holding the thought "I don't know what matters to me." The knot's tight and buzzing, my breath's shallow, and the movie spikes — I can already see myself picking the wrong thing, the boss noticing, getting pushed out, family blaming me — and paying attention to the knot somehow makes that chain feel louder and more real. I can hold both for a second, but then the story drags me under and I get overwhelmed; I don't know how to keep the knot company without the future taking over.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot is helping you feel more connected to the story. What if, instead of trying to keep the knot company without the story, you could try noticing what happens when the knot gets tight while the story is playing? Not to stop the story, but just to notice what happens in your body when the knot shows up while you're already seeing the future.

Patient: When the knot gets tight, my heart starts racing, my hands go cold, my vision narrows and the movie zooms in — I literally feel pulled forward into that future scene like I'm being dragged down a hallway. Noticing the knot somehow proves the story to me: the tighter it gets, the more convinced I am that I'll pick the wrong thing, my boss will notice, I'll be pushed out and blamed. I'm already getting swallowed by it and I don't know how to hold the body and the story at the same time — can we slow down more?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot is actually making the story feel more real and inevitable. Let's try something tiny: what would it be like to notice the knot while you're still holding the thought "I don't know what matters to me"—noticing it right now, while we're still talking—without trying to stop the story?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to notice the knot while holding "I don't know what matters to me." The knot's a tight buzzing ball, my breath's shallow, my chest's crushed…and immediately the machine screams the next scenes: I poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. I can hold that for a second but then it drags me under and I get overwhelmed—can we slow down more? Imagining anything else just doesn't feel realistic to me.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the knot is showing up really strongly when you try to hold the thought "I don't know what matters to me." Let's try something really small: what would it be like to notice just one sensation in your body right now, like the buzzing in your chest, while you're still holding the thought "I don't know what matters to me"—not trying to stop the story, just noticing that sensation?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing one sensation supposed to help? Okay, I'll try: the buzzing in my chest is sharp, like a hollow squeeze, and my breath's shallow. But as soon as I name it the machine fires up: I poke at what matters, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined — it drags me under. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Noticing one sensation might not seem like it helps, but what if it just allows you to stay with what's already happening, without trying to fix it? It's like holding a small space for the buzzing, even when the machine starts up.

Patient: I don't see how that helps — when I try to hold a small space the buzzing just gets louder and the machine starts narrating the collapse: I poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me. I can do it for one breath, but then it drags me under and I feel more overwhelmed, not calmer. Can we slow down more? I honestly don't know how to imagine a different outcome; it just feels... impossible.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold the buzzing, it's like the machine is showing up even louder. What if, instead of trying to hold the buzzing, you could just notice it while the machine is already playing? Not to stop the story, but just to notice what happens in your body when the buzzing is there, while the machine is already showing up.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Alright, I'll try: the buzzing in my chest is sharp and hollow, my breath's shallow, my hands go cold. But the moment I notice it the machine screams the next scenes—I'll poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined—and noticing the buzzing just makes that movie louder and more convincing. I get swallowed up fast; can we slow down? Imagining any other outcome still feels impossible.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the buzzing makes the story even more real for you. What if, while that's happening, you could make room for the thought "I don't know what matters to me" to stay with you, not even for a tiny moment? Not to stop the story, but just to notice that you're holding onto something else, even if it feels like "nothing" matters right now.

Patient: I'll try, but the second I try to hold "I don't know what matters to me" the machine fires up: I prod around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. That thought just turns into a hollow nothing and the movie drowns it out—I can't seem to keep that "nothing" company because the collapse takes over. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down more? It still feels impossible to imagine any other outcome.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the thought "I don't know what matters to me" is getting lost in the machine's story. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that thought, you could just notice what happens to your body when the machine starts up—when you start thinking "I'll pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my body supposed to help when the machine's already yelling the future? Okay, when it starts my chest clamps down, my breath gets tiny, my stomach knots, my hands go cold and my vision narrows, and the movie just zooms in: I poke at what matters, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. I'm getting swallowed by it—can we slow down? Imagining any other outcome still feels impossible to me.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing your body's physical sensations isn't helping you with the thought "I don't know what matters to me" either. What if, instead of trying to notice your body or hold onto that thought, we just paused the machine for one moment—just long enough to see what's happening in that moment when it starts yelling the future?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how do you even "pause" it? If I try to stop it there's a weird blank for a breath and then it screams the worst: I pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. Imagining a pause already feels impossible and makes me more anxious—can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: Let's try something different. What if, instead of trying to stop the machine or imagine a pause, we just noticed the feeling of the machine yelling the future right now—while it's still happening. Not trying to stop it, not trying to change it, just noticing that feeling.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how do I "just notice" it without doing something? Okay, I'll try: the yelling feels like a hot pressure behind my sternum, my breath gets tiny, my hands go cold, and the movie immediately plays — I poke at things, pick the wrong choice, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. Noticing it now just seems to crank the volume up; I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the feeling of the machine yelling the future actually makes it feel more intense for you. What if, instead of trying to notice it, we could just acknowledge it to yourself, right now—without trying to change it or stop it. Like, "This hot pressure behind my sternum is here, and my breath is tiny, and my hands are cold..." Just acknowledging it, without trying to make it go away.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just saying it supposed to help? Okay, I'll try: this hot pressure behind my sternum, my breath tiny, my hands cold and my stomach a knot. But even saying that makes the machine shout the next scenes louder—I can feel the collapse coming and I'm getting more overwhelmed, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even acknowledging the physical sensations is making the machine's story feel more real for you. What if, instead of trying to notice the sensations or the story, we just made room for you to feel whatever is already present, right now—like the hot pressure behind your sternum, the tiny breath, the cold hands, the knot in your stomach. Not trying to change it, not trying to stop it, just making space for it to be there.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just making space supposed to help? I'll try: the hot pressure's behind my sternum, my breath's tiny, my hands are cold and my stomach's a knot—but the moment I make room the machine just screams the next scenes louder: I pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like making room for your physical sensations isn't helping with the machine's story. What if, instead of trying to notice your body or make room for it, we focused on what you're already doing when the machine starts yelling the future? You mentioned earlier that when it starts, your chest clamps down, your breath gets tiny, your hands go cold, and your stomach knots. What would it be like to notice that your body is already doing those things, even though the machine is yelling the worst?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing that it's already doing those things supposed to help? Alright, I'll try: my chest's clamping, my breath's tiny, my hands are cold and my stomach's a knot— and the moment I notice that the machine just screams the collapse louder: I poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. Noticing that it's already happening just feels like proof the future's set, and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing your body's response to the machine's story isn't helping with the overwhelm. What if, instead of trying to notice what's happening, we looked at what's already true right now? Like, what's actually happening in this moment, without trying to change it or stop the story. Noticing just the fact that your chest is clamping down, or your breath is tiny, or your hands are cold... just the fact that those sensations are there, right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just naming facts supposed to help? Okay: my chest's clamped, my breath's tiny, my hands are cold, my stomach's a tight knot, my shoulders are tense. But the moment I notice that the machine starts yelling the collapse: I poke around, pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. I'm already getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? I honestly can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like naming facts isn't helping with the overwhelm. What if we looked at what's happening when you say "I honestly can't see any other outcome"? What's that like for you, right now?

Patient: When I say that it feels like I'm stating a fact — my chest clamps, my breath gets tiny, and my whole body leans forward into whatever the machine's yelling. The disaster chain lights up and feels inevitable; any other possibility just sounds naive or like denial. I get nauseous and paralyzed, like I'm glued to watching the collapse happen, and I don't know how to pull myself out — can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought "I honestly can't see any other outcome" is actually connected to your physical sensations. When you say it feels like a fact, your body is already leaning forward, your chest is clamping, and your breath is tiny. It's like your body is already moving towards that disaster chain, even when you're thinking about it. What would it be like to notice that movement, while still holding that thought "I honestly can't see any other outcome"?

Patient: When I try to notice that movement while holding "I honestly can't see any other outcome," it feels like my whole body leans forward into the collapse — chest clamps, shoulders hunch, breath gets tiny, my vision narrows — and the movie becomes immediate: I pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me. Noticing it just feels like I'm proving the future is happening, like I'm fueling the machine instead of stepping back. I don't see how this helps; can we slow down? I feel overwhelmed and stuck.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that movement is actually making things feel more intense for you. When you say it feels like you're fueling the machine, it sounds like that's exactly what matters to you right now. What if, instead of trying to stop the machine or notice what's happening, you could just hold onto that feeling of overwhelm and stuckness for one moment?

Patient: I can try, but when I try to hold the overwhelm the machine just screams louder—my chest crushes, my breath vanishes, and I can already see the whole collapse: I pick the wrong thing, my boss notices, I'm pushed out, my family blames me. It feels like holding it just fuels the story instead of helping, and I'm getting panicked; can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this without being dragged into that future.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding onto the overwhelm is actually making things feel worse, not better. When you say it feels like fueling the story, that's exactly what matters to you right now. What if, instead of trying to hold onto it, you could just ask yourself one tiny question: "What matters most to me right now, about staying with this feeling?"

Patient: What matters most right now is not missing the warning signs — I feel like if I don't stay with this feeling I'll be blindsided and make the wrong move that starts the whole collapse. Staying here feels like the only way to protect myself, even though it makes my chest clamp and the movie louder. I'm kind of confused about whether that actually helps, and I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like staying with the feeling is actually what matters most to you, even if it feels like it's making things worse. When you say it feels like protecting yourself, that's a really clear intention. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that feeling, you could just notice what it feels like to *not* protect yourself—what would that be like for you, right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is imagining "not protecting" supposed to help? If I try to picture it it feels like stepping off a cliff: my chest slams shut, breath disappears, hands go cold, and the machine immediately narrates the aftermath — I let my guard down, make the wrong move, my boss notices, I'm out, my family blames me and I'm ruined. I'm getting really overwhelmed just thinking about that; can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like imagining not protecting yourself is actually making things feel worse, not better. When you say it feels like stepping off a cliff, that's a really vivid and intense image. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that image, you could just notice what's happening in your body when you think about not protecting yourself—what sensations show up, like your chest slamming shut or your breath disappearing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's noticing supposed to help? But okay: when I think about not protecting myself my chest slams shut, my breath vanishes, my hands go ice-cold, my stomach knots and my vision narrows like I'm being pulled into that future. The moment I notice it the fortune-telling machine screams the collapse louder, and I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down?
