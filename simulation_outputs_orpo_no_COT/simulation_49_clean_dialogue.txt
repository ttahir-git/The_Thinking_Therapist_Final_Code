Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop where I keep seeking reassurance to numb the panic I get around social stuff. I'm an artist in my late twenties starting a demanding new program and it makes me message people, over-explain, and check for approval nonstop. I don't really see how talking will fix that — I've tried things before, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it be like if, for just 10 seconds, you let that panic show up while you're messaging someone without needing to "fix" it? Not because you're trying to change it, but because it might give you a tiny glimpse into what matters to you about connecting with others.

Patient: Okay, that sounds... really uncomfortable — I can already feel the spike and the urge to delete the message. How is that supposed to help? I've tried being more honest before and it just made me feel exposed or like people pulled away, but maybe I could try it for 10 seconds now, though I doubt I won't start asking for reassurance halfway through.

Therapist: Noticing that "doubt" feels like a familiar companion when you think about trying this. What matters to you about staying in that 10-second moment, even if you don't think you can pull it off, when it might mean showing up more authentically with that artist friend?

Patient: I guess what matters is that I want to be seen for who I actually am, not this over-explaining, polished version that’s always fishing for approval. Maybe those 10 seconds could show me I can tolerate the awkwardness and still connect, or that people don’t vanish the second I stop performing. But honestly, I can already feel the urge to panic and message again asking if I said the right thing — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Noticing that "the urge to panic" shows up even when you're trying to connect with what matters to you. Can you be kind to that urge, even if it still wants to send you that "you're not good enough" message?

Patient: I mean, I can try to be kind to it, but it feels weird and kind of fake—like I'm talking to a neighbor instead of the thing that's making me want to delete the message. Saying "it's okay" in my head usually just makes the panic louder and I still want to ask for reassurance. How is that supposed to help? Maybe I could try one tiny line—like "I notice you're scared"—for ten seconds and see if I don't immediately text, but I'm not promising much.

Therapist: Noticing that even the thought of being kind feels like it's trying to calm down the panic – like you're trying to soothe the storm while it's still raging. What happens if you could just let the "I'm scared" thought show up, without trying to fix it or make it go away?

Patient: If I just let "I'm scared" sit there... my chest tightens, my stomach flips, and my fingers are already moving toward my phone. It feels like leaving a wound open—like I'm inviting judgment or abandonment. How is that supposed to help? Still, I guess I could try holding it for ten seconds to see if it fades or if I actually survive, but I'm not promising I won't cave.

Therapist: Noticing that holding it for 10 seconds feels like a small act of courage, even if it doesn't feel like it's changing the pain. What would it be like to hold it for 10 seconds while you're still sitting there, with your fingers hovering over the phone, and then move your hand to hold your coffee or something else – just one small step – while the thought of "I'm scared" still shows up?

Patient: I can picture it — ten seconds already feels huge: my chest tightens and my thumb's twitching, but moving my hand to a warm cup might actually slow that impulse. I'll try it, though I bet I'll still want to send a follow-up asking if I sounded okay. How is that supposed to help when the urge's already screaming at me — do you want me to try it now?

Therapist: Noticing that you're already wondering how to handle the follow-up question while holding the cup – like you're trying to keep two things going at once. What if, for just a moment, you let go of the idea that you need to "fix" that follow-up question while holding the cup? Could you just hold the cup, and notice what happens when that follow-up thought shows up, without trying to chase it away?

Patient: Okay, I'll try holding the cup and just notice the follow-up thought, but my brain's already drafting the extra message and itching to hit send. I can imagine the warmth grounding me a bit and maybe making the urge quieter, but I still expect to start typing a "did that make sense?" text halfway through. How is that supposed to help if I just watch it and don't fix it—won't the anxiety just keep nagging until I give in?

Therapist: Noticing that even imagining fixing the follow-up question is making it feel like you need to control the anxiety – like it's still a puzzle to be solved. What if, for just a moment, you let the anxiety show up without trying to solve it, and instead, focused on what matters to you about staying connected with your friend – not what's driving the anxiety?

Patient: What matters is actually being seen—showing up as me, not this performative version that's always fishing for approval. Maybe focusing on connection instead of the panic could make me less likely to send the follow-up, but how is that supposed to help when my chest's already racing and my brain's yelling I'll be judged? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: Noticing that your chest is still racing, and your brain is still saying you'll be judged – like those feelings are already happening, even when you're trying to focus on what matters. What if, instead of trying to calm the panic, you could notice it showing up for you, without trying to change it? Could you see that "I'm racing" isn't about being in the wrong, but about being scared – scared of not being good enough, scared of being seen?

Patient: Yeah, I can see that—maybe my racing heart is just fear of being seen or not being good enough. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried "just notice it" before and it doesn't stop me from drafting the extra message or hitting send; right now my chest's tight and I'm feeling really exposed. I can try to notice it for ten seconds, but I'm already overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe talk through exactly what I'm supposed to do when the urge to fix it spikes?

Therapist: Noticing that you're already feeling overwhelmed, and that noticing the fear isn't fixing it – it's just making it worse. What if, instead of trying to notice it for ten seconds, we looked at what happens when the urge to fix it spikes? What would it be like to have that thought, "I need to fix it," while you're actually holding the cup, and making space for your friend's question?

Patient: It'd feel split in two — one part drafting a follow-up on autopilot while the other clutches the cup and tries not to move. My chest tightens, my thumb twitches, and the thought "I need to fix it" gets so loud it drowns everything else. Maybe letting the friend's question have space could slow the urge, but how is that supposed to help when the spike is screaming at me to send the message? I'm already overwhelmed — can we slow down and go through exactly what I'm supposed to do when that urge hits?

Therapist: Noticing that the urge to fix it feels like it's taking over, and that letting the friend's question have space is still a small step – but what if that small step actually helped. What if, when the urge to fix it spikes, you could just notice it showing up, and then say to yourself, "I see that I want to fix it. But what matters most to me right now is connecting with my friend."

Patient: I can try saying that — "I see that I want to fix it. But what matters most is connecting" — but my chest's already tight and my thumb's twitching, so I bet it'll feel like lip service. How is that supposed to help when the panic's screaming at me to send the follow-up? Can we slow down and you tell me exactly how to practice that in the moment so it isn't just words?

Therapist: Noticing that saying it feels like lip service, and that's making it harder to take action. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the words, we focused on what would happen if you *could* say that phrase, even if your chest was tight and your thumb was twitching?

Patient: If I actually said, "I see that I want to fix it… but connecting is more important," maybe it'd create a tiny gap — my thumb might stop mid-twitch and I'd actually read the friend's message instead of reflexively replying. It could make the urge less urgent so I wait a beat and notice how my friend responds, not just my panic. But honestly, how is that supposed to help in real time? Can you walk me through the exact steps to practice that in the moment so it's not just lip service?

Therapist: Noticing that you want to know exactly how to do it in real time. Here's what I'd like you to try: 

When the urge to fix it spikes, notice the physical sensations first – the tightness in your chest, the twitching in your thumb. Take one tiny step with your hand – just move it to the cup for a second, without thinking about fixing the message. 

As you're holding the cup, notice what happens with the urge to fix it. Is it still there, or is there a tiny bit of space between it and what you're doing? 

Now, when you're ready, say to yourself, "I see that I want to fix it... but connecting is more important." Not because you're trying to be calm or perfect, but because that's what matters most to you in this moment.

Patient: Okay, I tried it — felt my chest clamp up and my thumb twitch, moving my hand to the cup actually made the twitch ease a little and I could read the message instead of auto-drafting a follow-up. There was a tiny gap where the urge got quieter, but it felt fragile, like I was just postponing the panic, not changing it. How is that supposed to help long-term when the urge just comes back louder later? I’m already overwhelmed — can we slow down and practice what to do if the urge spikes so I don’t just bail or send that extra message?

Therapist: Noticing that the gap felt fragile, and that the urge still came back louder later. That's a natural response – it's like your nervous system is saying, "Okay, I thought I fixed it, but nope, it's still here."

Let's try something new. When the urge spikes again (and it will), notice what happens in your body – the tightness, the twitching, the feeling of "I need to fix it." 

Instead of trying to "fix" it, notice what matters most to you right now. What would it mean to you to connect with your friend, even if your nervous system is screaming at you to send that extra message? 

Now, here's the thing: when you notice that "I need to fix it" thought, what if you could say to yourself, "I'm not sure how to fix it right now, but I know what matters most to me." That's not about being calm or perfect; it's about showing up for what matters to you, even when your nervous system is trying to push you away.

Patient: Okay, I tried that line in my head before and it made a tiny gap, but last time the panic just came back louder and I ended up messaging anyway — so how is that supposed to help long-term? Can we slow down and actually roleplay it step-by-step? Tell me exactly what to say in the moment instead of a follow-up, what to do if I’ve already hit send, and what to do when my thumb’s twitching and the urge is screaming — I’m feeling overwhelmed and need concrete, real-time instructions.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you through a roleplay. Remember, this is just a simulation, and you're not actually sending a message. 

Let's say you're about to hit send, and the urge to fix it is really strong. As you place your finger on the screen, notice what's happening in your body. Where does the urge feel in your chest? In your stomach? 

Now, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, say to yourself, "I'm not sure how to fix it right now." 

As you say those words, notice what happens with the urge. Is it still there, or is there a tiny bit of space between it and what you're doing? 

Here's what you can do next: If the urge is still there, and you feel like hitting send, *pause for just 1 second*. That's it. Just 1 second. 

What matters most to you in this moment is connecting with your friend. What would it mean to you to show up for that connection, even if your nervous system is trying to push you away?

Patient: It would mean being seen as me, not this performative version, and maybe not losing people just because I don't polish everything — that actually matters. I'm feeling overwhelmed right now — chest's tight, thumb's twitching — and I'm already asking, how is that supposed to help? Can we slow down and actually roleplay the exact words to say instead of a follow-up, plus step-by-step what to do if I've already hit send or the urge spikes?

Therapist: Noticing that the thought "how is this supposed to help?" is still there, even as you're holding onto what matters to you. 

Let's focus on what you can say to yourself right now, when you feel that tightness in your chest and your thumb twitching. 

Instead of "I need to fix it," what if you said to yourself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, but what matters most to me is showing up for this connection." 

Notice how that feels in your body. Is it still tight, or is there a tiny bit of space? 

Now, let's imagine that you're about to hit send on that message. As your finger is about to press the screen, take a deep breath in, and say to yourself, "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now, but what matters most to me is showing up for this connection."

What would you do next, if you'd already sent the message and the urge spiked again?

Patient: If I'd already sent it and the urge spikes again, I'd probably freeze and start drafting a follow-up on autopilot. In the moment I'd try this, step-by-step: 1) Pause and take three slow breaths. 2) Say out loud or in my head one short script — either "I see I'm anxious right now" or "I'm feeling overwhelmed, but connecting is more important." 3) Move my hand away from the phone (pick up my cup or a grounding object) and do a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, etc.). 4) If I still want to send something, write the follow-up in Notes instead of the chat and set a 10–30 minute rule before revisiting it.  

I know that sounds like a lot of rules — I've tried timers and scripts and they don't always work, so how is this supposed to help long-term? I'm already feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and actually roleplay me saying that script while you push back like a friend so I can practice it in real time?

Therapist: Noticing that you're already feeling overwhelmed, and that trying new strategies feels like a lot of rules. 

Let's focus on what matters most to you – connecting with your friend – and what's holding you back from showing up fully. 

When you say to yourself, "I see I'm anxious right now," what does that feeling of anxiety feel like in your body? Is it a knot in your stomach, a tightness in your chest, or something else? 

Let's try to say that script in a real way – not just as a thought, but as a physical feeling that shows up in your body. As you say it out loud or to yourself, "I see I'm anxious right now," notice what happens with that feeling. Does it start to make sense to you – like you're not just anxious, but you're also scared of missing this connection?

Patient: I said it out loud — “I see I’m anxious right now” — and my voice was shaky. My chest loosened a tiny bit and the knot in my stomach felt more like “this is fear” than “I’m broken,” but the panic’s still there and my thumb’s twitching. How is that supposed to stop me from replying? Can we slow down and actually roleplay it with you pushing back like a friend so I can practice saying it when I’m about to hit send?

Therapist: Noticing that your voice was shaky, and that the chest loosening was a small step forward. 

When you said, "I see I'm anxious right now," what did it feel like to connect with that fear – like you're not just anxious, but you're also scared of missing this connection? 

Now, let's imagine that you're about to hit send, and your friend is waiting for your response. You're about to reply, but you're still feeling that panic – what matters most to you in this moment?

Patient: What matters most is being seen as the real me — not this performative, over-explaining version that's always fishing for approval. Right now I want to actually connect and not lose the person, but my chest's tight, my thumb's twitching, and the panic's yelling to fix it. How is that supposed to help when the urge feels way bigger than what I say I want? Can we roleplay it now — you push back like a friend so I can practice saying the line in the moment?

Therapist: Noticing that your chest is still tight, your thumb's still twitching, and the panic's still yelling – but what matters most to you is being seen as the real you. 

Let's imagine that your friend is waiting for your response, and you're about to reply. As you're about to hit send, I'm going to say something that might make it harder for you to say what you want – "But what if they think you're not good enough? What if they don't like you for who you are?" 

What would you say to that – what would it be like to push back against that fear, and still connect with your friend?

Patient: I'd probably say something like, "Okay, I hear you — you might judge me, and that would hurt. Maybe they'll like me, maybe they won't, but I want to try being real anyway." But honestly that sounds cheesy when my thumb's twitching — how is that supposed to help when it feels like lip service?

I'm already feeling kind of overwhelmed just saying it out loud — can we actually roleplay it now with you pushing back like before so I can practice saying that while my chest's tight?

Therapist: Noticing that saying it out loud feels like lip service – and that's okay. 

Let's try it again, with me pushing back like a friend. You're about to hit send, and your friend is waiting for your response. As you're about to reply, I'm going to say something that might make it harder for you to say what you want – "But what if you fail? What if you say something stupid and they laugh at you?" 

What would you say to that – what would it be like to push back against that fear, and still connect with your friend?

Patient: I'd probably say, "Yeah, maybe I'll say something dumb — that would suck — but I don't want to keep performing. I'd rather risk being real." But my chest's already tight and my thumb's twitching, so saying that feels thin, like lip service. How is that supposed to help when I'm already panicking — can we slow down and actually roleplay it now with you pushing back so I can practice saying it while my body's freaking out?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you said what mattered most to you – "I'd rather risk being real" – your body is still reacting. 

Let's try it again, with me pushing back like a friend, while you're already feeling tight. You're about to hit send, and your friend is waiting for your response. As you're about to reply, I'm going to say something that might make it harder for you to say what you want – "But what if they leave you? What if this conversation doesn't even matter?" 

This time, I want you to notice where your chest is feeling tight, and what's making your thumb twitch. Not to stop it, but to see what's happening right there.

Patient: My chest feels like it's being squeezed and my thumb's jittering — like the panic's trying to force me to fix it right now. If they leave, yeah, that would suck and it would feel like the fear was right, but I don't want to keep hiding who I am just to avoid that hurt; I'd rather risk being real. How is that supposed to help when I'm already panicking? Can we slow down and actually roleplay it now, with you pushing back while I try to say it?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you said what mattered most to you – "I'd rather risk being real" – your chest is still squeezing and your thumb is still jittering. 

Let's try it again, with me pushing back like a friend, while you're already feeling tight. You're about to hit send, and your friend is waiting for your response. As you're about to reply, I'm going to say something that might make it harder for you to say what you want – "What if you say something stupid, and they laugh at you? What if you're not good enough?" 

This time, I want you to notice the physical sensation of your chest squeezing, and what happens when your thumb starts to jitter. What would it be like to pause for just one breath, and say "I see that my body is trying to protect me... but I want to connect with what matters most to me."

Patient: Okay — I paused, took one breath, and said, "I see that my body is trying to protect me... but I want to connect with what matters most to me." My chest loosened a hair and there was a tiny gap, but my thumb's still jittering and it felt really fragile. How is that supposed to help long-term when that gap can vanish in a second? Can we slow down and actually roleplay it now — you push back like before while I try the line, and tell me exactly what to do if the space collapses and I hit send anyway?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you paused and said what mattered most to you – "I want to connect with what matters most to me" – your thumb is still jittering and the space feels fragile. 

Let's try it again, with me pushing back like a friend, while you're already feeling tight. You're about to hit send, and your friend is waiting for your response. As you're about to reply, I'm going to say something that might make it harder for you to say what you want – "What if you're not good enough? What if they don't like you?" 

This time, I want you to notice the physical sensation of your chest squeezing, and what happens when your thumb starts to jitter. When that space collapses, and you hit send anyway – I want you to notice what happens *right after* that. Not the feeling of the message being sent, but what happens to your body and mind *in the next 30 seconds*. What would it be like to hold onto that small gap, even for just 10 seconds, and see what matters most to you in that moment?

Patient: Right after I hit send, there's this weird drop—like a split-second relief, then my chest tightens and my stomach knots up again, and my brain starts drafting a follow-up before I even look. I start scanning the phone like, "Did they like it? Did I sound dumb?" and that nagging urge to fix it comes back loud. If I could hold that tiny gap for 10 seconds, maybe I'd notice that what I care about is being seen, not perfection, but honestly—how is that supposed to help when the urge screams so fast? I'm already overwhelmed—can we slow down and actually roleplay what I do in those 30 seconds after I hit send so I don't just reflexively mess it up?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you hold onto that tiny gap for 10 seconds, the urge to fix it still comes back – but this time, it's more intense. 

Let's try to focus on what happens in those 30 seconds after you hit send. When that urge to fix it comes back, and you start scanning the phone, what's the first thing you notice about your body? Where does the urge to fix it feel in your chest, stomach, or head? 

As you notice that feeling, I want you to try something small – just for 1 second – while you're still holding onto that tiny gap. What if you said to yourself, "I see that I'm already worried about how this might go... but what matters most to me is being seen as the real me"? Not "I'm worried I'll mess it up" – but "I care about being seen".

Patient: I tried it — “I see that I’m already worried… but I care about being seen” — and my chest tightened then sort of eased for a breath, like a tiny hiccup of calm. That one second made a small gap where I wasn’t drafting a follow-up, but it felt fragile and my thumb started twitching again almost immediately. How is that supposed to help when the urge comes back so fast and loud? I’m feeling overwhelmed right now — can we slow down and actually roleplay those 30 seconds after I hit send so I can practice what to do when the space collapses?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you said what mattered most to you – "I care about being seen" – the urge to fix it still came back quickly. 

Let's try to focus on what happens in those 30 seconds after you hit send. When the urge to fix it comes back, and your thumb starts twitching again, what's the first thing you notice about your body? Where does that urge to fix it feel in your chest, stomach, or head? 

This time, I want you to notice what happens when you say to yourself, "I see that I'm already worried... but I care about being seen" – what happens to that tiny gap between the worry and the care. Not the gap itself, but what it's like to *be* in that gap for a moment. 

As you notice that tiny moment, I want you to try something small – just for 1 second – while you're still holding onto that gap. What if you did *one tiny thing* that matters to you, not because it fixes the worry, but because it connects you to what you care about?

Patient: I guess one tiny thing I could do is make one quick mark in my sketchbook — like a 5‑second doodle — just to remind myself I'm someone who creates, not just someone who panics. When I picture doing that my chest loosens a bit but the urge to text is still loud, so how is that supposed to help long-term? I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and actually roleplay me doing that while you push back so I can practice holding the gap?

Therapist: Noticing that even when you do that tiny mark in your sketchbook, the urge to text is still loud. 

Let's try to focus on what happens in those 30 seconds after you hit send. When you're already typing away, and your chest is still tight, what if you could notice that tiny mark in your sketchbook *right there*, while you're still typing? 

Not as a distraction, but as a reminder – what if that mark shows up *while* you're connecting with what matters to you? What if that tiny act of creation matters just as much as that message, even if it feels small?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try picturing making one quick mark in my sketchbook — I imagine my hand moving, one messy stroke, and my chest loosens a hair like there’s a tiny pocket of space. But the urge to text is still screaming and my thumb’s twitching, so how is that supposed to help long-term? I’m feeling overwhelmed — can we slow down and actually roleplay this now, with you pushing back like a friend while I try the mark and say the line, and tell me exactly what to do if the space collapses and I hit send?
