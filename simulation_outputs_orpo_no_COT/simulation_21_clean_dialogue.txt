Patient: I'm a senior who's back in school, but lately I feel stuck and directionless — like being a student is the only thing that defines me and I don't know what matters beyond that. A recent health scare made it worse; I'm more anxious and full of self-doubt than I expected. Honestly, I've tried talking about this before, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight right now. When you say "this is supposed to help," it feels like you're already wondering if it will be enough. Can you tell me what matters most to you when it comes to feeling stuck and anxious – not just about being a student, but about what matters in your life?

Patient: I guess what matters is not being only a student — I want some sense of creativity, small close relationships, and feeling like my life has meaning beyond classes. The health scare made me want that more but also left me scared and stuck, like I can't picture a future that isn't just school. I've done values stuff before, so... how is talking about this supposed to actually help when I can't even see past the next exam?

Therapist: It feels like trying to make sense of your future when the next exam is looming is really hard. When you think about what matters most to you – creativity, close relationships, meaning – what happens in your body when you try to imagine having some of that in your life?

Patient: I get this tight, heavy feeling in my chest and my stomach drops, like there's a knot that won't go away. My breathing gets shallow and my hands go a bit clammy, and sometimes I just go kind of numb — like I'm watching everything from the outside. But... how is noticing that supposed to help? Naming it doesn't make the exam or the future any less scary.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "make room" for that feeling or imagining a future might be a bit like trying to push the knot away – and that can make it even harder. What if, instead, you could notice that knot just as you're sitting here, looking at the exam – not because you're trying to push it away, but just because it's there?

Patient: I can try to notice it — when I do the knot feels louder, like my mind starts racing about everything I haven't done. But honestly, sitting with it just makes me spin into panic or numbness, so how is that supposed to help? I've tried mindfulness and breathing before and it just felt like band-aids; I need something that actually changes how I move forward, not just names the feeling. What would actually come next if I did notice it instead of pushing it away?

Therapist: It sounds like the knot feels like a doorway to your mind, and when you try to push it away, you feel like you're losing control. What if, instead of trying to stop the knot from showing up, you could just notice it for a second – without trying to push it or make it go away?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it for a second, but when I do it usually gets louder and I start spiraling. How is noticing it going to help me actually get work done or picture a future—won't it just freeze me more? If I notice it, then what? What's the next step besides naming the knot?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot might feel like you're taking a step backward. What if, instead of trying to stop the knot or make it smaller, you could notice it for a second and then *ask yourself* what matters most to you right now – not about fixing the knot, but about what matters in your life?

Patient: Okay, I notice the knot — it gets louder but I’ll try. What matters most right now is not just passing classes but having a few close people who see me, doing small creative things so I don’t feel like a walking syllabus, and being able to imagine any future that isn’t just exams. But seriously — how is naming that supposed to stop me from freezing up when panic hits? I've tried figuring out priorities before and it didn't change the panic.

Therapist: It sounds like naming your values didn't change the feeling of being frozen up. What if, instead of trying to stop the panic, you could *move towards* what matters most – even if it's just for a tiny step?

Patient: Fine — I can hear you, and maybe a tiny step could be opening my sketchbook for five minutes or texting one person that I trust. But when panic hits I can barely breathe, let alone do that, so how is taking a tiny step any different from everything I've tried that didn't work? I don't know, it's just... I want it to help, but I'm skeptical it'll get me past the freeze.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to figure out what matters most – not just in theory, but in a way that feels connected to your actual experience with panic. What would it be like to *try* opening that sketchbook or texting that person *while* feeling the panic – not as a way to fix it, but as a way to make room for it?

Patient: If I tried that while panicking, I'd probably fumble, stare at the sketchbook or the text box, and feel guilty for not being able to calm down first — my hands would shake and I'd bail. Maybe doing it anyway could feel like a tiny proof that panic doesn't have the final say, but it also might just remind me how out of control I feel. Honestly, I've tried leaning into things before — how is doing a tiny action while panicking actually supposed to change the freeze?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already aware of the pattern of fumbling and feeling guilty – and that's a really hard thing to lean into. What if, instead of trying to make the panic go away or feeling like you need to control it, you could *be with* the feeling of being out of control – not as something to fix, but as something that's already there?

Patient: I can try to be with the feeling, but honestly when I do it usually swells and I spiral — my chest tightens and I go numb. How is "being with it" supposed to actually help me open my sketchbook or text someone instead of just letting the panic win? If I try this, what’s the concrete next step after noticing it so I don't just freeze?

Therapist: It sounds like being with the feeling is hard to sustain. What if, instead of trying to sustain it, you could *notice it for a second* – just a tiny second – before you try to open the sketchbook or text someone?

Patient: Okay, I can try noticing it for a second before I try the sketchbook or texting — but how is that supposed to help when that second is exactly when the panic spikes? Usually the knot gets louder and I bail, then beat myself up for failing. If we're doing this, what’s the concrete next move in that second — a sentence to say to myself, two breaths, or a tiny physical action — so it doesn't just turn into another thing I fail at?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the cycle of failing and beating yourself up. What if, when the knot gets louder, the next thing you do isn't to try to control it or push it away – but to *just notice the word "open" when it comes to your sketchbook, without doing it yet*?

Patient: I can try noticing the word "open," but when I do my chest tightens and I bail — so how is that supposed to help? Do you mean say it out loud, think it, or just notice it like a label? And if I notice "open" and the panic spikes, what's the exact tiny next move — move my hand a bit, flip one page, or two breaths — because otherwise I'll just freeze and then feel guilty.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already close to what might help. What if, when you notice the word "open," instead of trying to control it or push it away, you *let it be there for just a second* – without changing it, and without trying to make it happen – and then *move your hand one tiny inch* toward the sketchbook?

Patient: Okay... I can try noticing "open" for a second and then move my hand one inch toward the sketchbook. Even that feels huge — my chest tightens just imagining it and I’m already bracing for freezing and beating myself up. How is a one-inch movement actually supposed to change the panic when I almost never follow through?

Therapist: It sounds like the "one-inch movement" feels like a huge ask when the panic is already there. What if, instead of trying to make the movement happen, you could *just notice that you're bracing for freezing* – without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice that I'm bracing — my shoulders tighten, breath gets shallow, my hands go cold, like I'm waiting to shut down. But I'm skeptical — noticing hasn't stopped the panic before, it just leads to more guilt when I bail. If I do notice it, what exactly comes next that actually makes me move my hand that one inch instead of freezing?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing isn't enough to change the pattern. What if, when you notice the bracing, *you say to yourself "I'm here with this feeling"* – not to change it, but just to be with it, and then *you notice what it would take to make that one-inch movement toward the sketchbook* – not as a way to make the panic go away, but as a way to show up with your body and your breath?

Patient: Okay... I can try saying "I'm here with this feeling" — feels kind of small but maybe doable. Maybe what would help the one-inch is giving myself permission to be painfully slow: rest my fingertips on the sketchbook edge, take one long slow exhale, and tell myself "that's enough for now" so I don't beat myself up if I stop. But honestly — how is that supposed to get me past the freeze when the panic just swallows me and I can't even move my hand?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to make the small step manageable, but the panic is still so overwhelming. What if, instead of trying to push through the panic, you could *meet it with kindness* – not to make it go away, but to see what happens if you did give yourself permission to be "painfully slow" *right in the middle of the panic*?

Patient: Maybe... I could try saying something like "I'm here, this is hard" and just rest my fingertips on the sketchbook edge while breathing out slowly. But honestly, kindness usually just sits there and then guilt shows up later — how is that actually supposed to get me to move that inch instead of freezing? If I try it, what tiny, concrete cue should I use in the moment so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like kindness is still getting pushed away by guilt. What if, when you say "I'm here, this is hard," you *use that sentence as a cue to notice what your hand is doing* – not to try to change it, but to see what happens when you notice the tiny movement of your hand, even if it's just resting on the edge of the book?

Patient: Okay... I can try using "I'm here, this is hard" as the cue and just rest my fingertips on the sketchbook edge to notice the tiny movement. But when I do that my hand usually goes numb and I freeze and then beat myself up — how is noticing that supposed to actually get me to move the inch instead of just giving me another chance to fail? I guess I can try it once, but I'm not convinced it'll change much.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the numbness and freezing is still leading to more self-criticism. What if, when your hand goes numb and you freeze, you *acknowledge that feeling* – not to try to change it, but to see what happens when you notice it "just as it is"* – and then *ask yourself what would be possible if you could just move your hand one tiny inch*?

Patient: When my hand goes numb I usually just shut down, so acknowledging it feels small and I’m already kind of spent saying that. If I could move it one inch, maybe it would be proof the panic doesn't have the last word — enough to give a tiny bit of momentum to do something else afterwards. But honestly, how is that really different from other little experiments that just end with me bailing and feeling worse?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the pattern of shutting down, but it's still hard to see the difference between this tiny experiment and the others that didn't work out. What if, instead of trying to change the outcome, you could *try to notice what matters to you in this moment* – not about whether it works or not, but about what matters to you right now?

Patient: Right now what matters is not collapsing — having at least one person who sees me, and doing a tiny creative thing so I'm not just a walking syllabus. I can say that, but... how is that supposed to help when the panic swallows me and I can't even move my hand? I can try to notice it, but I'm already low on energy and not sure this'll change much.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to connect with what matters to you, but the panic is still overwhelming. What if, when the panic shows up, you could *make room for it* – not to change it, but to notice it "as the space that makes it hard to draw"* – and then *ask yourself what matters to you when you have that space*?

Patient: I can try to make room for it, but my chest tightens and I feel numb and drained just saying that — it's hard to imagine that space won't swallow me. What matters then is not collapsing, having one person who really sees me, and doing something tiny that proves I’m more than classes. But seriously — how is noticing that “space” supposed to help me actually move my hand an inch instead of freezing up and feeling worse?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling to imagine the space as a refuge, not a threat. What if, instead of trying to push the numbness away, you could *try to notice what matters to you in the exact moment when it feels like the numbness is most intense* – not about changing it, but about what shows up for you in that moment?

Patient: When the numbness is worst I feel flat and almost not there — like I'm just a shell. What matters then is someone really seeing me and doing one tiny creative thing so I'm not only a student. But seriously — how is noticing that in the moment supposed to make my hand move an inch instead of just turning into another way I fail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the numbness is just adding to the feeling of being disconnected. What if, when that happens, you could *try to notice the tiny thing that matters to you in the moment that doesn't feel numb at all* – like the fact that you're still breathing, or the sound of your heart beating, or the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay... I can try noticing my breath or my feet, but it all blurs when the numbness hits — like I'm reaching for something I can't grab. How exactly is noticing that supposed to make my hand move an inch instead of just another failed attempt? I'll try one tiny cue, but it has to be something concrete and stupidly simple I can remember when I'm blanking.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your breath or feet is like trying to grasp a handful of sand – it slips right through. What if, instead of trying to notice those things, you could *make a tiny commitment to yourself* – just a tiny, ridiculously simple thing that you could do if your hand didn't move, like "I'll notice my breath for one second" or "I'll look at my hand and say 'hello'"?

Patient: Okay... I'll try one stupidly simple thing: when I start blanking, I'll look at my hand and say "hello" — just that. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the freeze? Thinking about all this is draining, and it feels like one more tiny test I might bail on, but I'll try it once and tell you what happens.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already feeling exhausted and like one more tiny step might be too much. When you try looking at your hand and saying "hello", what would *happen to your hand* if you just *did* that tiny thing – not to fix the freeze, but just to see what shows up?

Patient: Probably nothing dramatic — my hand would mostly stay there, maybe a tiny twitch or a cold numb feeling, and I'd say "hello" out loud and feel kind of ridiculous. Then I'd likely freeze and immediately start beating myself up for not doing more. If that’s all that happens, how is that supposed to actually help me move past the freeze?

Therapist: It sounds like you're expecting something more dramatic to happen, but instead, your hand stays put and you still feel like you're failing. What if, instead of trying to change the outcome, you could *acknowledge that feeling* – not to fix it, but just to see what it takes to be present with it?

Patient: Alright. I can try to just name it — like saying to myself, "that's the panic, that's the numbness," and notice what comes up instead of trying to make it go away. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when this always ends with me freezing and then beating myself up? I'll try it now and tell you what happens.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the pattern, but you're worried it won't work. When you try naming the panic and numbness, what would *happen to the freeze* if you just *let it be there for a second* – not to fix it, but just to see what shows up next?

Patient: Maybe if I let it sit for a second the freeze would loosen — like a tiny twitch or the numbness thinning out. But honestly, it usually just gets louder and I shut down and then beat myself up, so how is one second supposed to make any real difference? This is heavy and it's taking a lot, but… I'll try to let it be for one second and see what shows up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the weight of trying to make it matter, but you're willing to try. When you let the freeze sit for one second, what's the smallest *action* that you could take next – not to change it, but just to show up with it?

Patient: If I let the freeze sit for a second, the smallest thing I can do is rest my fingertips on the sketchbook edge and say "hello" to my hand while letting out a slow exhale. It feels kind of pathetic and I'm already bracing for it to do nothing, but I can try it once. My voice will probably be flat and my hand might barely move, but maybe that little proof is enough to keep me from collapsing.
