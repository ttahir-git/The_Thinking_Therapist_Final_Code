--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck in this loop where I harshly criticize myself over small perceived failures — like if I drop the ball on something at work I just know it's going to spiral into getting fired, losing my place, being completely alone. Since I moved away from my main support system it's gotten way worse; my brain feels like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I also have PTSD stuff, and those disaster stories hook me so fast I can't seem to pull myself out.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: That fortune-telling machine must be really loud for you right now. When you imagine getting fired, losing your place, and being alone – what's the smallest part of that story that you're actually trying to hold onto – what matters most about that outcome?

Patient: That it proves I'm fundamentally unreliable — like it's not just one job, it's a signal that everything I care about will crash. I can already see the dominoes: one mistake, fired, evicted, friends drift away, and I'm left alone with nothing that matters. Saying anything else feels like lying to myself; my brain treats the smaller, kinder outcomes as impossible.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: The thought of being "fundamentally unreliable" feels really important to you right now – like it's what matters most about that worst-case scenario. When you notice that "fundamental unreliability" showing up for you, what happens if you were to hold onto it just for a moment – not to change it, but just to see what matters about it while it's there?

Patient: When I hold onto it, my chest tightens and my brain goes into overdrive — images of getting fired, losing my place, friends leaving, everything collapsing play so fast it feels inevitable. I start ruminating on every tiny mistake like it's proof I'm unreliable, and that certainty just makes me panic and want to fix or escape it immediately. Even if you suggest other possibilities, it just feels like denial — I can't shake that sense that the dominoes are already falling.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding onto that "fundamental unreliability" feeling is like a weight that presses down on you, making it hard to breathe and think clearly. When the panic shows up, what would it be like to notice it – not to try to stop it, but just to see it as it is – while you still notice your desire to fix or escape?

Patient: If I try to just notice it, my chest gets tight, my hands get cold, and the worst-case scenes start playing on repeat like a movie I can't pause. Watching it doesn't make it quieter — it feels like I'm watching the fortune-telling machine rev up, and the more I look the faster it predicts disaster, so my first instinct is to do something, anything, to stop it. And honestly, when you say maybe other things could happen, that just feels like denial — I can't see anything except that collapse, and noticing it usually just makes me more frantic to escape.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like watching that panic show up is like trying to hold onto a wave while it's crashing down on you – no matter how hard you try, it just keeps coming. What if, instead of trying to stop it, you could make room for that feeling of panic to be there – just for a moment – while you're still looking for what matters about the worst-case scenario?

Patient: I've tried making room before, but it just feels like opening the door and letting the fortune-telling machine get louder — the panic spikes and the worst-case scenes speed up. In those moments the only thing that matters is that it proves I'm unreliable, and any suggestion of a kinder outcome feels like denial. I'm frustrated because I want it to stop, but making room doesn't help; it just makes me more frantic to fix things.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like making room for that panic is like trying to hold onto a thought bubble while it's blowing away – no matter how hard you try, it just keeps expanding. When the worst-case scenario feels like the only truth, what if you could notice that story showing up for you, not as the only thing that matters, but as just one thing – one small part of what's happening right now?

Patient: I get what you're saying, but when I try to treat it like "just one thing," my brain yells that it's the whole truth — the dominoes are already falling. Trying to shrink it down just feels like lying to myself and makes me more panicky, like I should be sprinting to fix everything right now. I don't know, it feels like you want me to calm down but the fortune-telling machine won't let me, and that makes me angry and exhausted.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like treating it as "just one thing" feels like a betrayal when the worst-case scenario is already feeling so overwhelming. When the fortune-telling machine is shouting that the dominoes are falling, what would it be like to notice that voice – not as the truth, but just as one small sound in the background, like the hum of a machine?

Patient: Impossible — the moment I try to tuck that voice into the background it just ramps up: my chest tightens, my thoughts sprint through getting fired, losing my place, friends leaving, everything collapsing, like I’ve given permission for the dominoes to fall. Treating it like “just background noise” feels like denial and makes me frantic to fix things right now. I'm angry and exhausted — I want it to stop, but I don't know how to make it quiet.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for the voice, it feels like you're actually making space for the worst-case scenario to show up. And when you're already feeling so overwhelmed, that's not what you need right now. What if, instead of trying to make it quiet, you could just acknowledge that feeling of being angry and exhausted – like it's there, right now – without trying to fix it?

Patient: Okay — I'm angry and exhausted, I can say that. But saying it feels like admitting defeat, like I'm giving the fortune-telling machine permission to ramp up, and then the domino scenes just get louder and I start freaking out. I want it to stop and I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm angry and exhausted" feels like a small act of defeat when the dominoes are already falling. What matters to you, even when the worst-case scenario is showing up, is that you want it to stop. What would it be like to notice that desire to stop – not as a reason to give up, but just as something that matters to you – while the dominoes are still falling?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing that desire supposed to help when the dominoes are already falling? The second I try to focus on wanting it to stop, my chest tightens and the fortune-telling machine just speeds up, showing worse scenes and making me frantic to fix things right now. I'm confused and pissed off because every suggestion feels like it just makes the predictions louder, and I don't see a way out.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that desire to stop feels like it's getting pulled out of you when the worst-case scenario shows up. When the chest tightens and the predictions get louder, what would happen if you let that tightness stay there while you still looked for what matters about wanting it to stop?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is letting the tightness stay supposed to help? Whenever I try that, my brain treats it like permission and the fortune-teller ramps up: getting fired, losing my place, friends leaving, everything collapsing, and I start panicking and scrambling to fix things right away. I'm confused and pissed because I want it to stop but every approach just seems to make the predictions louder, and I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like every approach you try feels like it's making the predictions louder, and that's what matters to you right now – finding a way to make the predictions stop. When the predictions show up like that, what matters most to you – what matters enough to make it worth noticing – is that you want them to stop.

Patient: What matters most is that the predictions stop — because if they don't, it's not just anxiety, it's the whole domino sequence: one mistake, fired, evicted, friends drift away, and I'm left proving I'm fundamentally unreliable. I want it to stop so I can feel stable and not like everything's collapsing, but I don't see how just "noticing" that desire would actually change anything — I'm not sure I follow how that helps. I'm exhausted and pissed off because every time I try something it just seems to make the fortune-teller louder and I don't know what else to do.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the predictions matter because they're connected to your sense of being fundamentally unreliable – and that's what matters most to you right now. When you notice the desire to stop the predictions, what matters most is that you don't want to be left with that feeling of unreliability. What if, instead of trying to change the predictions, you looked at what matters most to you – staying stable and not feeling like everything's collapsing – while the predictions are still showing up?

Patient: I don't see how that's possible — the second I try to hold onto "stability" while the predictions run, my brain screams that I'm lying to myself and it cranks the worst scenes up. It feels like the fortune-teller will just prove me wrong and everything collapses anyway. I'm angry and exhausted because I want it to stop but I don't know how to hold onto that without it getting louder.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold onto "stability" while the predictions are still showing up, your brain feels like it's not working – like you're lying to yourself. And that feeling of not being able to hold onto stability matters to you. What matters most to you, even when the predictions are still showing up, is that you don't want to feel like you're not being true to yourself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? The second I try to hold onto being "true to myself" the fortune-teller revs up and the dominoes play out in my head faster, and I start panicking that I'm lying to myself and everything will collapse. I'm angry and exhausted because I want to feel stable but I don't know how to keep that without the predictions getting louder and making me scramble to fix everything right now.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to hold onto being "true to yourself" while the predictions are still showing up is actually making things worse. When the predictions show up like that, what matters most to you right now is not being able to feel stable. Can you notice that feeling of not being able to feel stable – like it's there, right now – without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm trying, but the second I try to just notice it my brain treats that like permission and the fortune-teller revs up — chest tightens, my thoughts sprint through getting fired, losing my place, friends leaving. I don't get how "not changing it" wouldn't make it louder; how am I supposed to hold that feeling without it turning into full-blown panic?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to just notice the feeling of not being able to feel stable, your brain is already making it worse by treating that noticing like permission for the fortune-teller to rev up. That's a really tough cycle to break. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the feeling, you could look at what matters most to you right now – what matters enough to make it worth noticing – even if it feels like it's being pulled out of you?

Patient: What matters most is not falling apart — feeling like I can be steady and not prove I'm fundamentally unreliable. But the second I try to hold onto that, this shame wells up and the fortune-teller just starts shouting worse scenarios until I panic; it honestly feels like admitting I want stability is admitting defeat. I'm confused and pissed off and really ashamed, and I don't see how looking at "what matters" won't just make the predictions louder. So what do I actually do in that moment — because everything I've tried just seems to make it worse and I don't know where to go from here.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're not just trying to hold onto stability, but you're also deeply connected to the shame and the feeling of admitting defeat – and that's what matters most to you right now. 

When you say "I don't see how looking at 'what matters' won't just make the predictions louder," what if the predictions aren't what matters most to you right now – what if the shame and the feeling of defeat matter more?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the shame any different? The shame already feels like proof the fortune-teller's right; when I notice it it just fuels the predictions and the domino scenes get louder. I'm angry, ashamed, and confused, and it feels like admitting the shame is admitting defeat, so I don't know what to do instead — everything I've tried just makes the machine scream louder.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame is already fueling the predictions, and when you notice it, that just makes things worse. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the shame or the predictions, you could just notice them right now – without trying to change them? Not to stop the shame, but just to notice what's happening when you notice it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the second I try to "just notice," that shame flares up and the fortune-telling machine goes full blast, so noticing feels like giving it permission. It doesn't stay neutral; it just becomes more proof that I'm unreliable and the dominoes are already falling, and then I panic. I want it to stop but I don't see how noticing won't just make it worse — what am I actually supposed to do in that moment?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame and the predictions feels like it's already making things worse, and that's what matters most to you right now. 

What if, instead of trying to change what's happening when you notice the shame, you could look at what matters most to you right now – what matters enough to make it worth noticing – while the shame and the predictions are still showing up?

Patient: Maybe what matters is not proving I'm unreliable — I want to feel steady — but the second I try to hold that the shame spikes (like that thing I keep replaying) and the fortune-teller goes full blast, so I can't keep it without panicking. I don't know how to hold "what matters" without it just making everything worse right now.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding onto what matters to you right now – feeling steady – is actually making it harder to notice it when the shame and the predictions are showing up.

Patient: Yeah… when I try to hold onto “steady,” my chest tightens and that fortune-telling machine just screams louder — I start replaying that one mistake and it feels like proof everything will collapse. I don't know how to hold onto what matters without making the predictions worse, and I feel too drained to keep fighting it. What do I actually do in the moment when the machine revs up and I’m already panicking?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're running out of energy and feeling like you can't keep fighting it. What if, in that moment when the machine revs up and you start panicking, you could make room for the panic itself – not to stop it, but just to notice it – without trying to change it?

Patient: I can't... the moment I try to "make room" the fortune-teller just gets louder and that one failure I keep replaying swallows everything, and then I'm scrambling to fix it. I don't have the energy to sit with it without it exploding into full panic — so what do I actually do in that moment? I just feel stuck and ashamed and don't know how to stop the spiral.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to "make room" for the panic, it's actually making things worse. 

What if, in that moment when the machine revs up and you start panicking, you could just notice one thing – one tiny thing – that matters to you right now, without trying to change it? Not to stop the panic, but just to notice what's there, right in front of you.

Patient: Maybe I could try to notice one tiny thing—like the tightness in my chest or the hum of the lamp—but the moment I focus my brain turns it into proof the dominoes are already falling. Then that replay of the mistake floods in, I start panicking and scrambling to fix everything, and I don't have the energy to ride that out so I don't see how this would help.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice that tiny thing, your brain is already using it to fuel the worst-case scenario. 

What if, instead of trying to notice it as "proof" or "failure," you could try noticing it as just "this" – the tightness in your chest, the hum of the lamp – without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know how — every time I try to treat it like "just this," my brain grabs the tightness and turns it into proof the dominoes are falling, and that replay wells up and makes me feel ashamed and sick. I'm too drained for it to stay neutral; the moment I try, the fortune-teller just yells louder and I start freaking out. How am I actually supposed to notice it as "this" without it instantly becoming proof I'm doomed?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice it as "this," your brain is already using it to fuel the worst-case scenario. 

What if, instead of trying to change it or notice it as "this," you could just let the feeling of shame and sickness be there – without trying to stop it – while you notice one tiny thing that matters to you right now? Not to change it, but just to notice what's there, right in front of you.

Patient: I can try, but I don't trust it—whenever I let the shame sit and aim for one tiny thing, my brain grabs that thing and makes it into proof everything's collapsing. Like if I notice my breath or the lamp, my chest tightens and that replay of the mistake floods me and I feel sick and frozen. I don't have the energy to ride it out—what do I actually do in that moment when the machine starts screaming?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to trust that noticing one tiny thing could help. 

What if, instead of trying to notice it as "proof" or "failure," you could try noticing it as the moment you stop trying to change it – the moment you stop fighting the shame and the machine screaming. Not to stop the machine, but to notice what happens when you stop trying to stop it.

Patient: I don't get it — the second I try to "stop trying," the fortune-telling machine treats that like permission and its worst-case scenes just accelerate, and that shame I keep replaying floods me. It hollows me out and I'm already scrambling to fix things, so I can't see how noticing that moment wouldn't just make it louder. I want to believe it could help, but I'm worn down and skeptical—what would that actually look like when the machine starts roaring?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to "stop trying" to change the shame, it's actually making things worse. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the machine or change the shame, you could just notice what happens when you stop trying to change it? Not to stop the machine, but to notice the sensation of your body when you're not trying to fix it. What would that feel like?

Patient: When I actually stop trying, there's this hollow ache — my chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, my hands go cold and a hot shame wells up like I just ruined everything. Maybe there's a flicker of relief for a second, then the fortune-teller screams louder and that replay of the mistake floods me and I feel sick and frozen. I don't know how to hold that without it exploding into full panic — what am I supposed to do in that moment?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you stop trying to change the shame, the hollow ache comes up – and it's intense. 

What if, in that moment when the hollow ache shows up, you could just lean into it – not to fix it, but to notice what it feels like to be with it, without trying to change it. Not to stop the machine, but to notice what happens when you're not trying to stop the machine.

Patient: I don't get it — when I try to lean into that hollow ache it just opens up the shame and the fortune-teller goes full blast, replaying that mistake until I'm panicking and convinced the dominoes are already falling, so I end up scrambling to fix everything. I'm too drained to ride it out and I don't see how leaning in wouldn't just make it worse; what am I actually supposed to do in that moment?
