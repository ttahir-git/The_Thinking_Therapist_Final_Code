Patient: Hi, I'm an elderly nurse — since a really tough breakup I've been drowning in sadness and have almost no motivation, and it's spilling into my relationships and my work. I've dealt with OCD for years, and lately it just makes everything feel stuck and impossible to shift. I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and it didn't work, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight right now, and it's really tough to imagine finding the energy to keep going. 

What would it be like for you if, for just a moment, you could notice that "stuck" feeling without trying to push it away or fix it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I’ve heard “sit with it” a million times and it just turns into wallowing or makes my rituals louder. 

But if I try to imagine it — it’s like a heavy weight in my chest and my hands start twitching for something to do, like the compulsions kick in. If I could notice it without fixing it, maybe it wouldn’t hijack me so fast and might feel less urgent…though I’m not sure I’d actually be able to do that.

Therapist: It feels like you're trying to hold onto what might happen if you let go, even if it feels scary or uncertain. 

Can you try noticing that "heavy weight" in your chest right now, without trying to push it away or stop the twitching? Not to fix it, just to see what it feels like – like you're observing it, but not trying to control it.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try, though I don’t know this will help. It feels like a heavy pressure in the middle of my chest, my breathing gets shallow, and my hands start twitching like they want to wash or check something. Noticing it makes the urge still there, maybe a tiny bit less frantic, but most times “noticing” just turns into me spiraling and doing the ritual. How is that supposed to help when the compulsion gets louder?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the pressure is actually helping you see it more clearly, even if it feels like it's not making the urge go away. 

What matters isn't that the urge goes away – it's that you're noticing it right now, without trying to stop it. If the compulsion gets louder, what would happen if you could stay with that feeling of noticing for just one more second?

Patient: I guess if I stayed one more second maybe the urge would crest and start to ease instead of me instantly giving in — but most times it just keeps building until I do the ritual. How is that supposed to help when I'm already thinking about doing it and feel like I can't stand it? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles and I get frustrated.

Therapist: It sounds like the frustration is showing up when you feel like you're not making progress – but the truth is, you are noticing it, even if it feels like you're stuck. 

Let's try to take one step back: what matters most for you right now – not what you think you "should" be doing, but what you actually care about – is being able to show up in your work and relationships without letting the OCD take over.

Patient: Yeah — what matters to me is being able to show up at work and for the people I care about without the OCD and this post-breakup sadness wrecking everything. How is that supposed to help, though? I keep hearing the same “notice it” stuff — I wake up exhausted, the rituals get louder, and honestly I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we keep circling and I get frustrated, so can we try something concrete that might actually change how I act in the moment?

Therapist: I hear you're tired of the same conversations and feeling stuck. 

Instead of noticing it, what if we tried making room for what matters – showing up at work and for the people you care about – right now, even when the OCD and sadness are loud?

Patient: Okay — but how is "making room" supposed to help when the urge hits in the middle of a busy shift? I need something concrete I can do in 20–30 seconds between patients — a grounding cue or a short phrase to say out loud that actually interrupts the compulsion, not the usual breathing stuff that just makes me spiral. I'm willing to try one thing now, but I'm frustrated and skeptical because we've tried similar stuff before and it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist: I can see you're looking for a specific tool to help in that moment. 

What if, instead of trying to "make room" or "notice it," you could use a simple phrase that acknowledges the urge, like: "I'm here to care for my patient, and I can check in with that need for care right after."

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I need something shorter and sharper I can do in 20 seconds between patients — not a whole speech. 

Maybe something like a tiny mantra I can mumble under my breath, like "Patient first — check later," while pinching my thumb and forefinger or tapping my name badge three times. Can we try that now? I'm skeptical — we've done stuff like this before and it fizzled, and honestly I'm feeling overwhelmed and not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist: I can see you're looking for something concrete and quick. 

Let's try that tiny mantra and action: "Patient first — check later." What if, just for 20 seconds, you pinched your thumb and forefinger or tapped your badge three times, and whispered that to yourself while you're checking that patient's chart?

Patient: Okay — I tried it: pinched my thumb and forefinger and whispered "Patient first — check later" while scanning a chart. It did give me a tiny pause, like the urge didn't grab me instantly, but my hands were still twitching and the compulsion kept hovering. How is that supposed to help when I get maybe a second or two before the ritual ramps back up? I'm still lugging this heavy sadness from the breakup too, which makes everything worse — can we tweak it to something that lasts through a whole patient encounter, or a visible cue I can glance at instead of whispering? I'm feeling frustrated and skeptical, not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the pause was small, but it matters that it happened. 

Let's try to make that pause longer. What if, while scanning the chart, you glanced down at a small piece of paper on your desk with a single word written on it – "Focus"?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? A quick glance might buy me a second, but at the bedside the compulsion still nags at me. Maybe it needs to be something I can see or touch the whole time — like a tiny "Focus" sticker on my name badge or a ring I can twist while I'm with a patient so the pause lasts through the whole encounter. I'm willing to try one concrete visible/tactile cue, but I'm skeptical and kind of overwhelmed — can we pick one and test it now?

Therapist: It sounds like you need something that can stay with you throughout the patient encounter. 

Let's try the ring. What if, while scanning the chart, you twisted the ring on your finger and kept it there throughout the patient conversation?

Patient: I tried it — I twisted my ring while I scanned the chart and kept fiddling with it through the whole patient encounter. It actually helped a little — my hands had something to do and the urge didn't grab me straight away — but it faded after a bit and the compulsion still came back later in the shift. How is that supposed to help when it only buys me a few minutes? I'm getting frustrated and overwhelmed; can we tweak it — like a specific twisting pattern or a short phrase to pair with it that might actually last through an entire shift?

Therapist: It sounds like the ring helped a little, but the urge came back. 

Let's try to make the twisting more consistent. What if, while scanning the chart, you twisted the ring 3 times clockwise and then 3 times counterclockwise, and repeated that pattern every time you checked a chart?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try the 3‑by‑3 twist pattern, but in real life the fiddling fades after a few minutes and the compulsion sneaks back in. Maybe we pair the pattern with a tiny whisper like "patient first" and a visible cue on my badge so it stays with me through the whole encounter — can we try that tweak now? I'm frustrated and overwhelmed; it feels like we're circling, but I can test one concrete change if you want me to.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to keep the pattern consistent and the whisper with you. 

Let's try the 3-by-3 twist pattern with the "patient first" whisper and the visible cue on your badge. What if, while scanning the chart, you twisted your ring 3 times clockwise, whispered "patient first," and then glanced down at your badge to make sure you saw the word "Focus"?

Patient: Okay — I tried it during a patient: three twists, whispered "patient first," and glanced at "Focus" on my badge. It did give me a little more time and my hands calmed for a bit, but the compulsion came back mid-encounter and the whisper started to feel hollow. How is that supposed to help when it fades? I'm feeling drained by this and honestly not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're circling.

Therapist: It sounds like the whisper felt hollow, and the compulsion came back. 

Let's try to make the whisper more connected to what matters for you. What if, instead of just whispering "patient first," you whispered something like "I'm here to care for my patient, even when I'm struggling"?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Saying that whole line between patients feels clumsy — too long. I tried something like it once and it hit for a second, then went hollow and my hands started twitching again. This is getting exhausting; can we try a tiny, sharp phrase I can actually blurt out fast — like "I'm here now" — and a concrete backup for when the compulsion spikes mid-encounter? I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you need something simple and sharp. 

Let's try "I'm here now." What if, when you feel the compulsion spike, you quickly glance down at your badge and twist the ring 3 times clockwise, while blurring out "I'm here now" without thinking about it?

Patient: I tried it — three twists, a quick "I'm here now," and a glance at Focus; it bought me a tiny pause but then felt hollow and the compulsion crept back mid-encounter. How is that supposed to help when it only gives me a second? I'm pretty wiped and not sure where to go from here — can we tweak it to something stronger I can do without thinking when the spike hits?

Therapist: It sounds like you need something that can help you hold onto the pause a bit longer. 

Let's try adding a small physical action to the 3 twists and "I'm here now." What if, when you feel the compulsion spike, you twist your ring 3 times clockwise, quickly say "I'm here now," and then pinch the corner of your eye (just lightly) for a second?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Pinching the corner of my eye sounds awkward and like it’d draw attention — and even with the ring and phrase my hands still twitch and the urge sneaks back. It might buy me a second, but then I’m left feeling spent and frustrated; can we try one simpler, more automatic cue I can do without thinking when the spike hits — like pressing my thumb to my sternum or snapping a rubber band on my wrist?

Therapist: It sounds like you need something small and automatic to help you pause. 

Let's try a simple action that might work: snapping a rubber band on your wrist. What if, when you feel the compulsion spike, you quickly snap the band without thinking about it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I've snapped bands before — it's jarring and draws attention, and the urge usually still wins after a moment. I can try it once, but I'd prefer something quieter I can do without anyone noticing, like pressing my thumb to my sternum or squeezing my other hand; it feels less… awkward. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty worn out and not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you need something quiet and discreet to help you pause. 

Let's try pressing your thumb to your sternum. What if, when you feel the compulsion spike, you quickly press your thumb to your sternum without thinking about it, just for a second?

Patient: I tried pressing my thumb to my sternum during a spike — it gave a tiny grounding, like half a beat, but the compulsion still crept back and I ended up doing the ritual. How is that supposed to help when it only buys a second? I'm feeling drained and stuck in circles; can we try a tweak — press for three slow counts and pair it with a silent word like "now," or hold a small smooth stone in my hand through the whole patient encounter to see if that actually lasts longer?

Therapist: It sounds like pressing your thumb to your sternum gave you a small moment of grounding, but the compulsion still came back. 

Let's try adding a bit more time to the press, and pairing it with a silent word. What if, when you feel the compulsion spike, you press your thumb to your sternum for three slow counts, and say "now" silently to yourself, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay... I'll try the three slow counts and the silent "now" — but it brings up that same wash of shame and makes me doubt it'll hold. How is that supposed to help when I press and then still end up giving in mid-encounter? I'll try it once more on the next patient, but I'm feeling pretty worn thin and skeptical.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and doubt are still showing up, even when you're trying to press through it. 

Let's try to make space for that feeling instead of trying to push it away. What if, when you feel the shame and doubt, you notice it as a part of what matters to you – not the thing that matters, but what matters for you to be able to care for your patient, even when it feels hard?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Noticing the shame usually just floods me and makes my hands twitch — it makes me feel like a fraud and I freeze up. I could try naming it silently as "shame" and then press my thumb to my sternum for three slow counts before I act, but I'm skeptical it'll hold any longer than the other tricks. I'm worn out and still not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame just makes it worse. 

Let's try to make the press for three slow counts feel more like a choice, not just a thing to do. What if, when you feel the shame and doubt, you say to yourself "I choose to press my thumb to my sternum, not because it will fix everything, but because it matters to me to be able to care for my patient right now"?

Patient: I can try saying that — "I choose to press my thumb..." — and hold it for three slow counts, but I really doubt it'll do much; naming the choice just brings up that same wash of shame and makes me feel like a fraud. How is that supposed to help when my hands are already moving and the ritual feels inevitable? I'm worn out and not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like naming the choice doesn't feel like enough to change the feeling of shame. 

Let's try something else. What if, when you feel the shame and doubt, and your hands are already moving towards the ritual, you simply notice that feeling – "This shame feels like it's moving my hand" – without trying to change it or push it away? Just notice it, as a sensation, for one moment.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Noticing it like that just makes me feel like a fraud — the shame floods in and my hand's already halfway to the ritual. Maybe saying "this shame is moving my hand" silently for one quiet breath could yank me out of autopilot, so I'll try it next time, but I don't have much hope and it all feels pretty draining.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame makes it feel like you're failing, and that's what's keeping you stuck. 

Let's try something different. What if, when you notice the shame moving your hand, you don't try to stop it or change it. What if, instead, you simply say to yourself "I am not that hand"? Not "I am not a fraud," but "I am not that hand that's moving towards the ritual".

Patient: How is that supposed to help? "I am not that hand" sounds weird, but I'll try saying it silently the next time my hand starts moving — though even thinking about it brings this hot shame and I feel like a failure. I'm not optimistic it will stop the ritual, but I'll try and tell you what happens.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I am not that hand" feels like a stretch, even when you try it. 

What matters most is that you're willing to try it again, even when it feels hard. When you're ready, what happens to the ritual when you say it to yourself, silently, just for a moment?

Patient: I tried saying "I am not that hand" silently once — for a split second my fingers hesitated, like there was a tiny distance. Then this hot shame just flooded me and the motion took over anyway; it felt dumb and not enough. How is that supposed to help when the shame always drags me back? I'm wiped and honestly don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the hesitation was fleeting, and the shame was still overwhelming. 

Let's try to make space for that feeling of being "not enough". What if, instead of trying to change your hand, you simply noticed that it's not enough to stop the ritual? Not because it matters, but because it matters to you to be able to try again.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Noticing it's "not enough" just unleashes this hot shame — I feel like a fraud and my hand moves before I can do a thing. I'll try to notice it next time, but I'm pretty drained and not hopeful; it already feels like we're circling.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing it's "not enough" feels like a trigger for shame. 

Let's try something else. What if, instead of trying to notice the shame, you simply focused on making room for the next moment? Just for the next second, what would it be like if you let the shame be there, and still moved towards your patient?

Patient: Maybe... If I let the shame sit there and still move toward the patient, it feels like walking with a sack of stones — my hands tremble and my chest tightens, but maybe it would stop me from doing the ritual instantly. How is that supposed to help when the shame usually swallows me and the motion takes over? I can try it with the next patient, but I'm pretty worn thin and not feeling hopeful — can you give me one tiny, do‑able instruction for that exact second?

Therapist: It sounds like letting the shame sit there, even if it's still painful, feels like it might make a tiny difference. 

Here's one tiny instruction for that exact second: When you feel the shame rising up, just say "I'm here" to yourself. Not "I'm a failure," or "I'll never be able to do this," but just "I'm here."

Patient: I tried whispering "I'm here" once — it gave a sliver of space, then that hot shame crashed back and my hand kept moving. How is that supposed to help when the pause disappears? I need one tiny, automatic anchor I can do in that split second that I won't have to think about.
