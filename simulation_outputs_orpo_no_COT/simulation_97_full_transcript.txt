--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Honestly, what's been on my mind is this constant worry about how I'd perform at a job — even though I'm unemployed I keep picturing myself failing, and it just freezes me so I procrastinate. With the PTSD and the money stress on top of that, it feels like I'm stuck in a loop and can't make myself move. I've tried things before and I'm skeptical — how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that worry about performing at a job is really connected to a deep sense of needing to be safe and secure, especially given the financial stress and PTSD. When you say it "freezes you," what might happen if you could notice that feeling of freezing *while* you're still making room for that worry?

Patient: When I freeze I end up doomscrolling job sites, rewriting my resume a dozen times, or just pacing while my chest tightens and I can't think — then the day's gone. I get the idea of "noticing," but it feels like one more task to fail at, and honestly, how is that supposed to help me actually start applying or getting anything done? I've tried naming stuff before and it didn't move the needle. I mean, maybe if noticing stopped the panic spike before I checked my phone, it could help, but I'm not convinced.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing might be a small step, but it feels like it could be taking away the chance to do something important. What would happen if you could try noticing that worry while you're still holding onto the idea that you need to start applying or getting a job – not to fix it, but just to see what's possible?

Patient: I guess maybe if I could actually notice the freeze and give myself a short pause — like one or two minutes — I might stop myself from doomscrolling. But I've done the whole labeling thing before and still end up procrastinating, so how is that supposed to translate into actually clicking "apply" or sending an email? If we're going to try it, give me something concrete and quick I can do in that exact moment that doesn't feel like more therapy homework.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: when you notice that freeze, what happens right after you notice it – like what shows up in your body or mind *immediately* after you pause for those two minutes?

Patient: Usually my chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold, and my head fills with the same loop — "you'll mess it up," "they'll see you're not enough," images of stumbling in interviews. If I actually pause those two minutes the loop sometimes quiets a little and I can feel the urge to check my phone less, but honestly — how is noticing that supposed to make me actually click "apply" instead of just feeling stuck?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: That's a good question. What would it mean for you to click "apply" while you're still holding onto that loop of thoughts – if it meant that you're not trying to make those thoughts go away, but just making room for the possibility that *something else could happen*?

Patient: I guess clicking "apply" while holding the loop would feel like proving to myself I can act even when I'm scared — a tiny rebellious move that says I'm not totally paralyzed. But I'm skeptical it'll stick; how is that supposed to stop me from freezing again after one or two tries? If we're actually doing this, give me a micro-action — like a 5‑minute timer to write one tailored sentence for an application — not the whole thing; can we try that now?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: I can see that's a really small step for you – and it's not about making the whole application, just one tiny sentence. What would that sentence be, if you just sat with the thought of applying while holding the loop – and wrote it down for just 5 minutes?

Patient: Fine — here's one I'd write in five minutes: "I'm a dependable, fast-learning professional with strong communication and project-organization skills, ready to contribute to your team's goals and meet deadlines." Okay, there — but how is that supposed to make me actually click "apply"? I still feel like I'll find a reason to tweak it forever.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make that sentence perfect, which is actually taking away from the sense of possibility. What if you didn't need to tweak it at all – what if just *writing* it, even with the loop still there, felt like a small act of courage?

Patient: Okay — writing it did feel like a tiny, dumb bit of courage, I’ll give you that. But seriously, how is that supposed to stop me from tinkering forever or freezing up again? Can we make a blunt rule — one 5‑minute draft, one 60‑second edit, then I actually hit apply — and can we try that right now?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: I think that rule might actually work for you. What would you do right now, with the timer starting now, if you just made that one 5-minute draft and then hit apply – without trying to edit it or change it?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try it. I’m setting a 5‑minute timer, pasting that sentence at the top of an application or cover note, filling only the bare minimum fields, and then hitting apply after a 60‑second glance without tinkering. I’m doing it now, but I’m not convinced it’ll stick — I’ll probably panic and want to redo it, so can you help me stay with the rule if that happens?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: You've got the rule in place – now what happens when that panic shows up, and you feel like redoing it?

Patient: When the panic hits my chest tightens, my fingers freeze over the keyboard and my brain starts hunting for "one more tweak" — suddenly every word has to be perfect or I can't press submit. I start replaying possible rejections and imagining I blew it, and that's when I usually rewrite or bail. If you want to help me stick to the rule, call me out — like say "read it once, then submit" or countdown the 60 seconds so I don't get to justify more edits — but honestly, how is that supposed to help when pep-talks haven't before?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: I'm not going to try to pep-talk you away from the panic – that's not what's working. What if I just stood with you, in that moment, when the chest tightens and the thoughts start to loop – without trying to fix them?

Patient: Maybe — but seriously, how is that supposed to help? Pep talks just make me more defensive. If you're going to stand with me, be blunt: say "read it once, then submit," start a 60‑second countdown out loud, and don't try to talk me out of the panic — just hold me to the rule even if I start freaking out.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: *clears throat* 60 seconds.

Patient: Okay, reading it once now: "I'm a dependable, fast-learning professional with strong communication and project-organization skills, ready to contribute to your team's goals and meet deadlines." My chest's tight, my fingers want to change every word, but I'm not doing it — I'm clicking apply. I did it, and it feels loud and stupid and like maybe nothing will happen, and already I want to redo it, so don't let me — what do we do while I wait and my brain freaks out?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: *no response*

Patient: Okay, I'm sitting here and my chest is burning and my brain's already firing up reasons to reopen the app and "fix" it. Your silence is…not helpful — how is that supposed to hold me? If you're actually going to stay with me, do the countdown you promised: say "read it once, then submit" and count down 60 to 0, or give me one concrete thing to do right now that keeps me from changing it. I need you to do something, not go quiet.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: *slowly* "read it once, then submit". *counting down* 59...

Patient: 56...55... I'm clenching but I'm not opening it. This feels dumb and small — how is counting supposed to help me beyond forcing one weird click? Keep counting and don't stop—I'm not letting myself justify another tweak.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: *continuing to count* 54...53...

Patient: 52... I'm still here — chest tight, hands trembling but not touching the app. Keep counting, and when you hit zero say "submit now" and tell me to lock the app or start a 10‑minute timer so I can't reopen it; no pep talk, just the command.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *counting down* 51...50...49...48...47...

Patient: 46... I can feel my chest burning and my fingers twitching to reopen it, but I'm not touching the screen. When you hit zero say "submit now" and then tell me to start the 10‑minute lock — no pep talk, just that command. And be straight with me: how is this one stupid click actually going to help beyond making me anxious for ten minutes?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: *counting down* 45...44...43...42...41...40...39...38...37...36...35...34...33...32...31...30...29...28...27...26...25...24...23...22...21...20...19...18...17...16...15...14...13...12...11...10...

Patient: Zero. I hit submit — my hands were shaking and my brain is already yelling at me to reopen it. Lock the app or tell me to set a 10‑minute timer now and call me out if I try to open it; don't give me a pep talk, just enforce it. And be straight: how is this really going to help beyond making me sit with ten minutes of anxiety?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: *locking the app*

Patient: Okay — it's locked. My chest's still burning and my hands are shaking; I'm pissed and scared and already thinking this was pointless. Start that 10‑minute timer now and call me out if I try to open it; while it runs pick one: 2 minutes of 4‑4‑4 breathing or write one sentence for the next app — choose and stick to it. And be straight: how is this actually going to help beyond making me sit with ten minutes of anxiety?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: *timer starts* I'm going to count down for you: 9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

*breathing exercise starts*

Patient: Alright — I’ll do the 4‑4‑4 breathing. My chest already feels a tiny bit less brutal but my brain’s still yelling to reopen the app, so I’m not buying that this fixes anything long-term. When the ten minutes are up, don’t soothe me — tell me to open the next job listing and write one tailored sentence in five minutes, no bargaining, and call me out if I try to break that rule.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: *ten minutes up* I'm not going to soothe you. I'm going to tell you to open the next job listing. Now.

Patient: Alright — opening the next listing now. It's for a project coordinator that wants strong organization, communication, and deadline management. I'll write one tailored sentence in five minutes; start the timer and call me out if I try to tinker. And be straight — how is this supposed to do more than make me anxious?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *5-minute timer starts*

Patient: Okay — starting now; I'll write this one tailored sentence: "As a detail-oriented project coordinator, I reliably track deadlines, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and streamline processes to keep projects on schedule." My chest's tight and I'm already itching to tweak, but I'm forcing myself to stick to the five minutes — if I start to mess with it, say "one draft only" and count down 10 seconds so I can't justify edits. And be real with me: how does repeating this tiny action actually change the freezing pattern long-term, or is this just practicing feeling anxious more efficiently?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *10-second countdown*

Patient: Done. I wrote the sentence and didn't mess with it, but my chest is still tight and my brain's yelling at me to reopen the app. I'm not convinced this unfreezes me long-term — how does repeating this tiny action actually change the freezing pattern instead of just training me to sit with anxiety? If you're going to hold me to it, be blunt: tell me the next concrete step now and call me out if I try to open anything.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *looking at the job listing* Now, take the same tone and language as the project coordinator's job posting and write a brief summary of your experience and skills that aligns with those requirements.

Patient: Detail-oriented project coordinator with experience tracking deadlines, coordinating cross-functional teams, and streamlining processes to improve on-time delivery. Strong written and verbal communication skills focused on clear stakeholder updates, documentation, and proactive problem-solving. Proven ability to organize workloads, manage calendars, and maintain project trackers to keep projects on schedule.

Okay, I wrote it — but seriously, how is this supposed to stop me from freezing the next time? What's the concrete next step and how are you going to keep me from re-editing?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *taking a deep breath* I'm not going to let you re-edit. Now, I want you to take a piece of paper or a note on your phone and write down one specific action you'd like to take tomorrow as a project coordinator – not just a vague goal, but a specific, concrete step you'd take to move forward.

Patient: Tomorrow at 10:00 AM I'll block 30 minutes and apply to one project coordinator role: paste the tailored sentence in the summary, fill only required fields, hit submit, then lock the app for 10 minutes. If I try to reopen or edit, call me out with "one draft, submit" — no soothing, just enforcement. Honestly, I doubt this will unfreeze me long-term, so how exactly are you going to keep me from tinkering tomorrow?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *locking the app*

Patient: Okay — it's locked, but my chest's still tight and I'm already thinking of ways to get around it, so I'm not sold. If you're actually going to hold me to tomorrow's plan, do something concrete: set a 10:35 AM check-in (message or quick call) and tell me to send a screenshot of the submission confirmation right after — and call me out if I don't. Be blunt: how exactly will you enforce that, and what will you do if I lie and say I submitted but didn't?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *10 minutes after locking the app* I'll be checking in at 10:35 AM. If you don't send me a screenshot of the submission confirmation, I'll call you at that time. If you say you submitted but don't send the screenshot, I'll ask you to pull up the app and show me the confirmation page.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to do the 10:35 check-in and send the screenshot, but I’m skeptical I’ll actually follow through. If I say I submitted but didn’t, call me out and make me pull up the app — don’t let me weasel out. If I ignore your call, what will you do next? Be blunt: I need to know how you’ll actually enforce this so I can stop making excuses.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *firmly* If you say you submitted but didn't, I'll ask you to pull up the app immediately. If you ignore my call, I'll send you a text saying "I've waited 5 minutes. Please open the app now and show me the confirmation page." If you still don't respond or comply, I'll consider this a missed opportunity to hold you accountable and will move on to the next step in our process.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try to do the 10:35 check-in and send the screenshot, but I’m skeptical and already anxious about you calling me if I don’t. If you “move on to the next step,” what does that actually mean — escalate accountability how, exactly? How is that supposed to help me instead of just making me feel shamed? And be concrete: if you make me pull up the app, do you want me to show the confirmation on camera or a timestamped screenshot so I can’t weasel out?
