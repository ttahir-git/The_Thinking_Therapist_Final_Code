--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been caught in this loop of harshly criticizing myself for tiny slip-ups — I struggled in school so I keep telling myself I'm basically a failure even though I somehow became a nurse. My brain immediately spins the worst story: if I make a mistake at work they'll all notice, I'll get reported, lose my license, end up unemployed and alone, and everything I've worked for will collapse. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but that feels unrealistic — I just know that's what's going to happen.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When that worst-case story shows up, what's the one tiny step you could take – even just for a moment – to hold that story while you're still making decisions at work?

Patient: I could name it out loud—“that’s my disaster story”—then take one slow breath and lock onto one tiny next task, like checking the med list or chart. It feels a bit like pretending, but if I can keep the worst-story in a little corner of my head while I do the next thing, maybe it won't shove me off course.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Noticing that story, even for just a moment, seems like a small act of kindness towards yourself. What would it take for you to make room for that tiny step, naming the story, *while* you do check that med list?

Patient: I could try saying out loud, “That’s my disaster story,” take one slow breath, then touch the chart and focus on checking the med list item-by-item. Honestly, I’m skeptical — I can already hear the rest of the story in my head and worry naming it won’t stop it from roaring back and making me miss something, which will prove I was right. But I’ll try that tiny ritual anyway, maybe with a checkbox I physically tick, even if it feels like pretending.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the worry about it not stopping the story is what's holding you back – not the act of saying the words or ticking the box. What would it be like to try that tiny ritual *just for a moment*, not because you think it'll solve everything, but because you want to see what happens when you make room for that worst-case story *while* you're already doing the work of checking the med list?

Patient: It would feel like I'm faking it — saying “that’s my disaster story,” taking a breath, and pretending it won't keep screaming the rest of the script: I say the words, the panic comes back louder, I miss a med, someone notices, I get reported and lose everything. I can try it for just one med-check, even though I already think it won't stop the story — could you remind me to name it out loud and then ask me what I noticed afterward?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: The feeling of being "faking it" is what matters – not the outcome of the med-check. What's one tiny thing you could notice about that panic coming back – even if it's just that your chest feels tight, or your mind feels like it's racing – when you say the words "that's my disaster story" and take a breath?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow, and there's this loud "you're already ruined" voice that starts narrating faster. I can try to name the tightness and the "you're going to lose everything" thought when I say "that's my disaster story," even though I don't expect it to actually quiet the yelling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Just noticing the tightness and the voice – *not* trying to change them – when you say "that's my disaster story." What happens to the rest of the story – the "you're going to lose everything" part – when you're holding onto just that tightness and that voice for one more moment?

Patient: When I hold the tightness and that voice for one more moment, the catastrophic story actually loses a bit of its grip — it goes from a full-blown movie to background static, and I can usually finish that one med check without the whole script playing out. But I don't fool myself into thinking it's gone for good; it tends to sneak back later and then yells even louder, so I still expect the worst to happen eventually.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: The tightness and the voice aren't gone, but they're no longer driving the entire show – the catastrophic story is still there, but it's not the only thing playing in the background. That makes sense. What would it take for you to be able to hold onto that small moment of not being controlled by the worst-case story – just for the next task, or the next 5 minutes – without expecting it to come back as loudly as before?

Patient: I think I'd need a tiny, concrete anchor: say “that’s my disaster story” out loud, take one slow breath, touch my ID badge or the chart, tick the box, and set a five-minute timer so I only have to hold it that long. Maybe a coworker could give a quick nod or there could be a sticky note on the med list that says “one task,” so it feels less like everything depends on me. I don’t expect it to stop the story forever — I can already hear it plotting how it’ll come back louder after the timer — but I could try that for the next task.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: You're thinking of using a small, concrete anchor – like the timer, the sticky note, or your coworker's nod – to help you hold onto that moment of not being controlled by the worst-case story, just for the next task. That sounds like a really useful way to make progress, even if you don't expect it to solve everything. What's one small step you can take in the next 5 minutes to try that tiny anchor – say the words, take a breath, touch the chart – without worrying about what happens when the timer goes off?

Patient: Okay—I'll say out loud, “that’s my disaster story,” take one slow breath, touch the chart and tick the med box, then set my phone for five minutes. I might even ask a coworker for a quick nod, but I expect the story will only quiet for that short time and then come back louder—still, I'll try that step now.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: You're committing to taking that small step, even though you expect the story to come back. That takes a lot of courage. As you do that step, notice what happens when you let go of the need to control everything – not just the story, but the outcome of this moment. What shows up for you, even if it's just for a tiny second?

Patient: For a split second the yelling dulls and there's this small hollow in my chest where my hands actually steady enough to finish the med check. It feels fragile and temporary — like a pause before the rest of the script lines up to roar back.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: The pause is small, but it's there – that hollow in your chest where your hands steadied. That might be worth noticing, even if it feels fragile and temporary. What if, instead of trying to make that pause last forever, you just noticed it *while* you're still doing the med check – even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: It takes so much just to notice—there's that tiny steadying in my hands, and my head immediately finishes the script: I let myself feel okay for a second, get sloppy, someone notices, I'm reported, I lose my license. I'll try to hold onto that little pause while I finish the med check, even though I already expect the story to come roaring back.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: You're making space for that pause to be there, even when the script starts running again. That takes a lot of kindness towards yourself. What happens if you could hold onto that pause for just one more beat – not because you think it'll change the story, but because it might give you a tiny bit of clarity about what matters most to you right now?

Patient: If I hold it one more beat, I can barely see that what actually matters to me is doing right by the patients — not proving I'm perfect, just following the steps. Of course the disaster voice immediately screams that feeling will make me slip up and lose everything, and keeping that fight going is... wearing. I'll try to hold the beat — can you remind me to notice that tiny clarity when it shows up?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: When you notice that tiny clarity – "doing right by the patients" – before the disaster voice shows up, what would it be like to hold onto it just for a moment, even if it feels small?

Patient: Like a thin thread — it gives me just enough purpose to steady my hands and focus on the next step. Of course my brain instantly finishes the movie: that calm fools me into being careless, I miss something, someone notices, I lose my license and everything falls apart. I'll try to hold that thread for a beat — can you check in and ask me what I noticed afterward?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: You're holding onto that thread for just a beat – not to change the story, but to see what happens when you do. What happened to the disaster voice after you held onto that thread for that tiny moment?

Patient: It went from a full-on movie to background static — enough for me to finish the med and feel my hands steady for that moment. But the voice is already whispering that it'll come back louder later and I don't trust it, so can you ask me what I noticed about that steadiness?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Noticing what's there when you let go of the need to control the disaster voice. What was it about that steadiness – holding your hands, focusing on the next step – that felt most important to you in that moment?

Patient: It made me realize I actually care about doing right by the patients, not about being flawless — that felt like the important bit. I'm not sure I follow how just noticing that helps much, though; my head immediately finishes the disaster — I steady, then I get careless, someone notices, I'm reported, I lose my license. Can you ask me again what I noticed so I can try to hold onto it a bit longer?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: Let's try again. Noticing what's there when you notice that "I care about doing right by the patients" – not about being flawless. What happens when you try to notice that *before* the disaster voice shows up, not because you think it'll change the story, but because it might give you a tiny bit of clarity?

Patient: I'm trying, but it just slides into this hot shame and I get confused—like I'm not sure how noticing is supposed to help. For a breath I can feel that I actually care and my hands steady, and then the disaster voice screams that noticing will make me careless, someone will notice, I'll be reported and lose everything. Can you ask me again what I noticed so I can try to keep that thread for a beat?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame is really tight. What would it be like to notice that shame, even as it shows up, *while* you're trying to hold onto that thread of caring about doing right by the patients? Not to change it, but to see what happens when you notice it right there – with your hands steady, and the disaster voice screaming.

Patient: It feels like a hot weight in my chest and my face goes flush — my hands can still steady on the chart, but the shame starts yelling that this pause is a lie and I'm about to prove I'm useless. Noticing it makes the disaster voice louder, telling me I'll be careless, someone will notice, I'll be reported and lose everything, but I can, for a beat, name the shame out loud and feel the thread hold. Can you ask me what I noticed about my hands and the shame so I can try to keep that tiny steady moment?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: Noticing the shame out loud helped you hold onto the thread for that beat. What happened to your hands while you were holding onto that thread – was it the same steadiness you noticed earlier, or was it something else?

Patient: They steadied — same kind of focused grip as before — but it was trembly, like holding a thin thread that could snap. The shame tightened in my chest and the disaster voice was already whispering that it's a trick, I'll mess up, someone will notice, I'll be reported and lose everything.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: The thread is still there, even if it's trembling. What would it be like to notice the trembling, not to try to fix it, but to see what happens if you keep holding onto the thread *with* the trembling – while the shame and disaster voice are still there?

Patient: My hands hold the chart but they're shaking — a thin, trembling steadiness. The shame digs in and the disaster voice is already finishing the script: I steady, I get sloppy, someone notices, I'm reported, I lose my license. I don't really see how noticing helps, but I'll try — can you ask me again what I noticed so I have to keep paying attention?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting ready to drop the thread. What happens when you notice that the shame and disaster voice are already saying "I'll mess up" – what's the *next* thing you notice, even before you try to stop them?

Patient: My stomach drops and my throat tightens — like I'm bracing to be called out. Before I even try to stop it, my head's already on the next scenes: someone's filing a complaint, there's an investigation, my license is at risk. My hands clamp onto the chart and I go kind of numb, like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop — can you ask me what that numbness feels like?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: The numbness. What does that feel like when you notice it – like you're just waiting for something to happen?

Patient: It's like I'm behind a pane of glass — everything's muted and slow, my body just goes through the motions while my head fast-forwards to the complaint, investigation, lost license. My hands keep working but I feel hollow and disconnected, with this shame simmering underneath that makes the waiting feel absolutely inevitable. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's what the numbness feels like.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It makes sense. You're noticing the numbness as a way to protect yourself from the anxiety of what might happen. When you're holding onto that numbness, what would it take for you to notice the story about the complaint and investigation *while* you're still working with the patient – not because you think it'll change the outcome, but because it matters to you that you're doing right by them?

Patient: Maybe if I quietly said, “that’s the complaint story,” touched the chart, and told myself, “I’m doing right by this patient” as I keep working — like a tiny tether back to the task. It might let me do the job while the story plays in the background, but I can already hear it finishing: someone files a complaint, they investigate, I lose my license. I don’t know if that actually helps — it just feels like something small I could try right now.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: That's a small step you could take now – noticing the story, touching the chart, and telling yourself you're doing right by the patient. What would it be like to try that tiny tether for just one more task – not to change the outcome, but because it matters to you that you're doing right by the patient while the story is playing in the background?

Patient: I can try that — quietly say “that’s the complaint story,” touch the chart, tell myself I’m doing right by this patient, and keep going; my hands might steady but it feels like holding a brittle thread. I can already feel the shame and the movie starting — someone files, they investigate, my license is gone — so it’ll probably only last until the next thing goes wrong; can you check in with me after that task?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: You're committing to trying that small step, even with the fear that it won't last. What happens when you notice that shame and the movie are already showing up, right after the task is done – before you've even had a chance to see if the tiny tether held?

Patient: Right after the task the shame just floods back and the movie's already playing before I can tell if the little tether worked. My chest goes tight, I feel hollow and numb, and the voice is already narrating the complaint, the investigation, my license gone, everyone realizing I'm a fraud — I just wait for that knock. Can you ask me what I noticed about my body or thoughts in that moment so I have to keep paying attention?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: You noticed that the shame and numbness came right back, and the voice started narrating the complaint again – even though you were already feeling that way before the task was done. What happens if you notice that your body feels tight, your chest feels hollow, and your mind is racing *while* you're still waiting for the knock – not because it matters that the story is true, but because it matters that you're still holding onto the tiny tether?

Patient: When I notice the tightness and the racing while I'm still waiting for the knock, it sort of anchors me enough to keep doing the next thing — my breath gets shallow, my throat clamps, my hands hold the chart but they feel like they're gripping a brittle thread. That noticing gives me a tiny bit of distance so I can finish a task, but my mind is already running the complaint-investigation-lose-license movie and I expect the tether to snap any second. Can you ask me what stayed steady in my hands so I have to keep paying attention?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: The fact that your hands *still* held the chart, even though they felt brittle – what mattered to you about that steady grip while the story was running in the background?

Patient: It mattered because that steady grip felt like the only real proof that I’m here for the patients and not just stuck in my head — like I was actually doing the job even while my mind was racing ahead. But of course the voice says it’s temporary, that the grip will fail, I’ll miss something, someone will complain, and everything will collapse. Can you ask me which part of the task felt hardest to keep steady so I have to keep paying attention?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: The part of the task that felt hardest to keep steady – what mattered to you about that moment, even as the voice was saying it would fail?

Patient: The hardest bit was keeping my head on the dose math and the double-check — those tiny precise steps where one slip feels like it would prove I'm a fraud. What mattered was that steadying felt like the only thing showing I actually care and can do the job, even though the disaster voice insists one mistake will lead to a complaint, an investigation, and me losing my license. That makes everything feel brittle and kind of draining — can you ask me what I noticed about my breathing while I was trying to hold that?
