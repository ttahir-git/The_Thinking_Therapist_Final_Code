--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck on this for weeks — I keep getting hit with anger and frustration, especially when anything reminds me of the breakup, and it's spilling into work. I'm a teacher, middle-aged, pretty burned out, and I find myself snapping at colleagues or stewing for hours afterward. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried talking and some strategies before and they didn't work, so how is this supposed to be different?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying the weight of those feelings quite deeply, and it's understandable that you're skeptical about making changes. What's that small part of you that's holding onto the idea that this approach won't work, even though you're willing to try it?

Patient: I guess a part of me thinks it's pointless because I've tried similar things before and they never stuck. I worry that talking or doing exercises won't stop the split-second anger when something reminds me of the breakup — how is that supposed to help when I'm already halfway to snapping? I'm willing to try, but I'm guarded and don't want to get my hopes up.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That guardedness makes sense. It's like you're standing on the edge of trying something new, but you're not sure if you'll be able to let go of the "what-ifs" when it matters most.

Patient: Maybe — I can see that. But even if I accept that, the anger hits so fast I don't have time to "choose" anything; last week a parent asked about my ex and I snapped before I even registered it, then spent the rest of the day seething. How is talking about it or trying small exercises supposed to help when I'm already halfway to losing it? I want concrete, practical steps I can actually use in the moment, not vague encouragement — what do you suggest?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: When that anger hits fast, it's like a storm warning – you feel like you're drowning. What if, instead of trying to stop the storm, you could make room for it to pass?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Making room for it sounds nice in theory but when I’m slammed with anger in front of a parent or colleague I don’t have time to “make room.” My body goes hot, my jaw clenches, my voice shoots up, and I feel like I have to say something immediately — then I spend the rest of the day replaying it. I’ve tried breathing and counting and it doesn’t stop that first reflex; if you’re going to suggest something, give me one concrete thing I can do in that split second that actually reduces the urge to snap.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: In that moment, what happens when you say to yourself, "I'm already here, even when I'm about to snap – I'm still the person who cares about this parent, about teaching, about showing up"?

Patient: It kind of helps afterward, like when I'm replaying it later and feel awful, that thought can pull me back a bit — but not in the moment. In those three or four seconds my body's already hijacked: jaw clenches, pulse spikes, words barreling out. Saying "I'm still the person who cares" feels like whispering into a hurricane. If you're going to ask me to try something, give me one single, concrete physical thing I can do right then that won't make me look ridiculous or escalate things.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: When you feel that storm hitting, what happens if you just notice the sensation of your jaw clenched, without trying to change it – just noticing it, like a small rock under your hand?

Patient: Noticing it just makes me more aware afterward, not in the moment — I'm already talking by the time I realize my jaw's tight. How is that supposed to help when I'm face-to-face and words are coming out? If noticing helps later, fine, but give me one concrete, subtle physical thing I can do in that split second that won't make me look like I'm losing it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: What if, in those three seconds, you simply *pause* – just a tiny pause – between the words and the action, before speaking?

Patient: A tiny pause sounds okay in theory, but in those moments I'm already halfway out the door — how is that supposed to happen? My brain either blanks or I blurt something worse, and I'm worried a pause will just look weird or make people think I'm being rude. If you want me to try it, give me one inconspicuous thing I can do in that split second — a phrase to think or a tiny physical move — and tell me how to practice it so it actually works under stress.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: When you feel that "halfway out the door" – the words already on your lips – what if you make the tiny move of *slightly* letting your breath out – just a tiny, tiny bit – while still speaking?

Patient: Okay—maybe that's slightly more practical than a pause, but I'm still skeptical: how is a tiny exhale while speaking actually going to stop the reflex to lash out? If you're serious, give me one exact thing to do in that split second—like inhale silently, let out a barely-audible exhale while thinking the word "steady," or a specific two-syllable phrase I can use—something discreet I can rehearse. And tell me exactly how to practice it so it becomes automatic under real stress, because I'm tired of rehearsing stuff that falls apart when it counts.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: What if, in that exact moment, you silently *let your tongue touch the roof of your mouth* – just a tiny, brief touch – while still speaking, and think the word "steady"?

Patient: Okay—touching the roof of my mouth and thinking "steady" sounds small enough to be discreet, but I'm skeptical: how is that supposed to actually stop the reflex when my jaw's already clenched? Tell me exactly how to practice it so it becomes automatic — short drills between classes, mirror practice, or what, and how many reps? Also, will that even work if my mouth's already moving and my heart's racing? I've tried tiny tricks before and they vanish under stress, so be concrete.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: When your jaw's clenched and words are on your lips, what if you *only* focus on making that tiny touch with the roof of your mouth – not the words, not the stress, just the touch – and then immediately let it go?

Patient: Okay — that actually sounds small enough to try, but I'm skeptical: how is a tiny tongue touch supposed to interrupt the automatic lashing out? Tell me the exact micro-steps I should rehearse (e.g., touch roof for one second, think "steady," release), how often to practice so it becomes automatic (between classes? how many reps?), and what to do if my mouth's already moving — can I do it mid-sentence without sounding weird or making things worse?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Here's what I want you to try:

Find a mirror where you can sit comfortably with your mouth closed. For 30 seconds, notice what happens when you feel that jaw clenched and words are on your lips. Just observe it – don't try to change it.

Now, make a tiny habit: touch the roof of your mouth with your tongue for exactly 1 second – just that long – as soon as you feel that clenched jaw. Not before, not after, but exactly *during* the moment your jaw starts to tense.

As soon as you touch the roof of your mouth, think the word "steady" for just 1 second – no more, no less.

Release your tongue from the roof of your mouth, and then *just sit with that feeling* for another second.

Repeat this sequence 10 times, 3 times a row, without stopping. Just focus on making that tiny touch and thinking "steady" as your jaw starts to tense.

When you feel ready, we can practice it in a real situation – like during a class – but for now, let's focus on making that tiny habit happen in the mirror.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the mirror drill since it’s specific, but I’m skeptical it’ll hold up in a real interaction. How am I supposed to reliably notice the exact moment my jaw starts to tense so I don’t miss it, and if my mouth’s already moving can I realistically do the tongue touch mid-sentence without interrupting speech or sounding odd? I’ll do the 10x3 set between classes and report back, but if it flakes under pressure, what’s the next concrete move?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Let's break down the mirror drill further.

To notice the exact moment your jaw starts to tense, try this:

*   When you feel the familiar sensation of your jaw clenching, take a tiny pause – just 1 second – before making the tongue touch.
*   As you pause, focus on the sensation of the tension in your jaw. It might feel like a tiny "band" or a "heavy" feeling.
*   When you notice that sensation, make the tiny touch with your tongue and think the word "steady."

Regarding doing the tongue touch mid-sentence, here's what to try:

*   When you feel your jaw starting to tense while speaking, make the tiny touch with your tongue for exactly 1 second.
*   As soon as you touch the roof of your mouth, think the word "steady" for just 1 second.
*   Release your tongue from the roof of your mouth, and then *just keep speaking*.

Here's what to do if it feels like you're missing the moment or interrupting yourself:

*   Don't worry about making the tongue touch perfectly – just focus on noticing the sensation of your jaw tensing.
*   If you feel like you're interrupting yourself, try making the tiny touch anyway, even if it feels awkward. The goal is to make the habit show up, not to speak perfectly.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the mirror drill, but I’m skeptical it’ll hold up under real pressure. A few practical things I need you to be concrete about before I start:

1) How do I reliably catch that exact split-second in real interactions? Do you want me to pause briefly before responding — because in front of a parent that feels risky.  
2) If I touch the roof of my mouth while speaking, will it change my pronunciation or make me sound odd? Is the 1-second rule strict or can it be a half-second so it’s less noticeable?  
3) How long should I practice before we decide whether it’s working — a week, two weeks? What exact things should I track (number of snaps, intensity on a 1–10 scale, how long I stew afterward)?  
4) If it fails in a high-stakes moment, what’s an immediate repair line I can use that won’t escalate things — something short, neutral, and discreet?  
5) And if it just flat-out flakes under stress, what’s the next concrete move you’d recommend?

I’ll do the 10x3 mirror sets between classes this week and keep quick notes, but I want clear answers to those questions so I’m not wasting time on something that disappears when it matters.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Let's address your concerns:

1.  Catching that exact split-second in real interactions: You don't need to pause before responding. Instead, focus on making the tiny touch while your jaw starts to tense, even if it feels awkward. This habit can help you notice the sensation without disrupting the interaction.
2.  Impact on pronunciation: The 1-second rule is not strict. If you feel like you're getting the touch in, but it's still a bit noticeable, try to release the tension and keep speaking. You can always try to make the touch again in the next moment.
3.  Tracking progress: For the next 2 weeks, track the following:
    *   Number of snaps per interaction
    *   Intensity of the tension on a 1-10 scale
    *   Time spent stewing afterward
4.  Immediate repair line: If the habit fails in a high-stakes moment, try using a neutral phrase like "I'm really focused on listening right now. Can we talk about \[specific topic]?" This helps shift the focus away from the tension and keeps the conversation going.
5.  Next concrete move: If the habit still doesn't show up under stress, try this:

*   Before the high-stakes interaction, take 30 seconds to notice your physical sensations (like the knot in your stomach) and acknowledge them. This helps you stay present without getting caught up in the tension.
*   When you feel the knot, make the tiny touch with your tongue and think the word "steady" for just a second. This might help you stay connected to your breath and respond more calmly.

Patient: Alright — I’ll give the mirror sets a shot, but I'm still doubtful it’ll hold up when I’m actually triggered. Before I start, can we do a quick rehearsal now? Give me a realistic prompt (like a parent asking about my ex) and I’ll try the tongue touch mid-response so I can feel how it works. Also give me one exact, short repair line I can use if I do snap — something neutral and six words or fewer — and tell me if it’s acceptable to excuse myself for 30 seconds as a fallback instead of trying to tough it out.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Let's rehearse a realistic prompt:

A parent asks you about your ex during a conversation about a shared interest. They say, "Hey, I heard you used to date someone who loves hiking. What was that like?"

During the response, try to make the tiny touch with your tongue and think the word "steady" for just 1 second, even if it feels awkward.

If you snap, here's a short repair line:

"I'm really focused on what you're saying."

This line helps shift the focus back to the conversation and doesn't escalate the tension.

As for excusing yourself for 30 seconds, that's a great fallback. If you feel yourself about to snap, you can say, "Excuse me for just a second, I need to get a glass of water." This gives you a brief moment to collect yourself before responding.

Patient: Okay — I tried it in my head with that prompt. I touched the roof of my mouth for a second and thought “steady.” It was small and didn’t make me sound weird, and it dinged the edge off the heat, but I still felt the urge to snap and a couple of words almost escaped. The repair line seems fine and the water excuse is a good fallback, but I’m frustrated — I keep doing drills that only sorta work in practice. So what’s the next concrete tweak if this only reduces the spike instead of stopping it, and how do I train so it actually becomes automatic when I’m really triggered?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the drills are helping to reduce the spike, but not eliminate it entirely. That's a great insight.

Here's a potential next concrete tweak:

*   Instead of focusing solely on making the tiny touch and thinking "steady," try to notice what happens when you **don't** make the touch. What sensations do you notice in your jaw or body when you're about to snap? What thoughts come up? When you notice those things, try to **pause** for just 1 second before responding. This pause might help you connect with what's driving the urge to snap, and you might find that you can respond more thoughtfully as a result.

As for training it to become automatic, here's a suggestion:

*   When you notice the urge to snap, try to **reframe** the thought: "I'm having trouble staying calm right now. That's okay. It's not a failure to feel this way." Instead of trying to push the thought away, try to **lean into** it. What would it take for you to notice the thought without getting caught up in it?

Patient: Okay — I hear what you’re saying, but I’m skeptical again: leaning into the feeling and pausing sounds like it could just give me more time to spiral. How is that supposed to help when my mind’s already shouting and my body’s hijacked? Be concrete — give me one exact thought to say to myself in that one-second pause, and a short rehearsal routine (when, how many reps, and for how long) so this doesn’t just vanish under pressure. Also tell me whether I should try combining the tongue touch with the one-second pause or pick one technique to focus on first.


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: I get why you're skeptical. Here's a more concrete suggestion:

**One-second pause:** When you notice the urge to snap, try saying to yourself:

*   "Notice the thought. Just notice it."

This thought helps you **acknowledge** the thought without getting caught up in it. It's like taking a small step back from the storm.

**Rehearsal routine:**

*   Practice this 1-second pause 3 times a day, for 1 week.
*   Do it during your morning meditation or right before a big task.
*   Try to notice your thoughts and physical sensations **before** you respond. This helps you stay present and focused.

**Tongue touch vs. pause:** You can try both techniques, but focus on one at a time for now. If you feel like the tongue touch is working for you, try pausing for just 1 second before responding. If you find that pausing is more helpful, focus on that instead.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the one-second phrase and the tongue touch, but I’m skeptical and I just got hit with this wave of shame that makes me doubt I can pull any of this off. A few concrete questions before I start so I’m not just rehearsing air:

1) For the 3x/day practice, do you want 1 single 1-second pause each time, or a set of repeats (like the mirror drill 10x3)? Be exact — reps, timing, and where in my day.  
2) If I focus on one thing first, you recommend which: tongue touch for a week, then add the pause? Or vice versa?  
3) If I miss the split-second in a real interaction, is the water excuse the primary fallback, or should I try the repair line first? Which order actually reduces fallout fastest?  
4) If both techniques “flake” under real stress after a week, what’s the next concrete move — not theory, an exact micro-routine I can do in the moment or immediately afterwards to limit damage and calm down?

I’ll commit to trying something, but I need those specifics so it’s not another half-baked exercise that disappears when I’m actually triggered. Can we map that out now?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: Here are the concrete specifics you requested:

1.  **Repetition:** For the 3x/day practice, try doing 10 repetitions of either the tongue touch (10x3) or the 1-second pause (10x3) each time. If you're doing the mirror drill, focus on that first. If you're doing the tongue touch, try adding the 1-second pause afterwards.
2.  **Order:** If you focus on one thing first, I recommend starting with the tongue touch for a week. Then, add the 1-second pause afterwards. This helps you build the habit of noticing the tension in your jaw and responding to it more thoughtfully.
3.  **Fallback:** If you miss the split-second in a real interaction, try the repair line ("I'm really focused on what you're saying.") first. If that doesn't work, you can use the water excuse as a backup. The key is to stay calm and focused, even when things go wrong.
4.  **Next move:** If both techniques "flake" under real stress after a week, try doing a small, quick "body scan" in the moment. This means noticing your physical sensations (like your heart racing or your jaw tensing) and imagining yourself standing in a calm, safe place (like a beach or a forest). You can do this by focusing on your breath, noticing the sensation of your feet on the ground, or imagining a warm light filling your body. This helps you stay present and calm, even when things feel overwhelming.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the tongue-touch-first plan and do the mirror sets tomorrow, but I need a few concrete clarifications before I start because I’m already feeling that familiar shame and doubt that I’ll just fail at this like everything else.

1) Time/rep flexibility: if I only have five minutes between classes, is 5x3 acceptable instead of 10x3, or does that meaningfully undermine habit formation? Be exact.  
2) Quick logging template: is this enough — "Date / Context (class/parent/colleague) / Snaps: # / Intensity avg 1–10 / Stew minutes"? Any other single field to add so I can jot it down fast on my phone?  
3) Voice concern: when I touch the roof of my mouth mid-sentence while projecting to a class, will it change my pronunciation or pitch noticeably? If so, should I shorten the touch to 0.5s and still think “steady,” or keep 1s? Pick one and be definitive.  
4) Switching rules: if after 3 full days of practice I see no drop in snaps, do I switch to the 1-second pause, or add it on day 4? Tell me the exact threshold (e.g., <20% reduction) that means switch sooner.  
5) If I absolutely miss the moment in class and can’t excuse myself, which do I use first afterward — the repair line you gave or a silent micro-body-scan? Which reduces fallout faster in your experience?

I’m doing this because I’m tired of replaying the same failures, but I’m guarded — give me exact answers so I’m not wasting energy on vague steps.


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: Here are the exact answers you requested:

1.  **Time/rep flexibility:** If you only have five minutes between classes, doing 5x3 is better than not doing anything. It's not ideal, but it's still better than not practicing at all. Just make sure you're not rushing through the practice, and you're still focusing on the tongue touch.
2.  **Quick logging template:** Your template is a good start. You might consider adding a field for the "Thoughts" or "Emotions" that came up during the practice. This can help you identify patterns and areas where you might need more support. For example, if you're struggling to focus on the tongue touch, you might notice that your mind is wandering to thoughts about your failures or worries about not being good enough.
3.  **Voice concern:** If you touch the roof of your mouth mid-sentence while projecting to a class, it might change your pronunciation or pitch slightly. However, the key is to focus on the thought "steady" rather than worrying about how your voice sounds. If you're worried about changing your pronunciation, you could try touching the roof of your mouth for just 0.5 seconds and focusing on the thought. This way, you're still practicing the habit without worrying about how it might sound.
4.  **Switching rules:** If you see no drop in snaps after 3 full days of practice, it might be worth adding the 1-second pause on day 4. However, the key is to focus on making progress, not on meeting a specific threshold. Instead of saying "I'll switch if I see a <20% reduction," try saying "I'll keep practicing the tongue touch for 4 days and then we'll reassess." This way, you're focusing on making progress rather than trying to meet a specific standard.
5.  **Switching rules:** If you absolutely miss the moment in class and can't excuse yourself, it's probably better to use the repair line first. The repair line is a quick way to acknowledge the moment and move forward, whereas a silent micro-body-scan might take up more time and energy. By using the repair line, you're focusing on moving forward rather than dwelling on what happened.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try it, but I’m still skeptical and this wave of shame makes me doubt I’ll pull it off. Quick confirmations before I start so I’m not wasting time:

- I’ll do 5x3 if I only have five minutes; better than nothing.  
- I’ll shorten the tongue touch to 0.5s when projecting so my voice doesn’t change, still thinking “steady.”  
- I’ll practice the tongue-touch-only for four days, then add the 1-second pause if I don’t see any improvement.  
- Quick log template I’ll use: Date / Context / Snaps # / Intensity 1–10 / Stew minutes / Repair used (which).  

One more thing — give me a single-sentence pre-class script I can say to myself to prime this (two to six words), and tell me exactly what to do if the repair line fails in front of parents (water excuse immediately, or wait a beat?). I’m doing this, but I’m worn out already — I need clear, usable answers.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: Here are the confirmations and additional suggestions:

1.  **Time/rep flexibility:** Yes, doing 5x3 is better than not doing anything. Just make sure you're not rushing through the practice.
2.  **Shortening the tongue touch:** Yes, shortening the tongue touch to 0.5s while still thinking "steady" should help minimize any impact on your voice.
3.  **Practicing tongue touch only:** Yes, practicing the tongue touch only for four days and then adding the 1-second pause if you don't see any improvement makes sense.
4.  **Quick log template:** Your template looks good. You might consider adding a field for the "Thoughts" or "Emotions" that came up during the practice.
5.  **Pre-class script:** Here's a single-sentence pre-class script you can say to yourself: "I've got this. I can do this one moment at a time."
6.  **Repair line failure:** If the repair line fails in front of parents, try saying the water excuse immediately. If you need a beat, wait for a moment before saying "I need to get a glass of water" and then continue.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 0.5s tongue touch, do 5x3 when pressed and 10x3 when I can, log with that template, and give it four days before adding the pause. I’m already bracing for it to fail — I keep replaying past screw-ups and it makes me doubt this will stick. Quick question: when I use the repair line with parents, should my tone be neutral or slightly apologetic so it doesn't come off as defensive?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: When using the repair line with parents, aim for a neutral tone. Avoid sounding apologetic, as that might make you appear defensive. Instead, focus on sounding calm, clear, and matter-of-fact. Here's an example of how you might phrase the repair line:

"Excuse me, I need to get a glass of water for a second. Can we continue this conversation when I've had a chance to refresh myself?"

By using a neutral tone, you're showing that you're still engaged with the conversation, but you need a moment to collect your thoughts. This can help you avoid escalating the situation and keep the conversation moving forward.

Patient: Alright — I’ll aim for neutral, but I can already feel that sinking shame that I’ll come off cold or defensive. Give me two very short phrases I can use now:

1) A neutral repair line (4–6 words) I can say immediately after snapping.  
2) A one-sentence response to use if a parent pushes back when I say the water excuse.

Also — is it okay to stand and walk out for the water, or should I stay seated and just say it? I’m worn thin, so keep it simple.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Here are two short phrases for you:

1.  "I need a moment to collect myself." (This phrase acknowledges your need for a moment without apologizing or making excuses.)
2.  "I'm still listening. Can we take a break for a second?" (This phrase shows that you're still engaged with the conversation, but you need a moment to recharge.)

As for standing and walking out for the water, it's perfectly okay to do so. If you need to step away for a moment to get a glass of water, it's not necessary to stay seated and explain it. You can simply stand up, say "Excuse me, I need a glass of water," and walk away for a moment. When you return, you can continue the conversation.

Patient: Okay — those phrases feel doable, though I can already feel that knot and the old embarrassment creeping in that makes me doubt they'll land right. Two quick clarifications before I try them for real:

1) If a parent pushes back after I say the water line, give me one short boundary phrase (4–6 words) to end and reschedule.  
2) If a supervisor notices me step away, should I stick with the repair line or use something like "I'll follow up by email"? Which actually looks least defensive?

I’ll try them tomorrow in class, but I’m… not sure how well I’ll hold up.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Here are two quick clarifications:

1.  If a parent pushes back after you say the water line, here's a short boundary phrase to end and reschedule: "I understand your concern. Can we discuss this further when I've had a chance to gather my thoughts?"
2.  If a supervisor notices you step away, it's best to stick with the repair line. Using a phrase like "I'll follow up by email" might come across as evasive or dismissive, which could escalate the situation. By saying "I need a moment to collect myself," you're acknowledging the interruption and setting a clear boundary while still showing that you value the conversation.

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the longer line, but it already feels like too many words when I’m shaky. Give me a 4–6 word boundary phrase I can actually say in the moment, and one short re-entry line for when I come back that won’t sound defensive. I keep feeling that old failure buzzing under everything, and it’s making this all feel heavy.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: Here are a few options for a 4-6 word boundary phrase that you can say in the moment:

*   "That's enough for now."
*   "I need to focus."
*   "Let's take a break."

And here's a short re-entry line that you can use when you come back:

*   "Where were we?"

These phrases are designed to be simple and straightforward, while still conveying your needs and boundaries.

Patient: Okay… those short lines feel doable, but I’m already bracing that they’ll come out either cold or weak. Give me one single 4–6 word boundary phrase that’s firm but not abrupt, and one brief (2–4 word) re-entry line that sounds a bit warmer. Also tell me exactly what tone to use (neutral/calm/soft) and a two-sentence micro-rehearsal routine — how many reps and when — so I can practice without wearing myself out.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: Here are the options:

*   Boundary phrase: "I need to step away now."
*   Re-entry line: "Can we try that again?"

Tone: Use a neutral tone that's calm and soft, without any hint of coldness or weakness.

Micro-rehearsal routine:

*   Reps: 5
*   When: Right before class tomorrow

Patient: Okay — I’ll do the 5 reps before class and say the lines out loud so they’re not weird when I actually use them. But honestly, how is repeating this different from all the drills that evaporated when I was stressed? One practical thing: do you want the rehearsal spoken at regular volume or just under my breath, and if I’m already shaky can I cut to 3 reps instead of 5 so I don’t psych myself out? I keep getting hit with that old wave of shame and it’s making this feel fragile.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: Repeating the rehearsed phrases out loud at regular volume can help you build confidence and familiarity with the words. However, if you're already feeling shaky, it might be helpful to start with just whispering the phrases to yourself or practicing them in your mind while taking slow, deep breaths. You can also try repeating the phrases while doing a gentle physical activity, like tapping your feet or stretching your hands.

Patient: Alright — I’ll try starting gentler: 3 whisper reps before class and work up to 5 at regular volume when it feels okay. I’ll do the tongue-touch mirror sets between classes (5x3 when rushed, 10x3 when I can) and use the 0.5s touch with “steady.” 

One quick thing I need clear: when rehearsing, should I pair the tongue touch with the pre-class script ("I've got this...") or keep the touch paired only with the word "steady"? I’m worn out and this shame keeps buzzing, so I don’t want to mix things up and make it worse.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: When rehearsing, you can pair the tongue touch with the word "steady" only. This way, you can focus on making the tongue touch a consistent habit, and not add another thing to worry about. If you feel like pairing the tongue touch with the pre-class script is making it worse, try starting with just the tongue touch and the word "steady" and see how it feels.

Patient: Alright — I’ll stick with the 0.5s touch and only “steady.” I’m worn out and not confident this will hold up, so be blunt: if after four days it still flakes in class, what’s the single immediate micro-step I should do in the moment to stop escalation (repair line or water first?), and exactly what short phrase should I say when I walk away so I don’t sound defensive? I need one thing I can actually rely on when I go blank.
