--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been using procrastination a lot to numb stuff since I started a demanding school program, and it's been the main way I cope with this grief. I'm unemployed right now, so I tell myself I have time, but then days slip away and I get more behind. I don't know—I guess I'm worried this is becoming the default and I can't keep doing it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the sense of "I have time" when you're unemployed has become a kind of illusion, isn't that right? Even though it feels like there's no actual deadline, the pressure to catch up still feels overwhelming. What matters most to you about tackling this grief, even if it feels hard?

Patient: I don't know— I guess what matters is being able to get through my days without everything feeling like a huge weight. Maybe also not wanting the grief to be the excuse I use to ruin this program or let down people who count on me.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Being able to show up for the program and others without that weight feels really important to you. When you notice that weight showing up, what's the first thing you'd like to notice about it instead of letting it define your day?

Patient: I don't know—I guess I'd want to notice the physical stuff first, like my chest getting tight or that sudden urge to scroll instead of starting work. Maybe noticing it's temporary, not the whole day, could help. I'm not great at staying with that, though.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: Noticing the physical sensations can be a small step into connection, even if it feels fleeting. What would it take for you to be willing to stay with noticing that tightness for just 30 seconds, like taking one breath while you're waiting for your coffee to start?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd need something really concrete, like setting a 30‑second timer on my phone and a simple cue: inhale, count to four, exhale. But part of me worries that if I stop I'll get stuck crying or spiral, so maybe starting with 10 seconds feels safer and then I could try to build up. I'm not sure I can actually do it right now, though — it just feels kind of scary.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Setting a timer and having a clear cue can help you show up to that 30 seconds, even if it's scary. If you're worried about spiraling, what would it mean to you to *not* spiral when you're sitting there noticing that tightness – what small things could you do or think about while that happens, even if it's hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess small concrete things might help, like a 10‑second breathing timer, doing a quick 5‑4‑3‑2‑1 grounding (name things you can see/hear/touch), or splashing cold water on my face. Maybe also a tiny next step I can commit to, like opening a doc for two minutes or texting one person “I’m not great right now,” so I feel less alone. But honestly, I’m not sure I can do any of that in the moment — it still feels like it could turn into crying or getting stuck.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having a tiny next step that matters to you feels like a lifeline, even if it's hard to commit to it in the moment. What if, instead of trying to do all those things at once, you just *allowed* yourself to be there with that thought – "I'm not sure I can do any of that in the moment" – without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could try letting that thought sit instead of trying to fix it, but it feels risky. I'm scared that if I actually stop I'll start crying and won't be able to get back to work. Maybe doing the 10‑second timer thing feels like a safer way to "allow" it without getting stuck, but I'm not sure I can do it right this minute.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having that thought "I'm scared that if I stop I'll start crying" is really showing up for you. What if, right now, you could just notice that thought without trying to fix it – without worrying about what might happen next? Noticing it as a thought, not as a rule for your whole life.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try to notice it as just a thought, but it feels really risky, like if I lean into it I'll lose control and can't get back to work. Maybe starting with that 10‑second timer and naming the thought out loud ("I'm scared I'll cry") feels doable, but I'm not sure I can actually do it right now. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed right now. Taking a deep breath with you – what would it take for you to feel even a tiny bit smaller in that overwhelm, so you could maybe notice what's possible in that 10-second timer?

Patient: I don't know — I guess a really tiny, concrete anchor would help, like a 10‑second timer plus a pre-decided next step (open a doc for two minutes or do a 5‑4‑3 grounding). Maybe if you checked in right after that timer it would feel safer, but I'm still scared it'll turn into crying or getting stuck. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Let's slow down even further. What would it mean to you to take that tiny step with the timer, not to "fix" the feeling, but just to show up with it for those 10 seconds? Not to change it, but to notice it as you're doing it.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would mean proving to myself I can sit with it for a tiny bit without the whole day collapsing. Maybe it's about reclaiming a little control so grief doesn't get to be the default excuse. I'm feeling shaky saying that, but I could try the 10‑second timer now if you check in with me right after.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Checking in with you right after the timer sounds like a good way to anchor the small step. *no expectations, just noticing*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is you checking in supposed to help with the spiraling part? I guess it might make it feel less alone if you actually ask me right after, so... if you're willing to check in, I can try the 10‑second timer now, but I'm nervous it'll just make me cry.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: I can check in with you in a way that feels safe for you. If you're willing, I can ask you a question right after the timer: "What's the smallest thing that matters to you about being able to show up with this feeling – without it spiraling?"

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how your check‑in will stop the spiraling, but I guess having you ask me right after might make it feel less alone. Okay, I'll try the 10‑second timer now if you check in after — I'm nervous it could make me cry.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: *no expectations, just noticing*

Patient: Okay… I’ll try it. I’m starting the 10‑second timer now — I don’t know, I guess I’ll just sit with the tightness and wait for your question. I’m really nervous it’ll make me cry, so please check in right after.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: *I'm not here to fix it, just to show up with you*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how does just being here stop the spiral? I guess it might help me feel less alone, though. My chest is really tight and I'm nervous I'll cry, but okay—ask me "What's the smallest thing that matters to you..." right after the timer.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: *I'm here to notice the space between the tightness and the question*

Patient: I don't know — I guess the smallest thing that matters is being able to open a doc and type one sentence or leave it there for two minutes without immediately scrolling away. I'm not sure I follow how noticing the space stops the spiral, but maybe it makes the urge less automatic. I'm feeling shaky saying that, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *I'm here to notice the space with you, not to fix it*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing the space supposed to stop the spiral? I don't know, I guess it might make me feel less alone, but my chest is really tight and I'm scared if I cry I won't be able to get back to work. Can you just stay with me if that happens and not push me to do anything else? I'm feeling shaky.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: *I'm here to stay with you, exactly as you are, if your chest tightens or you start to cry. No expectations, no pushing – just being present with whatever shows up*

Patient: I don't know — I guess that helps a little. If I start crying, can you just keep asking me one simple thing, like "what's one tiny next step you can do in two minutes?" I’m scared it'll turn into avoiding everything for the rest of the day, so having that concrete anchor might keep me from spiraling.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: *One tiny next step: what's one thing you can do in those two minutes that matters to you, even if it feels small*

Patient: I don't know — I guess the tiny thing is just opening a doc and typing one sentence (or even just the title) for two minutes. I'm nervous it’ll turn into crying or scrolling, so can you check in after and ask me if I typed anything? I'm feeling shaky, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: *I'll check in with you after you open the doc and type something*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is you asking me about it supposed to stop the spiral? I guess... I opened the doc and typed a title, but then I got shaky and didn't add more. Can you check in like you said and ask if I typed anything? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: *I'll just notice that you typed a title, and that's where we are right now*

Patient: I don't know — I guess typing a title is something, but it feels kind of pathetic like I should've done more. My chest's tight and I got shaky and almost started scrolling instead. Can you just stay with me and, like you said, check in if I can add one more word in the next two minutes? I'm really nervous this will turn into avoiding everything, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *I'm here with you, noticing the tightness in your chest and the feeling of "should've done more" – and the thought that you might not be able to add that one more word*

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest's really tight and I keep thinking I should've done more. Okay, set a two‑minute timer and ask me after if I added one more word, but please don't push me — just check in gently. I'm feeling shaky, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *I've got a timer set for 2 minutes – when it goes off, I'll gently ask you if you added that one more word, no pressure*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is a timer supposed to stop me from spiraling? I don't know, I guess I'll try it, but I'm really shaky and scared I'll start crying. Can you please be gentle when you check in, and…can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *I'll be gentle when I check in, noticing that you're really shaky and scared – and we'll slow down even further, just for those 2 minutes*

Patient: I don't know — I guess okay, I'll try the two‑minute timer. I'm not sure I follow how being gentle stops the spiral, but that actually helps a little, so I’ll set it now; please just ask me gently if I added one more word when it goes off. I'm feeling pretty shaky.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *I'll ask you gently when the timer goes off: "What happened when the timer went off – did you add that one more word?"

Patient: I don't know — I guess I managed to add one word: "start." It feels kind of pathetic but also…something. My chest is still tight and I'm shaky, and I almost scrolled away halfway through. Can you stay with me and, like, ask what one tiny next thing I can do for two minutes is? I'm scared this will just turn into avoiding everything, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *Noticing that you added "start" – and that it feels kind of pathetic, but also something*

Patient: I don't know — I guess the tiniest thing is to spend two minutes writing one sentence that expands on "start" (like "Start by writing the opening line about why this matters"). I'm shaky and worried I'll get distracted or cry, so can you check in gently after the two minutes?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *I'll check in gently after the 2 minutes: "What shows up when you're writing that opening line – do you notice anything different about the tightness in your chest?"

Patient: I don't know — I guess when I tried to write that opening line my chest eased a little, like I could actually breathe for a second and a few words came. But I'm still shaky and my eyes feel like they'll well up, and I almost scrolled away twice. Can you just stay with me and gently ask what one tiny next step I can do for two minutes? I'm feeling overwhelmed, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *Noticing that the chest eased a bit when you started writing – and that you're still shaky, but able to focus on the words*

Patient: I don't know — I guess it did help a little; my chest eased and a few words actually came, but I'm still shaky and worried I'll just scroll away. Maybe the next tiny thing is another two minutes to write one more sentence, and can you check in gently after? I'm feeling overwhelmed, so can we slow down a bit.
