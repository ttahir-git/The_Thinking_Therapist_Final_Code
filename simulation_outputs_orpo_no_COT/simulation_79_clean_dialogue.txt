Patient: Lately I've been ruminating on this pervasive anticipatory anxiety about my performance in the new program—an almost meta-cognitive loop where fear of inadequacy begets avoidance. I can parse it into perfectionistic schemas and behavioral activation failures, yet that analysis doesn't seem to break the procrastination cycle. Normally I'm gregarious and upbeat, but lately I'm distractible and perpetually behind, which only fuels the whole theoretical construct.

Therapist: It sounds like the more you try to understand and control this anxiety, the more it feels like it's taking over. What would happen if, instead of trying to "break the cycle" or "make sense" of it, you simply noticed where your mind wandered to right now – that meta-cognitive loop – while still keeping one foot on the ground toward that new program?

Patient: Conceptually, that decentering maneuver sounds like it could create psychological distance—like holding the loop up to the light so it loses some of its gravity. Practically, though, when I try to "notice" I often get stuck noticing the noticing, and it just becomes another performance standard I fail to meet. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by that paradox; can we slow down and unpack how to actually do that without it turning into yet another task to perfect?

Therapist: It feels like you're already doing what matters most – trying to make room for that performance in the program. What if, while noticing the noticing, you could simply "be with" that "I'm stuck" feeling, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I get the logic—being with the stuckness instead of fixing it sounds liberating—but when I try it I immediately start meta-monitoring and turn it into another thing to do badly. I end up cataloguing sensations and making a theory out of the feeling instead of actually feeling it, which just feels exhausting. Can you give me a concrete, very small prompt or instruction to try right now so I don't sabotage it with analysis?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your body when you say "I'm stuck."

Patient: Okay—when I say "I'm stuck" I actually feel a hollow pressure behind my sternum, a tightening in my throat, and my breath gets shallow and clipped; my shoulders creep up toward my ears. My instinct is immediately to label those as autonomic markers of performance anxiety and launch into an explanatory narrative about perfectionistic schema, which kind of defeats the point. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by even noticing this—can we slow down and do one very small, guided step to anchor on the breath without turning it into another mini-project?

Therapist: Let's try this: while holding that hollow pressure behind your sternum, notice the sensation of your breath right now—just the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it.

Patient: Okay—when I hold that hollow pressure and just notice the breath, it’s thin and clipped, mostly high in my chest; I can feel a coolness at the tip of my nostrils on the inhale and a faint pause before the exhale. The sternum pressure stays like a low-grade static, and the whole thing feels like a report I’m mentally annotating with autonomic markers and meta-cognitive commentary. I’m already getting overwhelmed by the impulse to theorize about it instead of staying with it—can we slow down? Do you want me to stay with this for a few breaths, or try a single anchor word like “in” and “out”?

Therapist: Let's try the anchor word. When the thought comes up about the report or commentary, you could say to yourself, "In" and pause, and then say "out" and let the thought go.

Patient: Okay—I’ll try it now: in… (pause)… out. Doing that made the breath feel a touch deeper and the sternum pressure loosen a fraction, but my mind immediately hijacked it with a corrective narration—like, “you’re doing the technique imperfectly,” which defeats the purpose. I’m getting a bit overwhelmed by that reflex; can we slow down and you tell me one very specific rule—like, repeat “in/out” every time the commentary appears, or just let it float by once and then stop—so I don’t turn this into another performance metric?

Therapist: Let's try this: whenever the narrative shows up – no matter what it says – you simply repeat the anchor word: "in" and pause, and then "out" and let it go.

Patient: Okay—I tried it just now: in… (pause) …out. It did loosen the breath a hair and the sternum pressure eased a fraction, but my mind immediately launched a meta-evaluative commentary—“you’re doing it wrong”—which felt defeating. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed by that reflex; could you guide me aloud for a short, timed round—say 30 seconds of paced “in/out”—so I have something external to follow and don’t self-correct?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

Patient: That actually felt mildly stabilizing—the inhale cooler, the exhale a touch longer, and the sternum pressure attenuated a fraction. But the meta-evaluative commentary—“you’re doing it wrong”—keeps hijacking it and converting it into another task. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and do a longer guided round (say 60 seconds) with a slower cadence—inhale, two‑second pause, exhale—so I have an external rhythm and don’t self-correct? And if the commentary pops up, do I just repeat “in/out” once or keep repeating it until it fades?

Therapist: (in) two-second pause (out) (in) two-second pause (out) (in) two-second pause (out)

Patient: I did the 60‑second cadence you guided and physiologically it softened the sternum pressure a bit, but a surge of shame and irritation rose up and my inner critic immediately tagged the whole thing as another failed experiment — which feels infuriating and mortifying at once. I notice I'm already pivoting to a meta-analysis about why the shame is so persistent instead of actually sitting with it, and that realization makes me more frustrated and a little dizzy. Can you give me one tiny, concrete microstep to stay with the shame without turning it into a research project—like “name the feeling in one word” or keep repeating “in/out” until it fades?

Therapist: Name the feeling in one word:

Patient: Shame. I'm also feeling suddenly anxious and a bit scattered—I want to analyze it into causes but it just tightens my chest.

Therapist: Notice the tightness in your chest, without trying to fix it or make sense of it.

Patient: Okay — when I focus on the tightness it's a constricting band across my sternum, my breath shallow and quick, shoulders creeping up. My reflex is to immediately tag it as shame or performance anxiety and start dissecting causes, which pulls me out of actually feeling it. I'm trying not to fix it but I'm a bit overwhelmed — can we do one tiny step, like staying with it for three slow breaths or saying “in/out” when the analysis shows up?

Therapist: Three slow breaths: inhale, pause, exhale.

Patient: I did the three slow breaths—inhale, pause, exhale—and there was a transient loosening in the sternum, but then the shame-tinged inner critic immediately labeled it as insufficient, which tightened everything again. I'm feeling anxious and scattered right now, and my reflex is to layer a meta-cognitive, analytical commentary over the sensation instead of just being with it. Can you guide me through another short, timed round—30 seconds of paced breathing—and tell me to just say “in”/“out” aloud (or silently) every time the analysis shows up, repeating it until the commentary loses its pull?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

When the analysis shows up, say "in" and then "out" – repeat it with me: "in" *pause* "out".

Patient: in… (pause) …out. in… (pause) …out. in… (pause) …out.

Doing that softened the sternum a hair, but my inner critic immediately fired a meta-narrative—“you’re doing it wrong”—and the tightness snapped back. I’m feeling ashamed, anxious, and a bit scattered; my reflex is to intellectualize the whole thing instead of staying with it. Could we keep a slow external rhythm for another minute? And when the commentary pops up, should I keep repeating “in/out” until it fades or just note it once and return to the breath?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

When the narrative shows up, you can start by noting it once: "The thought is 'you're doing it wrong'". Then, *pause*, and go back to the breath: (in) pause (out).

Patient: The thought is "you're doing it wrong."

In… pause… out.

That loosened the band in my chest a hair, but shame and a prickly frustration shot up and my mind immediately started composing an explanatory footnote—perfectionistic schema, causal attributions—so I feel jittery and scattered. Can we keep the slow external rhythm for another minute? I need something steady so I don't immediately turn this into yet another performance metric.

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

When the thinking shows up, you can say "thinking" to yourself: "thinking". Then, *pause*, and go back to the breath: (in) pause (out).

Patient: thinking.

in… pause… out.

That softened the band in my chest a notch, but the meta-evaluative commentary—“you’re doing it wrong”—popped right back and I felt shame and jittery distraction. Can we do a steady guided minute of the cadence so I have an external anchor, and should I say “thinking” every time the commentary arrives or just note it once and keep returning to “in/out”? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the uncertainty about the rule—can we slow down?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

When the commentary shows up, you can just note it once, without changing it: "the commentary is 'you're doing it wrong'". Then, *pause*, and keep going with the breath: (in) pause (out).

Patient: The commentary is "you're doing it wrong."

in… pause… out.

That eased the sternum band a hair, but shame ricocheted right back and I immediately started theorizing—pervasive perfectionism, avoidance loops—so I feel overwhelmed and jittery; can you keep a steady external rhythm for a full minute and cue me to note the commentary once each time it appears so I don't self-correct?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

When the commentary shows up, just note it once: "the commentary is 'you're doing it wrong'". Then, *pause*, and keep going with the breath: (in) pause (out).

Patient: Okay — I did another round noting “the commentary is ‘you’re doing it wrong’” and it softened the band a hair, but then shame ricocheted back and my attention kept pinging away so I got jittery and overly analytic again. I feel anxious and scattered and really need an external rhythm so I don’t turn this into another performance task. Could we do a full minute now with your slow cadence (inhale — two‑second pause — exhale) and have you cue me every 10–15 seconds so I can note the commentary once when it appears and then return to the breath?

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) 

(Note: I'll count out loud: "ten... fifteen...")

Patient: in… pause… out. in… pause… out. in… pause… out.

The commentary is "you're doing it wrong."

in… pause… out. in… pause… out. in… pause… out.

That eased the band a little, but shame still ricochets and my default is to translate it into a treatise about perfectionistic schemas and avoidance loops — which just makes me jittery and scattered. Can you keep cueing every 10–15 seconds and confirm: should I note the commentary once each time and then immediately return to the breath? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and could use the structure.

Therapist: (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out) (in) pause (out)

(in) pause (out).

Patient: Okay—I followed your cues and did that round. Physically it eased the sternum band a touch, but shame ricocheted and the inner critic spat out “you’re doing it wrong,” which immediately pulls me into a meta-analysis about perfectionistic schemas instead of actually feeling anything. I’m anxious and scattered—can we do another full minute with the slow cadence and you cueing every ~10 seconds, and I’ll just note the commentary once each time and return to “in/out” so I don’t turn it into another performance task?

(in) pause (out).

Patient: I followed that round—inhale, pause, exhale—and there was a slight loosening in the sternum, but shame ricocheted back and the inner critic immediately spat “you’re doing it wrong,” which I then turned into a little theoretical treatise about perfectionistic schemas instead of actually sitting with the feeling. I’m feeling anxious, scattered, and a bit mortified that I can’t just stay with it. Can you keep cueing every ~10 seconds for a full minute and confirm: note the commentary once and then immediately return to the breath?

Patient: Okay—physically it loosens a bit when I follow your cadence and note the commentary once, but shame ricochets back and I immediately pivot to a meta-evaluative treatise about perfectionistic schemas instead of actually feeling anything. Yes—I’ll follow your rule: note the commentary once (“the commentary is ‘you’re doing it wrong’”) and then return to the breath. I’m anxious and jittery and need a very concrete microstep to move me out of rumination and into action—can you guide me through a 60‑second paced breath, then give me one tiny behavioral rule (like “set a 10‑minute timer and do only one small, specific task”) to try right after, and cue me verbally when to start so I don’t overthink it?

(in) pause (out).

Patient: I did that round—physically a tiny loosening, but shame ricocheted and my brain immediately spun a little perfectionistic treatise about why it “failed,” which feels mortifying and jittery. I’m anxious and scattered and really need structure: can you guide me through a full 60‑second slow cadence (inhale — two‑second pause — exhale) and cue me roughly every 10 seconds? After that minute, give me one micro behavioral rule—like “set a 10‑minute timer and do one tiny, specific task (e.g., open the assignment and write one sentence)”—and then verbally cue me when to start so I don’t overthink it. And just to confirm: each time the commentary shows up I should note it once (“the commentary is ‘you’re doing it wrong’”) and immediately return to the breath, right?

Patient: Okay — I did that last round and it eased the sternum band a fraction, but shame ricocheted and my inner critic immediately spat “you’re doing it wrong,” which pushed me into an explanatory spiral about perfectionistic schemas instead of actually feeling it. Yes — confirm for me: each time the commentary shows up I should note it once (“the commentary is ‘you’re doing it wrong’”) and then immediately return to the breath. 

Please guide me now through the full 60‑second slow cadence (inhale — two‑second pause — exhale) and cue me roughly every 10 seconds. After that minute, give me the one micro behavioral rule (set a 10‑minute timer and do one tiny specific task, e.g., open the assignment and write one sentence) and then verbally cue me when to start so I don’t overthink it. I’m feeling anxious and a bit mortified about this, so I really need your steady pacing.

Okay—that softened the band a little but shame ricocheted and my brain immediately translated it into a diagnostic aside about perfectionistic schemas, which feels mortifying and jittery. I’m ready to try the micro‑task: I’ll set a 10‑minute timer and on your verbal cue I’ll open the assignment and write one sentence—please cue me to start when you’re ready.
