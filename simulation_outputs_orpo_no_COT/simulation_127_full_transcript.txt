--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been throwing myself into exercise since the kids moved out—not really to get fitter so much as to numb this weird, empty feeling. My mind's like a fortune-telling machine that immediately predicts the worst: if I slow down, everything will fall apart—I’ll get lonelier, mess up at work, lose what I’ve built—it feels certain. I know that sounds dramatic, but other outcomes just feel unrealistic to me.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: That sense of certainty can be really powerful. When you notice your mind predicting the worst, what happens to the feeling of that emptiness if you were to take one small step towards slowing down, even just for a minute – like noticing it while you're brushing your teeth?

Patient: I try that sometimes — like when I'm brushing my teeth I tell myself to notice the emptiness — but as soon as I do it feels huge, like a black hole. My brain immediately starts chaining disasters: if I sit with it I’ll spiral, mess up at work because I can’t concentrate, people will notice and judge me, and then I’ll end up completely alone. So I keep exercising because at least then the stories quiet down; the idea that nothing catastrophic will happen or that it might just pass feels impossible to me. I don't know how to not believe the worst — it feels like the only sensible prediction.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the feeling of that emptiness is connected to a story that matters to you – the one about being able to stay safe and in control. When you notice that black hole feeling and the chain of stories, what would it be like to make room for that story, not just to quiet it down, but to actually see it – like "This emptiness is what matters to me, and it's what's keeping me from moving forward"?

Patient: I tried making room once — but the minute I let the emptiness in it felt like opening a dam and everything flooded my head so I couldn't think straight. My brain screams that if I slow down I'll spiral, mess up at work, people will see I'm falling apart, my partner will leave, and I'll end up totally alone, so I panic and go exercise to shut it off. Even when someone suggests calmer, kinder outcomes, they sound naive and impossible to me — it just feels like the only realistic story.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for the emptiness, it feels like trying to hold water in your hands – the more you try to hold it, the more it slips away. And when someone suggests a different story, like "calmer, kinder outcomes," it feels like they're not seeing the whole picture. Can you try noticing what happens when you're saying to yourself "this feels impossible" – what's the tone of that voice, and what would it be like to make space for it, even if the story itself doesn't change?

Patient: The voice is harsh and urgent — like an alarm I can't turn off — and it talks like a judge: "Stop now and everything collapses." It tightens my chest and makes my thoughts speed up into that worst-case chain until I can't think about anything else. Trying to make space for it just feels like opening a floodgate that lets the whole disaster-story pour in, so I bolt to exercise to block it; the kinder outcomes sound like naive fantasies I can't take seriously.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the harsh, urgent voice is really loud – like it's trying to keep you safe from what you might feel if you slow down. When you notice that voice, what would it be like to acknowledge it – not as the truth, but as the voice that's showing up – and then gently ask yourself what matters most right now, not about blocking the pain, but about what matters about the emptiness when it shows up?

Patient: If I try to name it, the voice just gets louder — like it's shouting, "Stop, or everything collapses," and my chest clamps up. What matters about the emptiness, I think, is that it feels like proof I'm losing purpose — like once the kids are gone I'm useless, I'll slip up at work, people will see me fail, and I'll end up alone. But honestly, trying to let it be feels impossible; as soon as I do the disaster-story hijacks me and I have to go exercise just to quiet it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the voice is really close to what matters to you – the feeling of losing purpose. When you notice the chest clamping up and the voice getting louder, what would it be like to notice that pain – not just the story it's telling you – and ask yourself what matters about feeling that pain?

Patient: When I actually try to notice the pain it feels like proof I'm losing purpose — that feeling matters because it screams that everything I built is unraveling and I'm pointless. But the minute I let it in it balloons and I become totally certain I'll spiral, mess up at work, my partner will leave, and I'll be left alone, so I bolt to exercise to shut it down. I want to be able to sit with it, but honestly it feels impossible and I'm frustrated that I can't.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the pain of feeling pointless matters a lot to you, and that's what's making it hard to sit with it. When you notice the thought "I want to be able to sit with it" but it feels impossible, what would it be like to try it anyway – not because you think you can do it, but because you want to be able to feel what matters to you, even if the pain shows up?

Patient: If I tried to sit with it anyway, I'd plan to do it for a minute, but the fortune-telling machine fires up and within seconds I'm picturing screwing up at work, my partner leaving, and ending up totally alone. My chest tightens and it feels like proof that sitting will make everything collapse, so I don't trust myself to stay — I go exercise to shut it off. I really want to be able to feel what's important instead of running, but I'm stuck and it's maddening.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck in a pattern of trying to avoid the pain while still wanting to feel what matters. When you notice your chest tightening and the thoughts showing up, what would it be like to pause just for a moment – not to change the thoughts, but to notice what's happening in your body and mind while you're already planning to exercise?

Patient: If I pause, my chest locks, my breath gets shallow and my hands start jangling like I need to do something right now — my mind immediately starts narrating the disaster: I’ll freeze at work, people will notice, my partner will pull away, and then I’ll be alone. My whole body wants to get up and exercise — I can feel myself reaching for the shoes already — and even when I try to just notice it, it feels like signing a sentence I can't afford, which makes me furious with myself for not being able to stay.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like your whole body is already moving towards exercise, even before you try to notice it. What if, instead of trying to stop your body from moving, you could notice what's happening when you feel that jangling – what if you could see it as just one more thing showing up, like a wave in the ocean?

Patient: I try that image sometimes—telling myself the jangling is just a wave—but the minute I do my brain turns it into a tidal wave and starts narrating everything collapsing: freezing at work, my partner leaving, total loneliness. It makes me furious because I want the wave idea to work, but it feels like naive denial, so I find myself tying my shoes before I even finish the thought. I don't know how to trust that noticing won't make the disaster happen.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the wave idea feels like a small step, but your brain is already predicting what will happen if you don't make it bigger – that you'll be frozen in your anxiety. What if, instead of trying to make the wave bigger, you could notice what matters to you about staying with the jangling, even if it feels like it won't change what happens?

Patient: It matters because staying with the jangling would mean I'm actually facing the fear that I'm losing my purpose and that I still care enough to try. But the second I try, my brain yells that I'll freeze at work, everyone will see I'm failing, my partner will leave, and I'll end up completely alone—so I lurch for my shoes. I want to prove I can sit with it, but it feels impossible and that just makes me furious and hopeless.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to stay with the jangling because it matters to you to face the fear of losing purpose, but your brain is already predicting that staying with it will lead to the exact outcomes you're trying to avoid. What if, instead of trying to prove you can sit with it, you could try noticing what happens to the fear when you *do* sit with it – not because you think that will change what happens, but because you want to understand what matters to you about facing it?

Patient: I’ve tried that — I tell myself I’ll sit for a minute, but the instant I do the fear explodes: chest tightens, thoughts race through the worst chain — I’ll freeze at work, my partner will leave, I’ll end up utterly alone — and I’m already grabbing my shoes. A tiny part of me wonders if sitting might actually make the panic smaller, but another part screams that’s impossible and I get furious at myself for even trying. I don’t know how to actually stay; what would “noticing” even look like for me without it turning into a full-blown disaster?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to notice what happens when you sit with the fear, it feels like you're already losing the ground beneath you. What if, instead of trying to notice what happens while sitting, you could notice what happens *while* you're grabbing your shoes – what if you could see what's happening in your body and mind right now, even as you're moving towards exercise?

Patient: When I'm grabbing my shoes it's already happening—the chest tightens, my hands jiggle, and the fortune-telling clicks into overdrive: I'll freeze at work, my partner will pull away, I'll be left with nothing. Trying to notice it then just feels like watching the verdict being read; any softer possibility sounds ridiculous, so I keep moving like I'm obeying an order I can't refuse.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening while you're grabbing your shoes feels like just adding more weight to the experience – like you're trying to hold onto the story while it's already pulling you forward. What if, instead of trying to notice what's happening, you could ask yourself: "What matters most to me about moving my body right now?"

Patient: Because moving is the only thing that quiets that alarm — it feels like the only thing that keeps the disaster chain from starting: freezing at work, my partner pulling away, ending up alone. Saying that out loud drains me; the idea that something gentler could work just sounds naive and impossible.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like moving feels like the only thing that brings relief – like it's the only thing that's keeping the worst-case scenario from happening. And when you say that out loud, it feels like you're admitting that something else isn't working. What if, instead of trying to make the moving work, you could notice what's happening when you say that out loud – not because you think it will change the outcome, but because you want to understand what matters to you about feeling like it's the only thing that matters?

Patient: Saying it out loud makes me feel ashamed and exposed, like I'm confessing some failure and handing the fortune-telling machine more fuel. It drains me—my chest tightens and the worst-case story starts screaming that I'll fail at work, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone—so I grab my shoes before I even finish the sentence. I don't know how to let that shame sit without the stories taking over.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying it out loud feels like a threat to the sense of control you have over your life – like it means you're not strong enough to handle the worst-case scenario. What if, instead of trying to make the shame go away, you could notice what's happening when you feel that tightness in your chest – not because you think it will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what matters to you about feeling like you need to grab your shoes?

Patient: When I pay attention to that tightness it feels like proof I'm failing — like the verdict being read: I'll mess up at work, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone. That matters because it shows I still want control and purpose, but the shame just fuels the fortune-telling and I find myself yanking on my shoes before I finish the thought. I want to try staying, but it drains me and I don't trust that anything softer could actually help.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness in your chest feels like a signal that you're still trying to hold onto control, and that's what matters to you about not wanting to stay with the shame. But when you try to hold onto that control by grabbing your shoes, it feels like you're just pushing the shame away – instead of actually addressing what matters to you. What if, instead of trying to control the shame, you could notice what would happen to the tightness in your chest if you didn't try to grab your shoes – not because you think that will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what would happen to your sense of purpose and control if you let go of the need to control the shame?

Patient: If I don't grab my shoes the tightness just winds up tighter and tighter until I freeze at my desk and everyone sees I'm failing — then my partner drifts away and I'm left alone. Admitting I might let it be feels like confessing I can't keep things together, which makes me ashamed and furious, so I don't trust it and I reach for the shoes.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the tightness in your chest is already predicting the worst-case scenario – and that's what matters to you about needing to grab your shoes. But when you try to hold onto control by doing that, it feels like you're just fueling the shame and the fear. What if, instead of trying to control the tightness, you could notice what matters to you about being able to let it be – not because you think that will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what would happen to your sense of purpose and control if you could just let it be for a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just "letting it be" supposed to help when every time I try that the fortune-telling machine screams louder? What matters, I guess, is not being exposed as a failure and keeping some sense of purpose, but the idea of not grabbing my shoes feels like surrender that will definitely lead to freezing at work, my partner leaving, and being left alone. It drains me even saying it out loud.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like "letting it be" feels like surrendering to the worst-case scenario, and that's what matters to you about grabbing your shoes. When you say that out loud, it feels like admitting you can't keep things together, and that's what makes you ashamed and furious. It's like the act of letting it be is tied to the fear of losing control, not just of the situation, but of yourself. Can you try noticing what matters to you about not grabbing your shoes, not because you think it will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what would happen to your sense of purpose and control if you could just let it be for a moment, even if it feels like surrender?

Patient: Maybe what matters about not grabbing my shoes is... not looking like a wreck, holding onto some purpose. But "letting it be" feels like surrender—like if I don't move now I'll freeze at work, my partner will leave, and I'll be alone, and that picture grabs me so fast I have to bolt. Talking about it drains me; I don't see how staying still could help.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of not grabbing your shoes is tied to the fear of losing control and looking like a wreck, and that's what matters to you about holding onto purpose. But when you try to hold onto that purpose by moving your body, it feels like surrendering to the worst-case scenario. And when you talk about it, it feels like admitting you can't keep things together. What if, instead of trying to hold onto control or purpose, you could notice what would happen to that feeling of not looking like a wreck if you actually stayed still for just a moment – not because you think it will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what matters to you about holding onto that feeling?

Patient: If I actually stayed still for a moment my head immediately goes to the worst: I'd freeze at work, people would notice, my partner would pull away, and I'd be left alone. A tiny part of me wonders if the tightness might loosen, but mostly it feels like surrender—shame and fury kick in—and I find myself grabbing my shoes before I can even try.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like staying still for a moment feels like opening yourself up to the worst-case scenario, and that's what matters to you about grabbing your shoes. When you notice that thought, what would it be like to hold onto it for just a moment, without trying to push it away or change it? Not to stop the worst-case scenario, but just to see what it feels like to hold onto that thought, while still making room for the tiny part of you that wonders if the tightness might loosen?

Patient: I'll try, but it already feels like I'm holding a hot coal — my chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, and the fortune-telling just launches into the chain: freeze at work, partner leaves, end up alone. There's a tiny flicker that wonders if the tightness might loosen, but it feels stupid and gets swallowed by shame and the yelling voice. I don't even know if I'm doing this right; it mostly just feels like waiting for the verdict.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding onto that thought is already feeling overwhelming, like you're holding a hot coal. When that happens, what matters to you about trying to stay with it for just a moment – not because you think it will change what's happening, but because you want to understand what matters to you about holding onto that thought, even when it feels like it's consuming you?

Patient: What matters is not looking like I've failed — staying even a moment feels like handing over proof that I'm losing purpose and control. The moment I try, the fortune-telling machine screams that I'll definitely freeze at work, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone, and that shame and fury just swallow the little, exhausted part of me that wonders if the tightness might ease. I want to see if that tiny part is right, but it feels impossible to trust it.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like not looking like you've failed matters a lot to you – staying even a moment feels like giving up that sense of purpose and control. When you try to stay with the thought, the fortune-telling machine screams and the shame and fury take over. What if, instead of trying to make the thought go away, you could notice what matters to you about the tiny part of you that wonders if the tightness might ease – not because you think that's what will happen, but because you want to understand what matters to you about that tiny part of you?

Patient: That tiny part matters because it's the only scrap of hope that I actually care and that maybe this won't ruin everything. But the second it speaks the fortune-telling machine screams I'll freeze at work, my partner will leave, and I'll be left alone, so I yank my shoes on — I want to trust it, but it feels impossible and just... heavy.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tiny part of you matters because it's the only thing that feels like it's still connected to what matters to you – that hope that things won't be ruined. When the fortune-telling machine screams, it feels like that hope is being pulled away from you, and that's what matters to you about yanking your shoes on – not to make the pain go away, but to keep the pain from being all that matters. What if, instead of trying to make the pain go away, you could try to notice what it feels like to be pulled away by that hope – not to stop it, but to see what matters to you about it being there?

Patient: It feels like a tiny, stupid tug — a little hope that maybe things won't be completely ruined — and the moment I notice it my brain yells the disaster story and shame crashes in, so I yank my shoes and go. I don't really see how paying attention to that pull would help; it just leaves me exhausted and furious and then I'm off to shut it down.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that tiny tug feels like it's worth the exhaustion and fury – like it's just too hard to see what matters about it when the brain yells the disaster story. What if, instead of trying to "fix" that pull or make it go away, you could just notice it for a moment – not to change it, but to see what it's like to be pulled by it while you're already moving to shut it down?

Patient: Maybe it's that tiny tug—like a blink of "maybe it's okay"—but the second I actually notice it the fortune-telling machine screams that I’ll freeze at work, everyone will see me fail, my partner will leave, and I'll end up utterly alone, so I yank my shoes. I don't really see how paying attention to that pull while I'm already moving would help; it just makes me feel drained and angrier at myself for even trying. How is noticing supposed to stop the collapse I'm already picturing?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that tiny tug might actually feel like it's worth trying to notice while you're already moving – but the thought of stopping the collapse feels like it's already happening. What if, instead of trying to stop the collapse, what matters to you about noticing that tug is actually being present with it – not to change what's happening, but to see what's happening in your body and mind right now, while you're already moving?

Patient: Maybe that tug matters because it's the only tiny sign I'm not totally broken — like proof I still care. But the second I try to be present the fortune-telling kicks in: I'll freeze at work, everyone will see me fail, my partner will leave, and I'll end up alone — so I yank my shoes. I don't know how to actually stay with it; can we slow down? It just drains me.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tug matters because it's the smallest glimmer of connection to yourself – proof you still care. And when you try to be present with it, the fortune-telling machine kicks in, making you feel like you're failing even more. It's like the effort to stay with that tug feels like too much. Can we try something tiny for just one moment? What if, instead of trying to be present with the tug, we just notice that you're already moving to yank your shoes – not to change what's happening, but just to notice what that feels like in your body?

Patient: Okay… I'll try. Right now my chest is tight, my breath is shallow, my hands are already fumbling with the laces, and the fortune-telling voice is already listing the chain—I'll freeze at work, my partner will leave, I'll be alone. Noticing it just makes me more furious and exhausted. Can we slow down?
