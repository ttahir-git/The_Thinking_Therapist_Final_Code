Patient: I'm a senior software developer who recently moved, and I've been avoiding get-togethers because my anxiety just spikes in those situations. The moment I think about going, my head fills with the worst-case: I'll say something stupid, they'll judge me as incompetent, I'll get ostracized, my reputation will tank and I'll end up isolated and embarrassed forever. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't stop seeing that chain of disasters and it's been wearing me down.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of socializing is really tangled up with the fear of losing control and being seen as incompetent. When you imagine yourself saying something "stupid" or being judged, what's happening in your body - is it like your chest tightens or your stomach drops?

Patient: My chest tightens and my stomach drops, my hands get clammy and my heart starts racing so my thoughts go fuzzy. Then the fortune-telling starts up — I picture myself fumbling a word, everyone noticing, deciding I'm useless, the gossip spreading, and me getting shut out and alone, and my body just feeds that whole disaster loop.

Therapist: It sounds like when that "disaster" story shows up, your body gets really caught up in it - the physical sensations, the thoughts, the feelings. And then the fortune-telling part comes in, like you're seeing a movie playing out in your mind. Can you make space for that movie to be just that - a movie - without having to live it?

Patient: I wish I could, but I can't treat it like a movie — those images don't feel distant, they feel like previews of what's going to happen. If I try to downplay them, my chest tightens more because the next scenes are already playing: I fumble a word, someone laughs, it spreads, people decide I'm incompetent, I lose respect and end up cut off. Saying it's "just a movie" feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: Those previews do feel very real when you're in that moment. It sounds like trying to downplay them is actually making things worse, because that's what's fueling the next scenes.

Patient: I get that, but the "movie" never stays a movie for me — it keeps rolling into the worst scenes. My chest tightens, my words go fuzzy, I stammer, someone laughs, the whispers start, and before I know it my coworkers decide I'm useless, my projects get sidelined, and I'm left out and alone. I've tried talking myself down and imagining other outcomes, but those feel like lies — other outcomes don't seem realistic to me. I mostly rely on myself, and this whole thing is just wearing me down.

Therapist: It sounds like the "movie" keeps playing because it feels so real to you, even when you try to stop it. And when you talk yourself down, it feels like you're just distracting yourself from the underlying fear - the fear that if you say something "stupid," you'll lose control and be seen as incompetent.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. Trying to reassure myself just feels like papering over the "proof" that I'm about to mess up: my chest tightens, my words blur, and the rest of the disaster plays out in my head like it's already happened. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — imagining anything else just feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like the sense of proof - the feeling that you're about to mess up - is really tied to your anxiety. When you notice your chest tightening, it's like that proof is showing up right there, making it hard to imagine anything else.

Patient: Yeah — when my chest tightens it feels like a flashing neon sign that the worst is already happening. My brain grabs onto that and runs the whole catastrophe on repeat, and telling myself it might not happen just makes the tightness worse. I don't know how to sit with the feeling without it turning into that full disaster movie. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like when your chest tightens, that "neon sign" is actually what's driving the whole disaster movie - and it's hard to stop that from happening when you're feeling overwhelmed. Can I ask you to notice just that tightness for a moment, right now - without trying to "fix" it or stop it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try. My chest feels like a tight band, my breathing gets shallow, my hands go clammy and my head fogs over — and the instant I focus on that, the movie starts: I trip over a word, someone snickers, it spreads, and suddenly I'm the guy nobody trusts on the team. I don't know how to just notice it without the whole disaster chain kicking in louder, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness makes the whole movie even louder. I'm going to try something different. Instead of focusing on the tightness, can you notice where you are right now - the feeling of the band around your chest, the sensation of your breath moving in and out... just that moment?

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to feel the breath: it's shallow, the band in my chest is tight, my hands are a little clammy. But the second I focus, the movie starts louder — I trip on a word, someone laughs, it spreads, and I can already see myself getting sidelined at work. I don't know how to just hold the breath without the rest flooding in, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to focus on the breath, the whole movie comes crashing in anyway. Let's try something smaller. Instead of focusing on your breath, can you just notice the sensation of the band in your chest - just that feeling - for one second, without trying to change it?

Patient: I tried to hold it for a second, but the band tightens and my breath cuts off and the movie just dials up — I can already hear the chuckle, my voice collapsing, everyone deciding I'm useless, my projects getting reassigned, and me being frozen out. I'm jittery and my mind keeps jumping to the next horrible scene, so I can't just sit with the feeling without it exploding into that story. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you tried to hold the band, it actually got tighter - and the movie just got louder. Let's try something even smaller. Instead of focusing on your breath, or the band in your chest, or even the movie - can you just notice where your feet are sitting on the ground?

Patient: They're planted on the floor — heels heavy, I can feel the texture under my toes — but the moment I try to focus my mind jumps to the worst: I stumble, someone laughs, it spreads, I'm branded incompetent and cut out of the team. I'm more jittery and distracted than before and I can't hold the feeling; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even noticing your feet has triggered the movie again. Let's try something else. What if, instead of trying to control what's happening in your mind or body, you simply made room for it to be there - like you're noticing your feet, and the feeling in your chest, and the movie - without trying to change it?

Patient: I'll try, but making room just seems to let the movie ramp up — the band tightens, my breath snags, and I can already see myself stumbling on a sentence, someone laughing, whispers starting, and my projects getting reassigned. Imagining it not happening feels like lying to myself; I can't see any realistic outcome other than being written off. I'm jittery and my attention keeps flipping between the sensations and the next disaster scene — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like making room for the feeling feels like letting the movie get louder. Let's try something different. What would it mean for you, right now, if you could just notice the band in your chest - without trying to change it, or stop it, or make it go away - and then, just for a moment, what would you do with that space, even if it felt hard or uncomfortable?

Patient: If I let myself just notice the band, I think I'd freeze — my head would instantly push the whole disaster forward: I trip over a sentence, someone laughs, it spreads, my projects get reassigned, and I'm shut out for good. I don't see how that space helps; I'm worn down and my attention keeps slipping into the next awful scene, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the band would feel like the movie taking over. Can I ask you this: What would be different for you, if, even for just one moment, you weren't trying to change what's happening in that band - and you were just looking at it, as if it mattered, without trying to fix it?

Patient: If I just looked at it, I think I'd just freeze and let the movie run — I'd fumble a line, someone laughs, gossip starts, my projects get pulled, and I'm cut out. I can't see any upside to holding it; it only makes the tightness louder and I'm just... running on empty. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like looking at the band would feel like it's not worth doing. Let's try something else. What if, instead of trying to change what's happening in your chest, you just noticed where you are right now - not the band, not the movie, but where you are - physically, right in this moment?

Patient: Okay — I'm in the chair, feet on the floor, the room's quiet, but as soon as I try to stay with that the movie kicks in: I stumble on a sentence, someone snickers, it spreads, my projects get reassigned and I'm sidelined. I'm worn out and my attention's all over the place — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the quiet room actually makes the movie even louder. Let's try something smaller. What would it mean for you, right now, if you just noticed where your hand is - on the armrest, or on your knee?

Patient: My hand's on my knee, but the moment I notice it the movie kicks in — I trip over a sentence, someone laughs, whispers start, my projects get reassigned and I'm pushed out. I don't have the energy to keep battling it; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your hand on your knee doesn't bring peace. Let's try something else. What would it be like for you, if you didn't notice the movie at all - not even for a second - when you looked at your hand on your knee?

Patient: If I didn't notice the movie at all, it would feel like ignoring a blaring alarm — the worst would still happen. I'd trip over a sentence, someone would laugh, whispers would start, and my projects would get reassigned before I realize it. Pretending it's not there just feels like setting myself up to be blindsided. I'm worn out and my attention keeps slipping into the next awful scene, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even not noticing the movie feels like trying to outrun it. What if, instead of trying to avoid the worst, you could just notice what it would be like to be present with the sensation of being worn out - not as a problem to be solved, but just as it is - while still letting the movie play out?

Patient: I can try, but even noticing how worn out I am just turns the volume up — my chest clamps down, I freeze on a sentence, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get reassigned and I'm sidelined. I don't see how sitting with it helps; I'm too drained and my mind keeps snapping to the next disaster, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your weariness just makes things worse. I want to try one more thing. What if, while you're noticing how worn out you are, you could also notice what it feels like to *let go* of that weariness - not as a problem to solve, but just as it is - and then see what happens when you do that small act of letting go, even for just a tiny bit?

Patient: I can't even picture letting go — it feels like loosening my grip and the whole train of disasters just runs me over. The second I try to relax a bit my chest clamps, the movie spikes: I blurt something, they laugh, it spreads, my work gets taken away and I'm finished. I'm worn out and it's hard to try this right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of letting go feels like losing control. I'm going to try something gentle. What if, instead of trying to let go, you could just notice the sensation of your chest clamping down - without trying to change it, or stop it, or let go of it - just as it is, right now, in this moment?

Patient: Okay... my chest is clamping — a tight band, breath shallow, hands damp — and the second I focus the movie starts: I stammer, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get reassigned and I'm sidelined for good. I don't know how to just notice it without the whole chain firing up louder, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the chest clamping down makes the movie even louder. Let's try to make room for it, just for a moment. What if you could notice the tight band in your chest, the shallow breath, the damp hands - and at the same time, just notice the thought "I stammer, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get reassigned and I'm sidelined for good" - as if it's just a thought, not as if it's true?

Patient: I can't make it feel like "just a thought" — the second I try, my chest tightens worse and the movie goes full blast: I stammer, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get reassigned and I'm finished. I'm jittery and scattered right now and I don't have the energy for this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to see it as "just a thought" feels like it's not working. I'm going to try something different. What if, instead of trying to change what's happening in your chest, you could just notice what it would be like to notice it - not to change it, not to stop it, just to notice it - and then what would happen if you did that small act of noticing, even for just one second?

Patient: Even trying that for one second feels impossible — the moment I notice the band it tightens, my breath snaps, and the movie just goes full-tilt: I stammer, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get yanked and I'm cut out. I'm jittery and my attention's all over the place and I don't have the energy for this right now, so can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of trying to notice it even for a second feels like it's not worth it. I want to try one more thing. What if, instead of trying to control what's happening in your chest, you could just notice what's already happening right now - not the movie, not the thoughts, just what's present in your body and mind - and then, without changing it, what would it be like to *move forward* in that moment, even if it's just a tiny step?

Patient: If I tried to take even a tiny step right now my chest would clamp, my words would trip, someone would snicker, the whispers would start, my projects would get yanked and I'd be shut out — that's what always happens, so trying feels pointless. I'm running on empty, my head's foggy and scattered, and I can't hold this long — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to move forward feels like it's not possible. I'm going to try to understand what's happening in that moment. You're saying that even trying to take a tiny step feels like it will lead to the same kind of outcome - the chest clamping, the tripping words, the snickers, the whispers, the getting yanked. And that makes sense. It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and scared right now.

Patient: Yeah... I hear you, but I just feel stuck — every time I even imagine a tiny step it turns into the same movie: chest clamps, I trip over a sentence, someone snickers, whispers start, my projects get pulled and I'm out. I'm really worn thin and my mind's all over the place right now, so can we slow down and just stay with this for a moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're just trying to stay with the feeling of being stuck right now, without trying to change it or move forward. I'm here with you, in this moment, without judgment. Can you just notice that you're feeling really worn thin and your mind's all over the place, without trying to fix it or make it go away?

Patient: Okay... I can feel it — I'm worn thin, my head's scattered, my chest's tight and my breathing's shallow. But the second I notice it the whole disaster ramps up — I trip on a sentence, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get yanked and I'm shut out — I don't have the energy to keep this up, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the weariness is actually making the disaster feel even more overwhelming. I'm going to try to make room for that feeling, just for a moment. What if, while you're noticing the weariness and the chest tightening, you could also notice that it's not changing - not because you're trying to make it go away, but just because it is what it is?

Patient: If it just stays the same, that just feels like proof the worst is coming — the band stays tight, I freeze, I blurt something dumb, someone laughs, whispers spread, my projects get reassigned and I'm out. I can't see any other realistic outcome and I'm wiped; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought that the worst is coming feels like it's not just a possibility, but a certainty. And that certainty is really exhausting you. I'm going to try to make room for that exhaustion, without trying to change what's happening. What would it be like to just hold that exhaustion - not to try to fix it, not to change it - but just to hold it, for a moment?

Patient: If I try to hold it, it feels like I'm admitting it's already happened — the band stays tight, I freeze, I blurt something stupid, someone laughs, it spreads, my projects get reassigned and I'm sidelined for good. I'm running on fumes and it's all getting too much, so can we slow down?
