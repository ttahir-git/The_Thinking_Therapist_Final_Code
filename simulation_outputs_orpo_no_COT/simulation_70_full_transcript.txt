--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I keep getting stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism whenever I feel like I've failed at something—I'm an accountant and starting a demanding new role has made the anxiety worse. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved family, so I tend to bottle things up and then beat myself up over not being good enough. I don't know how talking about this will help—how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Noticing how the thought of talking about this is also stuck in that loop of self-criticism is really brave. What would it be like to hold both that thought ("I don't know how talking about this will help") and the anxiety about not being good enough, without trying to make one of them go away?

Patient: I guess if I try to hold both it just feels... kind of jumbled, like they're fighting for space and my chest tightens. I notice a bunch of "I'm failing" thoughts and then this urge to fix or shove them away, but part of me can sit with it without panicking. Still, I'm not convinced—how is that supposed to help me actually stop beating myself up?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like making room for that jumbled feeling, even for just a moment, feels small enough to experiment with. What if, when the urge to fix or shove those thoughts away shows up, you could notice that urge without trying to change it—just for the sake of seeing how that might be connected to that "I'm failing" story?

Patient: Okay, I can try noticing the urge without pushing it away, but when I do it feels like a knot in my chest and that running commentary—"fix it, you're failing"—just keeps talking. I've tried mindfulness and breathing before and it didn't stop the critic; usually it just waits and comes back louder. How is that supposed to help me actually stop beating myself up, practically speaking?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The knot in your chest sounds really tough. It might be helpful to notice what happens when you try to breathe or focus on that knot while the critic is still there—what if, instead of trying to stop the knot or the critic, you could notice that they're both showing up together, like you said, and that it's taking a lot of energy to keep going as if you could control them?

Patient: I try that—when I notice both the knot and the critic, the knot stays and the critic just gets louder, narrating everything I did wrong. I can sit with it for a minute, then it gets unbearable and I start spiraling about work mistakes. I'm not convinced—how is that supposed to actually reduce the self-criticism when it just keeps coming back? Can you give me something concrete I can do in the moment at my desk when it starts?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot and the critic are really tied up together for you. What if, when that knot starts to feel unbearable, you could try one tiny thing that doesn't require fixing the knot or the critic—just a small movement that lets you stay with the pain, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Alright — I can try something tiny like pressing my feet into the floor or rolling a pen between my fingers at my desk. I've done little grounding things before and usually the critic just talks louder, so I'm skeptical — but okay, I'm pressing my feet now and it's... a little less tight in my chest, but the voice is still there. How is that supposed to turn into actually stopping the self-criticism when it just keeps coming back?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: The tiny movement seems to have made a small difference. When you notice the voice coming back, what if you could try not adding to the story about what's wrong with it—that voice—by noticing just what's happening in your body while you're sitting there with the pen in your hand?

Patient: Okay—I tried it just now, sitting with the pen and focusing on the sensations in my hand and the pressure in my chest; it loosened a little but the critic just keeps narrating every mistake like a running tab. When I notice my body, my head goes straight into analyzing and then into that spiral about work—so it feels like it only delays the blow, it doesn't stop it. How is noticing the body supposed to actually reduce the critic when it just comes back louder? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the body feels like it's getting caught up in the same pattern of analysis that you're trying to avoid. What if, instead of trying to stop the critic or the body from noticing the pain, you could try to notice what's happening *while* you're noticing the body—when the critic shows up, what's it like to sit with that *while* you're still noticing the sensations in your hand?

Patient: When I try to sit with both, the critic just layers on top of the sensations and starts narrating them—“you’re weak, you’re making excuses”—and my chest tightens and I get frustrated with myself for not being able to shut it up. I can hold it for a little while, but it feels like a delay before the spiral, and then I end up blaming myself for not making progress. I’m trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I’m struggling—how is that supposed to help me actually change the pattern?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is really good at making you feel like you're failing at stopping it. What if, instead of trying to stop the critic or the body from noticing the pain, you could try to notice what's happening *while* you're feeling that sense of failure—that the critic shows up and you feel like you're not making progress—what would that mean for you if you weren't trying to stop it?

Patient: If I wasn't trying to stop it, I guess it'd feel like admitting I'm not in control — that's scary, but also maybe less exhausting because I wouldn't be using all my energy to fight it. Maybe I'd be able to spot the patterns sooner instead of spiraling, but part of me worries that's just giving the critic more room to rant. How is that supposed to help me actually quiet the critic at my desk though? I need something practical, not just "notice."


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Noticing what happens *while* you're feeling that sense of failure might not be the same as changing the pattern. What if, instead of trying to notice what the critic says while you're fighting it, you could try to notice what your hands do while you're sitting at your desk?

Patient: When I look at my hands I notice they tense up, grip the pen, then start tapping or rubbing the knuckle—sometimes they just freeze and I keep scrolling through emails. It gives a tiny pause, like a hiccup, but the critic just keeps narrating everything as soon as I stop focusing on my hands. I've tried focusing on little movements before—how is that supposed to actually quiet the critic when it just comes back?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: The small pause when you notice your hands seems like a tiny crack in the pattern. What if, when the critic shows up again, you could try to make that small pause bigger by noticing your hands again—just for a moment—*before* you try to fight the critic?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is making that tiny pause bigger by looking at my hands actually supposed to help when the critic just gets louder? At my desk it feels like: chest tight, critic yelling, I glance at my hands and the critic just narrates the pause and then I'm spiraling again. Can you give me a concrete step I could do in that moment that doesn't just feel like delaying the blow?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're right, just noticing your hands again won't change the critic. What if, when the critic shows up again, you could try making a small, tiny action with your hand *while* you're still noticing the chest tightness and the critic's voice—something so small it wouldn't even be noticeable if you weren't doing it *while* you're noticing the critic?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — do you mean like a tiny, almost invisible movement with my hand while I'm noticing the chest tightness? At my desk that just sounds like another thing for the critic to narrate, and honestly it feels like we're just rearranging the same loop. How is that supposed to actually change the critic? Give me one specific, doable action I can try right now that isn't just delaying the spiral — because I keep feeling like we're going in circles and it's frustrating.


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and frustrated. When you notice the critic showing up while you're trying to focus on your hands, what would happen *exactly* if you simply *let go* of trying to make that tiny movement with your hand—just for a second, without changing anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. If I just let go for a second, usually nothing magical happens—the chest still tightens, my breath gets shallow, and the critic immediately fills the silence with that running tab of mistakes. Sometimes there's a tiny, half-second loosening, but it feels like the critic notices that pause and gets louder, and then I end up freezing at my desk or frantically scrolling through emails. How is that supposed to actually stop the critic instead of just... delaying the spiral?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that letting go doesn't necessarily make the critic quieter. What if, instead of trying to control the critic with a tiny movement, you tried to notice what would happen if you simply *allowed* the critic to be there while you tried to do your work?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — if I just "allow" the critic to be there while I work, I picture it getting louder and me freezing up or mindlessly scrolling through emails. Maybe, in theory, it would make me less exhausted by the fight, but I can't see how that actually helps me get through a spreadsheet or a reconciliation without spiraling. Can you give me one specific, doable step I can use mid-task when the critic floods in that isn't just letting it rant? How is that supposed to help me finish the work instead of just feeling worse?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that just allowing the critic to be there will make it louder. What if, when the critic shows up while you're working, you could try to notice the exact word that's coming up—like, "I'm such a failure" or "I'm not good enough"—and then make a small, tiny *physical* action with your hand, like tapping your pen on the desk *just once*, without stopping or trying to fight the critic?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is tapping the pen once supposed to help? It just sounds like another thing the critic can narrate. I can try it now: I notice the thought "I'm failing" and tap once, and honestly it felt almost meaningless—the critic's still there, louder than before. How is that supposed to actually help me get through a spreadsheet instead of just being a tiny, useless pause?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the physical action of tapping the pen didn't actually change the critic's voice. What if, when you notice the critic showing up while you're working, you could try to notice what happens to your body when you *stop* trying to make the tiny action happen?

Patient: When I stop trying to do the tiny action, my hands go a bit limp, my chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, and the critic immediately fills the space—usually louder—and I either freeze or start scrolling through emails. It honestly feels like letting go just gives it more room, not less. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that bodily change helps me actually finish a spreadsheet or get through a task—how is that supposed to help me quiet the critic in the moment? I'm getting frustrated; it feels like we're going in circles and I need one specific, doable step that actually keeps me working.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the bodily change doesn't actually help you quiet the critic. What if, when the critic shows up while you're working, you could try to notice what happens to the spreadsheet or the task itself—what's the *next* step you need to take to make progress, not the critic's voice?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—when I'm flooded I literally can't see the next step on the spreadsheet. In theory it's simple (open the unreconciled filter, pick the next row) but in the moment my chest tightens, my mind blanks, and I just scroll. Tell me one concrete, tiny instruction I can do without thinking—something like "open row 7 and enter the date"—that will actually move the work forward instead of just delaying the spiral. How is that supposed to help me finish the task instead of making me feel worse?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting stuck in the flood. What if, when you notice the critic showing up, you simply *move the cursor to the first blank cell* in the unreconciled filter, without thinking about what's next or what the critic says?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — moving the cursor sounds almost meaningless when I'm flooded; I can't even see the cell sometimes. I can try moving the cursor to the first blank cell, but then what exactly do I do there without the critic taking over? How is that supposed to stop the critic from hijacking me and actually get me to enter the data?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like moving the cursor itself isn't enough to counter the critic. What if, when you move the cursor to the first blank cell, you simply *put the pen down* and let your hand rest on the desk, without trying to do anything else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. If I put the pen down, the critic just calls it avoidance and gets louder—my chest tightens and I end up scrolling. It feels like every little "pause" just becomes proof I'm failing. Give me one tiny, specific action I can do at my desk right now that actually moves the spreadsheet forward instead of just delaying the spiral—how is that supposed to help?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the critic is using your attempts to pause as evidence of failure. What if, when you move the cursor to the first blank cell, you *just type the date* without thinking about the critic's voice or what it means?

Patient: I'm jittery and distracted right now—my chest's tight and my hands are shaking when I try to do anything. I tried to move the cursor and type the date and the critic just called it tokenism, I froze, and then I started scrolling; it felt pointless. How is typing a date supposed to help me actually get through the whole spreadsheet when the flood takes over? Give me one concrete, step-by-step thing I can do right now that actually keeps me working.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is making it hard for you to focus. What if, when you notice the critic showing up while you're trying to type the date, you *take a deep breath* and *say the date out loud* to yourself, without stopping or trying to make it perfect?

Patient: I tried taking a breath and saying the date out loud just now, but my voice shook and the critic immediately mocked it as performative—I still froze and started scrolling. I'm jittery and distracted and I can't tell if saying it out loud is helping or just another thing to fail at. Give me one exact, tiny step I can do right after saying the date that will actually keep me in the spreadsheet, because I'm getting impatient with these vague suggestions.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is using your vulnerability as proof. What if, right after saying the date out loud, you *type the next word* ("the") without waiting for your voice to calm down or trying to make it perfect?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—typing "the" feels pointless and the critic just calls it performative. I tried something like that just now and my hands shook, I froze, and then I started scrolling; it doesn't keep me in the spreadsheet. Tell me one exact, concrete step to do immediately after typing that will actually keep me working—how is this supposed to help me finish the task instead of just giving the critic more to mock?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is making it hard for you to take small steps. What if, right after typing "the", you *click the "next cell" button* to move to the next blank cell, without waiting for your hands to stop shaking or your voice to calm down?

Patient: I tried clicking the next cell just now—my hands were shaking, the critic immediately called it performative, and I still froze and started scrolling. How is clicking a button supposed to keep me from spiraling and actually staying on the task? Give me one exact, step‑by‑step sequence I can do right now at my desk that will get me to enter data and stay there—no vague stuff. I'm getting impatient; it feels like we're going in circles and I need something that actually works.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is using your attempts to click as evidence of failure. What if, right after clicking the "next cell" button, you *put the mouse down* and *pick up the pen*, and then *type the date* again, this time without thinking about the critic's voice or what it means?

Patient: I tried that—put the mouse down, picked up the pen, typed the date, but my hands were shaking, the critic called it performative, and I still froze and started scrolling. It feels like the same loop where tiny moves just become more things for the critic to mock. Give me one exact, 4‑step sequence I can do right now at my desk (no fluff) that will actually get me to enter the data and keep me on the spreadsheet—how is that supposed to help me finish the task?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the loop is feeling overwhelming. What if, right now, you simply *put the pen down*, *pick up the mouse*, *move the cursor to the first blank cell*, and *click the "enter" button* to type the date?

Patient: I'm jittery and distracted right now — my hands are shaking just thinking about it, and I can't see how that sequence will change the freeze. I tried similar step-by-step stuff before (put the pen down, move the cursor, click) and the critic just mocked it and I still scrolled away. I'm not sure I follow how this actually gets me to enter the data and stay with the spreadsheet — give me one different, exact micro-step I can do right now that will actually keep me working, not just delay the spiral; I'm getting frustrated because this feels like we're going in circles.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is making it hard to take small steps. What if, right now, you *move the mouse just 1/4 inch* to the right of the cursor, without thinking about the critic's voice or what it means, and then *keep your hand still* for just 1 second?

Patient: I tried that—I'm jittery and my hands are shaking. I nudged the mouse a tiny bit and kept still for a second, but the critic just got louder and I froze. How is that supposed to help me actually enter the date and stay on the spreadsheet? Give me one exact, step‑by‑step, no‑fluff 4‑step action I can do right now that will get the data entered and keep me working.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the critic is using your physical movement as evidence of failure. What if, right now, you *hold the pen on the desk* *at the same height* *as it was when you typed the first letter* and *type the next letter* without moving the pen or waiting for your hand to calm down?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — that feels like another tiny, performative move the critic will just mock. My hands are shaking and holding the pen steady feels impossible right now; I can barely breathe. If you're going to give me something, tell me one exact 4‑step thing I can do RIGHT NOW that ends with the date actually entered and keeps me on the spreadsheet, no fluff.
