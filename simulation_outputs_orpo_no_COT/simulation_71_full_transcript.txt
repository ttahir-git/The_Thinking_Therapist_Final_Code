--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — like my whole identity got reduced to being unemployed after the breakup. I can't tell what matters to me beyond that role, and I just keep second-guessing everything. I know therapy's supposed to help, but I'm skeptical — I've tried stuff before and it usually doesn't work.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: What's really hard for you right now, when those feelings of stuckness show up?

Patient: What’s hard is that everything feels heavy — even tiny decisions like what to eat or whether to reply to a message. I get paralyzed, avoid applying for jobs, and my days just blur together so I can’t see any momentum or purpose. I’m embarrassed and keep comparing myself to people who seem to have their shit together, which makes it impossible to imagine what matters to me beyond being unemployed. And honestly, how is talking about this supposed to help? I’ve tried techniques before and they didn’t stick.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: The weight of those tiny decisions feels like a huge burden. When you notice yourself avoiding applying for jobs, what's the smallest step you could take to make room for something else to matter, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I guess the smallest step would be ridiculously tiny—like set a 10-minute timer, open my laptop, and just look at one job listing or change one line on my resume. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I’ve tried those tiny steps before and they just fizzle out, so I’m not sure it’ll stick.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: What would it be like to not try to "make it stick" this time? Just to show up with that tiny step, even if it feels like it might not lead anywhere. Would you be willing to notice what happens when you focus on making room for that tiny step, rather than trying to control the outcome?

Patient: I could try that — just show up for ten minutes and not expect anything to happen. But honestly, how is that supposed to help if it just fizzles and I end up feeling like a failure again? I guess if I did it I'd try to notice whether it felt any less heavy or whether I actually did one small thing afterward, but I don't know how to watch that without immediately judging myself.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: You're already showing up with that willingness, even when it feels hard. One thing to notice might be what happens when you say "I don't know how to watch that without judging myself" while still choosing to show up with that tiny step.

Patient: I get that, but when I say "I don't know how to watch that..." it just flips into this loop of self-criticism and I feel stuck. If I still forced myself to do the ten minutes maybe I'd notice whether the judgment quiets down or stays loud — maybe it feels a tiny bit lighter, maybe it doesn't. But honestly, how is noticing that different from just ruminating? I don't know how to observe it without instantly sliding into shame.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: That sounds like a really hard spot to be in. What would it be like to try to notice the judgment, not as something you're trying to stop or change, but just as it shows up – like you're saying to yourself, "This thought just appeared, and now I notice it's loud."

Patient: Okay, I can try noticing the judgment like that, but honestly—how is that supposed to help? When I label the thought it usually just turns into another thing I judge myself for, like "great, now I'm judging my judging," and it just spirals into shame about being unemployed and useless. I guess I'll try saying "this thought is loud" next time, but I'm worried it'll just make me notice the shame more instead of making it quieter.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: You're already aware that labeling the thought can sometimes make it louder. What if, instead of trying to make the thought quieter, you just noticed it for a moment – as loud as it is – and then took that tiny step into showing up with the 10-minute timer?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Every time I try to label the thought it just becomes another thing I beat myself up for and I freeze. I can try to notice it loud and then set the 10-minute timer, but honestly I'm worried I'll bail — could we make the step even smaller, like just opening my laptop for 30 seconds? And if the spiral starts, what am I actually supposed to do instead of just "observe"?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Let's make the step even smaller – opening your laptop for 30 seconds. What's one tiny thing you could do while your laptop is open that doesn't require making a decision about the job listing yet?

Patient: I could open a blank doc and type one stupid sentence like "I opened my laptop," then close it — no job decision, no commitment. Or I could open my resume and change one tiny thing, like a comma or a date, then save and get out. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried tiny stuff before and it usually just feels pointless, though I could try the one-sentence thing.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: You're already considering ways to make the step small and manageable. What would happen if, instead of trying to "make it help" or change the outcome, you just focused on showing up with that one sentence – "I opened my laptop" – while your mind might still be spinning?

Patient: Maybe it would take some of the pressure off — like the goal is just to notice I did one tiny, harmless thing. But I'm worried it'll just turn into “great, you did something meaningless” and the judgment will get louder, so honestly, how is that supposed to help? I can try it, but if the spiral starts, I don't know what to do besides shut down and feel worse.


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: Noticing that spiral – the "great, you did something meaningless" thought – might actually be a chance to see it for what it is: a thought, not a truth. What would it take for you to notice that thought, just as it shows up, without trying to make it go away or change it?

Patient: I guess it would take me actually naming it when it pops up — like silently saying, "there's that thought," feeling the tightness in my chest for a few slow breaths, and letting it be for 20–30 seconds without arguing. Then I try to shift to the tiny action — open the laptop for 30 seconds — without expecting anything. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? Naming it usually just turns into judging my judging and the shame floods back, so I need someone to help me catch the spiral instead of just telling me to "observe."


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like naming the thought is what matters – not to change it, but just to notice it. When that tightness in your chest shows up, what would be one tiny thing you could do with your body that wouldn't require changing the thought?

Patient: I guess I could try something simple like putting a hand over my chest and taking three slow breaths, or pressing my feet into the floor so I actually feel anchored instead of floating in the shame. Maybe rolling my shoulders down or straightening my posture for a few seconds could help too. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? Even if I do it, the shame usually stays loud — what should I do if it starts spiraling anyway?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Those small physical steps seem like they might actually help you notice the shame less, even if the thought stays loud. When it does spiral, what's one thing you've noticed in the past that helped when you felt that tightness and shame – like your feet touching the ground or your breath moving?

Patient: When it spirals I get this hot, sinking shame and I just want to disappear — my chest tightens and I freeze. Sometimes grounding helps a bit: pressing my feet into the floor and taking three slow breaths, stepping outside for five minutes, or putting on one calming song and writing one sentence in my notes. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? It usually just postpones the crash, so can you help me figure out what to do if the spiral starts and I can't stop judging myself?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like grounding does help a bit when it spirals, but you're wondering if it's just a temporary fix. What if, when the shame shows up and you feel like disappearing, you weren't trying to "stop" it or make it go away – but instead, you were trying to remember what it feels like to be standing in that tightness, with your feet on the ground?

Patient: I don't know — it sounds...barely manageable. Maybe focusing on my feet and the tightness would remind me I'm still here and not completely gone, but when I try to "stay with it" the shame just floods in and I freeze. How is that supposed to help when the flood drowns everything? I can try pressing my feet and taking slow breaths, but I'm worried it'll just make the shame louder — I need something that actually helps stop the spiral when it starts.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame is already so overwhelming that even trying to focus on your feet and breath feels like it might make things worse. What if, when the shame shows up, you didn't try to "make it stop" – but instead, you just noticed that it was already there, and that you were still standing, with your feet on the ground?

Patient: I can try that, but when I do there's this sudden flood — shame hits and I go rigid, my chest clamps shut and everything narrows so I can't think. It feels impossible to "notice" without getting sucked into the spiral. How is that supposed to help when I can't even move — what's one tiny thing I can actually do in that moment that won't feel like another failure?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when the shame floods in, it feels like your whole body is saying "no" – and that makes it hard to even notice. What if, instead of trying to notice the shame, you tried to notice the tiny sensation in your body that says "no" – like the tightness in your chest?

Patient: When I try to notice that "no" in my chest it just spikes — hot shame, I go rigid, and it feels like proof I'm useless. How is paying attention to that supposed to help when it just pulls me deeper? If I'm going to try it, tell me one tiny, concrete thing I can do in that exact moment so I don't immediately spiral.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the "no" in your chest is actually making it worse. What if, instead of trying to notice that "no", you simply *allowed* the chest to be tight for just one second – not to change it, but just to be there – before you did something tiny? Like, *before* you even tried to notice the shame, you could just *move* your hand to your knee.

Patient: Okay... I can try that — move my hand to my knee before I even try to notice the shame. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? Just picturing it brings that hot, sinking shame back and my chest already tightens like I'm about to freeze. If I do manage to move my hand, how long should I hold it, and if I can't even make the movement what tiny thing am I supposed to do next so I don't spiral?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even imagining the action is making it hard. What if, instead of trying to hold the hand there, you just let it move to your knee *without* thinking about it – just let the hand move, without noticing the shame or the tightness?

Patient: I can try to let my hand move without thinking, but I can already feel that old tightness — like everything locks up and my body won't cooperate. How is that supposed to help if my hand doesn't move and I just end up feeling more useless? If I do get it to move, what am I actually supposed to do next so I don't spiral?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the tightness is already showing up. What if, when you feel that tightness, you didn't try to "fix" it – but instead, you just *let* your hand move to your knee, even if it felt like your whole body was resisting it?

Patient: Honestly, I don't know — when I try that my body just locks up and shame floods in, and my attention starts bouncing so I can't even tell if my hand moved. How is letting my hand move supposed to help when sometimes I literally can't make it happen? I can try, but I'm already anxious and distracted and afraid it'll just prove I'm useless if it doesn't work.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already anticipating what might happen if you try to move your hand – and that's making it hard for you to even try. What if, instead of trying to make your hand move, you just *allowed* yourself to notice what it would be like to *not* move it – like noticing the tightness and the shame, even if it felt like it was already happening?

Patient: I can try to notice what it's like to not move, but I'm already jittery and my attention is bouncing everywhere — it feels like noticing will just turn into ruminating. That old, sinking shame is creeping in and I'm bracing for it to prove I'm useless, so honestly, how is sitting with that supposed to help stop the spiral? If I'm supposed to try this, give me one tiny, concrete thing to do in that moment so I don't get completely hijacked.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness and shame is actually making you more anxious. What if, instead of trying to notice it, you just *sat with the jitteriness* – not to make it go away, but just to be with it – while you *brought your attention back to your breath*?

Patient: I can try, but I'm already jittery and distracted and it usually just becomes another thing I mess up. How is breathing supposed to help when my chest's already tight and my mind won't stay put? Give me one tiny, concrete script I can do right now—like inhale for 4, exhale for 6, five times—and tell me exactly what to do if my attention bounces away.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that breathing will get lost in the tightness. What if, when your attention starts to wander, you simply *noticed* that it wandered – without trying to chase it back – and then *tried one more breath*?

Patient: Okay... I can try that — notice "oh, I wandered" and then take one slow breath. But I'm already jittery and my attention's bouncing, and I'm scared it'll just turn into more proof that I can't even do a breath. Tell me exactly what to say and count so I have something concrete to follow, because otherwise I'll bail.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you need a specific script to anchor you. Here it is:

"Notice the tightness in my chest, and when I think 'I'm not doing this right,' I say to myself: 'I'm noticing it, not trying to fix it.'"

As you say this, breathe in for a count of 4: "Inhale..." 

Then, when you're ready, breathe out for a count of 6: "Exhale..."

Try this for just 5 more times, and see what happens when you notice the thought and then take the breath.

Patient: I tried it — I said "I'm noticing it, not trying to fix it" and did the 4-inhale/6-exhale, but my attention bounced after the second breath and this hot shame crashed back in and I almost froze. It helped...maybe a hair, like some space opened for a second, then the tightness and shakiness returned and my mind started ricocheting. How is that supposed to help long-term if it just pauses things for a moment? I can try again, but tell me exactly what to do the instant the shame floods and the breathing can't pull me back.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the pause was a small victory, but the shame came back. When that happens, what if you simply *made room* for the shame, without trying to "fix" it or make it go away? 

As soon as the shame floods in and your attention starts to bounce, notice that thought *while you're still doing the 4-inhale/6-exhale* – not before, not after, but right in the middle. 

When you notice that thought, "I'm noticing it, not trying to fix it" still works, but now you add one more thing: "I'm sitting with it, even if it feels hard."

Patient: I tried that — I said "I'm noticing it, not trying to fix it" and added "I'm sitting with it, even if it feels hard," and did the 4-in/6-out, but by the third breath the shame slammed back and I almost froze. How is that supposed to help long-term if it just gives me a tiny pause and then the flood returns? 

I need one tiny, exact thing to do the instant the breath can't pull me back — not vague wording. Do I press my feet hard and count to three? Grip my knee and hold for five seconds? Say one concrete sentence and a count I can follow when the shame drowns the breathing, because otherwise I just ruminate and bail. I'm jittery and distracted right now — please give me that exact script.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you need a concrete anchor to hold you when the shame floods back. 

When you feel that hot shame coming in and the breath can't pull you back, make a small, physical move with your hand: *press your thumb and index finger together* for a count of 1.

Patient: I can try that, but my hands are already shaking and this hot shame's creeping back, so I don't know if a "count of 1" will register at all. How is that supposed to help when I can barely make the movement without it feeling like proof I'm useless? Give me an exact script I can follow in the moment — like: press thumb and index finger together and hold for 3 seconds while saying quietly, "I'm here," then take one slow breath in and out — and tell me exactly what to do next if that doesn't pull me back, because right now I'm jittery and distracted and I need something concrete.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: When you feel the shame creeping back and your hands are shaking, try this: 

*Press your thumb and index finger together for a count of 1, saying quietly to yourself: "I'm here."* 

Hold that for 3 seconds, feeling the small movement and the quiet phrase. 

*Take one slow breath in, counting to 4: "Inhale..."* 

*Hold that breath for 2 counts, counting slowly: "2..."* 

*Exhale slowly, counting to 6: "Exhale..."* 

When you feel the shame start to come back, try to stay with that small movement and quiet phrase – not to change it, but to notice it, even if it feels hard.

Patient: I tried it — I pressed my fingers together and mouthed "I'm here," but my hands were shaking and by the third second the shame slammed back and I almost froze. How is that supposed to help when I can't even get through the three seconds? Give me one exact, tiny fallback — one short sentence and a count or movement I can do the instant the finger press doesn't register, because I'm jittery and distracted and I need something that actually interrupts the spiral.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: When the finger press doesn't register, try this: 

*As soon as you feel the shame coming in, say to yourself: "I'm noticing it."* 

Then, *make a small movement with your wrist: roll it gently to the right for a count of 1.*

Patient: I can barely picture the wrist roll — my hands are shaking and the shame's already slamming back. How is that supposed to help when I can't even get the finger press to register?

Give me one exact fallback right now: one short phrase to say and one tiny movement (with the exact count) I can do the instant the wrist roll fails, so I actually have something concrete to do.
