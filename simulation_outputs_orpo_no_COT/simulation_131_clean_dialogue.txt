Patient: I've been burying myself in schoolwork to avoid the grief and the numbness since the loss, but it's getting harder to keep up. The minute I slow down I see the worst: I'll miss a deadline, fail a class, lose my funding, and then everything collapses — that's what always happens in my head. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't stop those stories and they keep me overworking even when I'm exhausted.

Therapist: Those stories feel really real to you right now. When you notice them, what happens when you try to "push them away" by getting back to schoolwork?

Patient: I dive into work like it's a shield — I make a rigid plan, pull long hours, skip meals, and it dulls the panic for a bit. But the stories don't go away; they just quiet down until I'm so exhausted I make a small mistake, and in my head that small mistake becomes "missed deadline → fail class → lose funding → everything falls apart." People tell me other outcomes are possible, but I can't picture them — the disaster story feels inevitable, so I just keep pushing until I crash.

Therapist: It sounds like you're using your exhaustion to help you avoid the "disaster story" just enough to keep going. What's the small mistake you mentioned earlier that triggers the panic? If you could make room for that small mistake right now, just for a moment, what might happen if you didn't try to push it away?

Patient: It's usually something tiny—like forgetting to attach the file or oversleeping and missing a submission because I'm exhausted. If I let that sit for a second, I just imagine the whole chain: missed assignment, fail the module, lose my funding, get kicked out, everyone thinks I ruined whatever future I had—it's like that outcome definitely happens. People suggest other possibilities, but I can't picture them, so I just end up forcing myself to work harder until I burn out.

Therapist: So even with that small mistake, the "disaster story" feels like a certainty. What matters to you in those moments when you're so tired that even that small mistake feels like it's worth getting rid of?

Patient: What matters in those moments is not letting one stupid slip become the thing that starts the collapse — keeping my funding, my place in the program, and the few people who still think I'm competent. I want control so no one sees me fall apart or thinks I couldn't handle the loss; if I don't stop the mistake, it's a straight line to losing everything, and I can't accept that. People tell me other things could happen, but I can't see them — the disaster is the only real outcome.

Therapist: You're holding onto control of that outcome because it feels like the only way to protect the people and things that matter to you. What if, in that moment when you're holding onto control, you could make room for just one tiny bit of what matters to you - like keeping your funding, or your place in the program - without needing to stop the "disaster story" from happening?

Patient: I want that — I really do — but I can't picture any outcome where loosening up doesn't start the collapse. The second I imagine making room I see the missed deadline spiraling into everything falling apart, and I panic and bury myself in work until I'm wrecked. What would "making room" even look like, because I can't imagine it without disaster?

Therapist: When you try to picture making room for what matters, the "disaster story" shows up anyway. That's okay. Instead of trying to push that story away or stop it from happening, what if you noticed it as it shows up - like a thought in the background - and simply asked: "What would it be like to notice that story *while* you're making room for what matters to you?"

Patient: If I try to notice the story while making room, it just sits there like a loud narrator I can't turn off — I hear the whole collapse in the background and it still runs the show. Noticing feels almost useless because the chain is immediate: missed deadline, fail the module, lose funding, get kicked out, everyone loses trust — it's all vivid and inevitable. I want to hold the two things at once, but the disaster drowns out what matters and I end up tightening my grip on work even more.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the story is like trying to tune out the radio while the music is blasting - it's still there, but you can't turn it off. What if, instead of trying to notice the story, you could make room for what matters to you *while* the story is still there? Not as the problem, but as the thing that matters - like, "I care about keeping my funding *while* I see the story showing up" - without trying to stop it from happening.

Patient: I’ve tried saying that to myself, but the moment I try to hold both the disaster and what matters, the catastrophe voice gets louder and I can’t breathe. It feels impossible to make room — the story drowns out everything, so I just clamp down and work harder. I don’t see how to actually do it without the collapse starting; can you give a concrete example? I’m pretty sure it won’t help, but I’ll try if you walk me through it.

Therapist: I'm going to try to give you a small example, not because I think it will magically solve everything, but because it might help you notice what's happening just a little bit differently. Are you willing to try this tiny experiment with me?

Patient: Okay, fine — I’ll try, though I’m almost certain it won’t help and that if it flops it’ll just prove the disaster story is real. Go slow — I get flooded fast, so walk me through it step by step.

Therapist: Let's try this tiny experiment. When you're feeling really tight about the work and the disaster story showing up, I want you to notice one tiny thing for just 1 second. That's it. Just one second. *pause*

Patient: I did it — I focused for a second on the low hum of my laptop and my breath. For that tiny beat the catastrophe voice quieted a hair, but then it slammed back so fast — missed deadline, fail the module, lose funding — my chest tightened and I had the urge to start working immediately to stop it. Can we try another step? Go slower, because I get flooded really quickly.

Therapist: You noticed the hum and your breath, and for a second, the disaster voice wasn't as loud. That's really small, but it's something to build on. When you felt the urge to work immediately to stop the disaster story, what happened in your body while you were *thinking* "I need to stop it"?

Patient: My chest clamps and my breath gets shallow, my heart starts pounding like an alarm, and my shoulders hunch up so tight I can feel the knot in my neck. My hands go restless — they itch to open my laptop, type, fix whatever tiny thing might save me — and my mind narrows so hard all I see is the missed deadline spiraling into everything falling apart. The panic makes me rush, make mistakes, and then the catastrophe voice grows louder, like proof I'm already failing. I'm already shaky — can we slow down before the next step?

Therapist: Your body is already responding to the panic, even before you try to push the disaster story away. You're noticing the physical sensations - the clamping chest, the shallow breath, the pounding heart - and the thoughts that come with those feelings. *pause*

Patient: My chest's still tight and my breath's shallow, like my body already decided we're in crisis. The minute I try to sit with that I hear the whole chain — missed deadline → fail module → lose funding — and my hands are already reaching for the laptop to fix it. I'm flooded and skeptical this'll change anything, but I'm willing to try if you slow it down and tell me exactly what to do next.

Therapist: Your body is already responding to the panic, and the thoughts are coming with it. When you say you're willing to try, I want you to notice what's holding you back from making that next step - what's the tiny thing that's stopping you from opening the laptop *right now*, even though you want to fix it?

Patient: I think it's this tiny, stupid fear that if I open the laptop I'll see the mistake or an email proving I've already missed something — and that will make the whole collapse start for real. So I freeze, my hands hover, and part of me won't risk looking because I'm terrified checking will confirm the disaster and because I'm so exhausted I worry fixing it will only make more mistakes. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't picture any other outcome.

Therapist: That makes sense. The fear of seeing the mistake and the exhaustion are showing up together, and they're making it hard to move forward. When you say "I know that sounds extreme," what if you were to notice that thought as just a thought - not as the truth about what will happen if you open the laptop?

Patient: I try that — telling myself "that's just a thought" — but it doesn't stick; it feels like a prophecy instead of a thought. My chest tightens, my hands go restless, and I'm so distracted I can't hold anything else in my head. I don't see how noticing it would change the outcome — can you give me one tiny, concrete step to do right now before I start scrambling to fix everything?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought as just that - a thought - still feels like a small step for a big problem. I'm going to ask you to do something tiny that doesn't change what's happening, but helps you notice it *slightly* more clearly. When you feel the restlessness in your hands, what happens if you *just* notice that tightness - not to fix it, not to stop it, but just to notice it - while you still look at the laptop screen?

Patient: I tried—focusing on the tightness for a beat felt like just a sensation, but my eyes kept darting to the screen like it'll prove the mistake, and the catastrophe voice goes full blast — missed deadline, fail module, lose funding — so my hands start twitching to type. Noticing slips away almost immediately and feels pointless; can you slow down and tell me exactly what to do next? I'm jittery and can't seem to hold it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to what matters - noticing the tightness - but it's slipping away again. I want to try something tiny that might help you hold onto that noticing for just a moment longer. When you feel your hands starting to twitch to type, what would it be like to *pause* just for 1 second - just 1 second - before you start typing? Not to stop the thought, not to change it, but just to notice what happens *right now* when you pause.

Patient: I try to pause, but my hands twitch and my chest clamps up — in that one second the disaster voice rockets: missed deadline, fail module, lose funding — and it feels like I'm holding my breath waiting for the collapse to start. Pausing just makes me more frantic because it feels like I'm delaying the inevitable, not avoiding it. I'm trying to stay with it, but I'm jittery and my attention keeps snapping to the screen — can we go even slower?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the thought of pausing, and like it's making things worse. I'm going to try to help you notice what's happening just beneath the surface of that feeling. When you say your chest is clamping up and your hands are twitching, what's happening *with* that clamping - what does it feel like *in* your body, not just in your thoughts?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing the clamp supposed to help when everything's already racing? Physically it's like a metal band squeezing my chest, my breath gets shallow, my throat tightens, my head goes a bit fuzzy, and my hands twitch as if they have to start typing right this second. The second that happens the disaster voice kicks in — missed deadline → fail module → lose funding — and my eyes just keep darting to the screen; can you slow down and tell me one exact thing to do right now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling completely overwhelmed. I want to try something very simple that might help you notice what's happening just one tiny bit longer. When you feel your hands twitching to type, right now, right this moment, *before* the thought of the disaster voice shows up - what happens if you *just* let your hands rest there, like they're just floating in the air, without moving towards the laptop?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I try to let my hands just float and it lasts maybe a heartbeat before my fingers itch to type and the catastrophe voice screams: missed deadline → fail module → lose funding. When they rest my chest clamps tighter, my breath gets shallow, and it feels like I'm just holding my breath waiting for everything to start falling apart. Go slower — tell me exactly how long to keep them there, because I'm jittery and that pause already feels dangerous.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're on the verge of something very scary. I'm going to try to help you notice what's happening right now, even if it feels like it's not working. When you feel your chest clamping tighter, your breath getting shallow, and your hands twitching to type, *right now*, *in this moment*, *for just 2 seconds* - what happens if you just *let* your chest clamp *be* there, without trying to fix it or make it go away?

Patient: I tried to let it be for two seconds and I only managed maybe one before my hands were already clawing for the keyboard. The clamp felt like a metal band squeezing my ribs, my breath went razor-thin, my vision blurred, and the disaster narrator screamed louder — missed deadline, fail module, lose funding — like pausing made it angrier. I don't see how this helps; please go slower and tell me exactly what to do next because I'm jittery and can't hold more than a beat.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to notice what's happening even for a small moment. I want to try something very tiny that might help. When you feel your chest clamping tighter, your breath getting shallow, and your hands twitching to type - *right now*, *in this exact moment*, *for just a fraction of a second* - what happens if you *notice* the sensation of the metal band *just as it's happening*? Not to change it, not to stop it, but just to notice what it feels like *when it's happening*, like you're looking at it with curiosity?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is looking at the metal band with "curiosity" supposed to stop the collapse that's already queued up? I try to notice it and it's exactly like you said: metal squeezing my ribs, breath razor-thin, vision fuzzing, and the narrator immediately yells "missed deadline → fail module → lose funding" like it's already happened, so my hands start clawing for the laptop and my attention frays (and my phone buzzed which just made me more jittery). Tell me one exact thing to do right now, step by step, because I can't picture how curiosity changes anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like noticing the sensation is just what the narrator is waiting for, and it's making things worse. I want to try something very small that might help you notice what's happening *without* the narrator. Here's what I want you to do: *right now*, *while you're still feeling the metal band squeezing your ribs*, I want you to *ask* yourself: "Is the thought 'I'm going to miss the deadline' *making* this metal band squeeze my ribs?"

Patient: I asked it and…I don't know. Part of me wants to say the thought is making the metal band, but the louder part of me is sure the thought is just narrating something that's already happening. My chest's squeezing harder and my hands are twitching to check the laptop — I can't see how answering that helps, so tell me exactly what to do next, step by step.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the story again. I want to try to help you notice what's happening *without* trying to change it. When you felt the thought "the thought is making the metal band" - what happened *just before* you said that? *Before* you tried to answer the question?

Patient: Right before I tried to answer, the narrator went full blast — the missed-deadline image felt like it had already happened, my chest clamped, breath got razor-thin, and my hands were already trying to hit the laptop. I froze because I couldn't tell if the thought was causing the squeeze or if the squeeze was proof the thought was true, so I just said "I don't know." It felt like the panic answered for me before I had any real chance to think.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to notice what's happening just before the narrator takes over. I want to try to help you notice what happens *just before* the narrator starts talking. When you feel the chest clamping, breath getting shallow, and hands twitching - what happens *just before* the thought "I'm going to miss the deadline" shows up?

Patient: Usually it's a tiny physical thing first — a hollow drop in my stomach and that metal-band squeeze in my chest — like the narrator is loading up. My eyes lock on the nearest cue (blinking cursor, timestamp, email subject) and in a fraction of a second the whole disaster is playing out — missed deadline → fail module → lose funding — like it already happened. Sometimes there’s literally no warning and it just drops in fully formed, and I don't know if noticing any of that will change the outcome, so tell me exactly what to do next.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations before the narrator takes over might be the only chance to intervene. I want to try to help you notice what happens just before the cursor blinks - the moment before your eyes lock on it. What happens *just before* you feel the cursor's presence, the moment before the thoughts start racing?

Patient: Right before the cursor grabs me there's this hollow drop — my stomach goes cold, my vision tunnels to the screen, and my heart pounds like it's warning me. My hands start twitching like they're already typing and the whole disaster movie slides into place in a split second: missed deadline → fail module → lose funding — like it's already happening and I can't stop it. I don't see how noticing that moment changes anything; it just feels like the cue that the collapse has begun.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the hollow drop might be the only moment when you can pause the narrative before it takes over. I want to try to help you notice what happens when you *don't* notice the cursor - when you let the hollow drop be without trying to fix it or stop it. What would happen *if* you just let that feeling of the stomach drop *be*, without trying to change it or prepare for the thoughts?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is letting it "be" supposed to help? When I try that, even for a second the metal band tightens, my breath goes razor-thin, my vision tunnels, and the narrator floods in with the whole collapse: missed deadline → fail module → lose funding. Letting it sit just feels like waiting for the inevitable, which makes me jittery and reach for the laptop faster. Tell me exactly, step-by-step, what I'm supposed to do in that tiny moment, because I can't picture any other outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like letting the feeling be is just what the narrator is waiting for, and it's making things worse. I want to try to help you notice what happens when you *don't* try to change it, but instead *just observe* that feeling - the hollow drop, the tightening chest, the racing thoughts. 

When you feel the thoughts "missing deadline → fail module → lose funding" - what happens *just before* you say that to yourself, without trying to make it true?

Patient: Right before I say it there's that hollow drop in my stomach and everything narrows—the blinking cursor, the timestamp, some tiny memory of screwing up before flashes. My chest clamps, breath gets razor-thin, my hands go restless, and in that split second the narrator just declares the verdict like it's already happened: missed deadline → fail module → lose funding. I'm more jittery and scattered now, and I can't see any other outcome, so I freeze and then lunge to fix it—tell me, step-by-step, what I'm supposed to do in that tiny moment because I can't picture anything different.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught up in the story now. I want to try to help you notice what happens when you *just let go* of the need to fix it - not to change the thoughts or the outcome, but just to notice what happens when you stop trying to control it. 

When you feel the thoughts "missing deadline → fail module → lose funding" - and you notice the hollow drop, the clamping chest, the racing thoughts - what happens *when you say to yourself* "I'm not going to fix it now"?

Patient: When I say "I'm not going to fix it now" it feels like stepping off a cliff — my chest clamps, my stomach drops, and the narrator instantly shouts that I've already missed the deadline and everything's about to collapse. For a brief beat there's a tiny relief, then the voice gets louder like it's punishing me for pausing, and my hands start clawing for the keyboard. It doesn't calm me — it just spikes the panic and convinces me the disaster is already happening, so I end up scrambling harder.
