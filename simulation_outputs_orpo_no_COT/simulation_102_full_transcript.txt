--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early fifties and with the empty-nest thing lately my anxiety's been acting up — especially around social events. The moment I think about seeing friends my brain goes into this 'definitely catastrophic' mode: I'll say something stupid, people will laugh, my partner will be embarrassed, friendships will collapse and I'll end up totally alone. So I keep canceling even though part of me really wants to go.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having that 'definitely catastrophic' thought right before social events feels really overwhelming. When you notice that thought showing up, what's it like for you to try to stay with it – not to change it, but just to notice it as "that's what's happening right now" – while you're also thinking about what matters to you, like reconnecting with friends?

Patient: I try to notice it, but the moment I look at it, my brain launches the whole disaster movie: I picture saying something stupid, everyone laughing, my partner glaring, friendships evaporating — and it feels inevitable, like watching a train I can't stop. Trying to "just notice" actually makes it louder, because I get hooked on the next worst scene and can't stay present. I know you're asking me to hold both the thought and what matters, but honestly that sounds impossible — the catastrophic story feels way more real than any gentle reminder about reconnecting.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice the thought without getting caught up in it, your brain actually makes it feel more present – like the train you can't stop – because you're so focused on trying to avoid the worst-case scenario. That can feel really tough. What if, instead of trying to notice the thought while also doing something about it, you just noticed it while you're standing there – with your partner, at the social event – *while you're still saying yes to going*?

Patient: I wish that sounded doable, but if I try that my brain immediately goes into overdrive. I'll be there saying "yes," then I notice the thought and it jumps to me saying something awkward, someone laughing, my partner looking mortified, people whispering, friendships peeling away and me leaving early humiliated — it's like a movie I can't turn off. The idea of staying with the thought while I actually socialize feels naive to me; the calmer outcomes just seem like pretending, and I get completely hooked on the disaster instead.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice the thought while doing something about it, your brain actually gets even more caught up in the story – like the movie you can't turn off. That makes sense. What if, for just a tiny moment – like a breath – you could actually be with the thought while still being with your partner, and still being willing to show up at the event, without needing to "fix" the thought?

Patient: I get the idea, but even that tiny breath feels like handing my brain a cue to start the whole catastrophe movie — one breath and I'm already saying something stupid, everyone laughing, my partner shrinking away, friendships collapsing and me leaving early. Honestly, it feels like pretending that won't happen; I guess I could try to notice for a breath, but I don't trust myself not to bolt the second the worst-case story shows up.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of even noticing for a breath feels like you're taking a risk – that you won't be able to handle what shows up, and that makes you feel like you'll fail. That's a really tough spot to be in. What matters to you about being able to show up at the event – what matters about connecting with your partner, or being with your friends – would it be possible to think about that, even for just a moment, without needing to notice the thought?

Patient: I do care — I don't want to lose my friends, and I want my partner to know I can still be part of things instead of hiding. But the second I try to hold that, my brain goes full catastrophe: I say something stupid, people laugh, my partner's embarrassed, friendships fall apart and I'm alone. So it feels impossible to think about what matters without the disaster story drowning it out — it just seems like pretending to hope that's all.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold onto what matters – your connection with your partner, your friendships, feeling part of things – the thought of disaster shows up and makes it feel like you're not really doing it, like you're just pretending. That can be a really hard place to be.

Patient: Yeah — I do want the connection, but the minute I picture going my brain locks into the worst-case: I'll say something stupid, people will laugh, my partner will look ashamed, friendships will evaporate — like a movie I can't stop. So I cancel to avoid that humiliation, and then I feel small and guilty afterward. I want to try staying, but I don't trust myself not to bolt the second the "movie" starts.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of connecting with others and feeling like yourself is worth something to you, but the fear of being seen as foolish or embarrassing is what's keeping you from showing up. And then when you do try to show up, the fear of that thought showing up again feels like too much to handle.

Patient: Yeah, that hits it — I want the connection, but the minute I picture it my brain runs the whole disaster: I say something stupid, people laugh, my partner looks embarrassed, friendships evaporate. I'm a manager, I usually fix stuff, but this feels out of my hands and I keep canceling. Can we slow down — how am I supposed to be with that fear without it taking over every time?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make sense of this feeling, like you're wondering how to "be with" the fear without it being too much. When you say "without it taking over," what does that mean to you? Would it be possible to notice the fear while still being able to make a phone call – to connect with your partner, even if the worst-case story shows up?

Patient: To me "without it taking over" means I could still pick up the phone, say what I need to, and not freeze or bolt — staying connected even with the fear there. But honestly I don't think I can: the second I try to notice it, my brain goes into the full movie — I'll say something stupid on the call, my partner will be mortified, it'll go awkward and then things will fray — and that feels inevitable. I feel stuck between wanting to reach out and being terrified that noticing the fear guarantees the disaster.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice the fear, it's like you're putting a sign on the door that says "danger, stay away." And that makes sense – it feels like noticing the fear would make it inevitable. But what if, instead of trying to keep the door closed, you could just put your finger on the doorknob – just for a moment – and say, "I'm going to open this door and see what's on the other side"?

Patient: I want to try that, but even just touching the doorknob feels like the start button on the movie — I see myself open it, blurt something stupid, everyone laughing, my partner embarrassed, friendships fraying and me leaving humiliated. It feels inevitable, like one tiny move and the whole disaster is rolling, so I don't trust myself to "just look" without it exploding. Can we slow down? I need help figuring out how to be with that without everything going off.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of even touching the doorknob is like a trigger that sets off the whole movie. When you say "without it exploding," what does that mean to you? Would it be possible to notice what happens when you touch the doorknob – not because you're trying to stop the movie, but because you're curious about what's already happening –

Patient: I try to be curious, but the second I even imagine touching the doorknob it turns into gasoline on the fire — I see myself blurt something stupid, everyone laughing, my partner shrinking away, friendships snapping, and I'm fleeing with my face burning. My body reacts: heart pounding, throat tight, voice going thin, my mind just replaying the worst scene on loop, so "noticing" just amps the movie. Curiosity feels naive — I don't trust that I can watch it without being pulled in. Can we slow down? I need help figuring out one tiny thing I could actually try without everything exploding.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of even imagining touching the doorknob is like adding fuel to the fire, making the whole disaster feel even more real. When you say "I don't trust that I can watch it without being pulled in," what if that trust wasn't about the thought itself, but about what would happen *while* you're noticing – not about being able to control the movie, but about being able to stay with the feeling while you're doing something small?

Patient: I get what you're saying, but if the trust is about "staying with it" I still see the whole movie start — one small move and I'm blurting something awful, everyone laughing, my partner shrinking away, friendships gone. It feels impossible to believe I could stay with the feeling and still do anything, so can we slow down — give me one tiny, concrete step I could try that doesn't feel like hitting the start button on the disaster?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Let's try something really small. When you're holding that phone to call your partner, what would it take for you to simply *put the phone down* for one second – not to do anything about it, just to make that tiny move of putting it down?

Patient: I don't think I can — even putting the phone down for one second feels like hitting "start" on the disaster movie. My hands are shaking, my heart's racing, and my mind immediately sees it: I set it down, it slips or I fumble, my partner thinks I'm careless, people judge, and everything snowballs. Can we slow down — tell me one tiny, exact physical step (which hand, where to put it) because if it's even a little vague my brain will run the whole script.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: when you're holding the phone to call your partner, what if you simply *move your right hand* – not to pick up the phone, just to move it – to place it gently on the table beside the phone, with your palm facing down? That's the only movement – not to do anything about it, just to make that tiny physical change.

Patient: Okay, I can try that—but my heart's already pounding and my hand's shaky, and the moment I think about moving it I see my fingers fumbling, knocking the phone or a glass, everyone noticing and thinking I'm clumsy, my partner embarrassed, the whole night derailing. Tell me exactly where on the table to place it and how far from the phone, because if it's even a little vague my brain will run the whole movie. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: place your right hand exactly *2.5 inches* away from the phone, on the edge of the table, with the back of your hand resting flat against the table, and your fingers curled gently over the edge. That's the only movement – not to do anything about it, just to make that tiny physical change.

Patient: Okay — I tried to place my right hand 2.5 inches from the phone with the back flat and fingers over the edge, but my hand is shaking so much my mind immediately sees it slip, knock the phone or a glass, everyone looking and laughing, my partner mortified, friendships fraying — like it already happened. My mind's racing and I'm so distracted I can't stop replaying that scene, so I don't trust that this tiny move won't set the whole thing off. Can we slow down — tell me exactly what to do if my hand slips, because I feel like I'll freeze or bolt the second that happens.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: if your hand slips or moves even a tiny bit while you're placing it 2.5 inches from the phone, what would happen *exactly* – not to your mind's story, but to what's actually happening right now? What would it feel like to notice that your hand slipped, and then *what* would you do with that feeling?

Patient: If my hand slipped, the actual thing would probably be a tiny jolt — a catch in my breath, my fingers trembling, my heart kicking, my throat tightening and my face going hot. I'd yank my hand back, maybe blurt something like "sorry," and my body would want to pull away or leave. But the second that happens my mind turns that tiny slip into the whole movie — everyone laughing, my partner mortified, friendships broken — so I usually just freeze or make an excuse to get out. Can we slow down — tell me exactly what you'd want me to do in that moment so I don't just bolt?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: Let's try this: if your hand slips, and you notice the tiny jolt in your breath, your fingers trembling, your heart kicking, your throat tightening, and your face going hot – what if you *allowed* that feeling, without trying to fix it or make excuses? What if you simply *made room* for that feeling, so it doesn't push you away from reaching for your partner?

Patient: I try to "allow" it but the second I do the movie just flips into overdrive — I can hear the laughter, I blurt something awful, my partner looks embarrassed and everything falls apart. It brings up this familiar, burning shame like I always screw things up, and then my whole body wants to run. Can we slow down — tell me exactly, step by step, what to do with that hot shame and the pounding in my chest when it starts so I don't bolt.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: when that burning shame shows up in your chest, and your body starts to want to run – notice that *first* – without trying to change it. Just notice the shame, like a *small, hot flame* in your chest. What happens to the flame when you make room for it – *just for a tiny moment* – without trying to push it away or make excuses?

Patient: When I try to make room, that little flame already feels like gasoline — in one breath it roars into this burning shame that "proves" I always mess up. My heart spikes, my throat closes, my mouth goes dry and I can already hear the laughter and my partner's face going pale, so making room feels like giving the movie permission to start. I can't just hang with it — I need one exact, tiny step (how long to breathe, what to do with my hands, what to say if someone notices) or I'll bolt. Can we slow down and make that step ridiculously specific?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: when the shame starts to roar in your chest, and your heart spikes, your throat closes, and your mouth goes dry – notice that *first*, for just *2 seconds*. As soon as you notice the shame, take *ONE* deep breath into your body, feeling the breath move into your chest, and then *exhale* slowly, noticing where the breath leaves your body.

Patient: I tried that — I noticed the shame for a beat, took a breath, and my chest just seized and the whole disaster movie flooded back; it feels like this old, burning shame that proves I always mess up. I could do a breath but my mind immediately jumps to everyone laughing and me bolting. I need you to tell me exactly how many seconds to inhale and exhale, where to rest my hands, and a short phrase I can say to myself if someone notices, because vague stuff just lets the movie start. Can we slow down and make that step ridiculously, painfully specific?


--- Turn 18 ---

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: Let's try this: when the shame starts to roar in your chest, and your chest seizes, notice that *for exactly 4 seconds*. As soon as you notice the shame, take *a 2-second inhale*, feeling the breath move into your chest, and then *a 2-second exhale*, noticing where the breath leaves your body. While you're exhaling, gently *rest your right hand on your left knee*, with your palm facing down, and your fingers curled gently over the edge. If someone notices, you can say to yourself *"I'm here"*, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone, without trying to change it.

Patient: I tried it — I noticed the shame for the four seconds, did a 2-second inhale and 2-second exhale, rested my right hand on my left knee and barely mouthed "I'm here" — and within that breath the shame flared into that old, burning proof that I always screw up and the disaster movie rushed back. My hand was shaking, my chest slammed, and I almost yanked it away; the phrase felt tiny and fake compared to the images of everyone laughing and my partner looking humiliated. Can we slow down — tell me exactly whether to count the seconds out loud or silently, where to look while I do it, what to do with my left hand, and give me a concrete sentence to say if someone actually notices so I don't bolt, because vague stuff just lets the movie start.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: as you're doing the 2-second inhale and 2-second exhale, *count the seconds silently*, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. While you're counting, *look down at your left hand*, noticing how it's shaking, and *gently squeeze the fingers together* for a moment, without trying to stop the shaking. If someone notices, you can say to yourself *"I notice you're looking at me"* in a calm, matter-of-fact tone, without trying to change it.

Patient: I tried that — I counted silently, stared at my left hand and squeezed my fingers, and mouthed "I notice you're looking at me," but the shame exploded and the whole movie flooded back: heart racing, hands shaking, head jerking to the worst scene, and I nearly ripped my hand away. I'm really jittery and distracted now and I don't trust that tiny phrase — can we slow down? Tell me exactly how many seconds to hold the squeeze, whether I should keep looking at my hand or glance up (and when), what to do with my right hand, and give me one concrete, short sentence to say out loud if someone actually looks at me so I don't just bolt.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: as you're saying *"I notice you're looking at me"*, *hold the squeeze on your left hand for exactly 1 second*, noticing how it feels to hold that tension. While you're holding the squeeze, *glance up at the person looking at you* for just a brief moment, and then *quickly look back down at your left hand*. Keep doing that squeeze for another *2 seconds*, noticing how it feels to hold that tension. If someone notices you're doing this, you can say out loud *"I'm here"* – just say it clearly and matter-of-factly, without trying to change it.

Patient: I tried it — I squeezed for a second, glanced up and said "I'm here" out loud, but my hands were shaking so badly my voice came out thin and that old burning shame slammed back in; within seconds I'm already picturing everyone laughing and me bolting. I'm really jittery and distracted now and I don't trust that tiny script — tell me exactly how loud and how long to say "I'm here" (a whisper, normal voice, or louder?), what to do if my voice cracks, where to put my right hand while saying it, and what to do with my feet if I feel like running, because vague stuff just makes the movie start. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Let's try this: when you say *"I'm here"*, *use a normal voice*, not a whisper or a loud shout. Say it in a calm, steady tone, like you're telling the truth to yourself. *Keep your right hand still, resting it gently on your left knee* while you say it. If your voice cracks, *don't try to change it*, just keep going. You can say *"I'm here"* again, and again, if you need to. If you feel like running, *just notice the feeling* and keep your feet where they are. You don't have to move – just stay with the phrase and the sensation in your body.

Patient: I tried it — I said "I'm here" in a normal voice with my right hand on my knee, but my voice still cracked and that old burning shame hit me so hard I could see everyone laughing, my partner shrinking away, and me already bolting. I need this painfully specific: how many times exactly should I say it, how many seconds to keep my hand on my knee, should I look at one person or down, and what exactly do I do if my voice cracks or someone actually laughs — because if you leave any of it vague my brain will start the whole disaster movie. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're really struggling with this. Let's try to break it down even further. When you say *"I'm here"*, *say it exactly 3 times*, in a normal voice, with your right hand still on your left knee. *Keep your eyes down at the floor* while you say it, so you don't have to look at anyone. *Hold that gaze for exactly 5 seconds* after each time you say it. If your voice cracks, *don't try to fix it*, just keep going. You can say *"I'm here"* again, and again, if you need to. *If someone laughs*, *just notice it* and keep saying *"I'm here"*. You can say it again, and again, if you need to.

Patient: I tried it and my voice still cracked — that old burning shame hit me so hard I could see everyone laughing, my partner shrinking away, and I wanted to bolt. I need this crazily specific: exactly how many seconds between each "I'm here," should I breathe between them (how long?), how loud is a "normal voice" — like a 3/10 or 6/10 on volume? — where exactly to put my feet if they want to run, what to do if someone actually laughs or my partner makes a face, and whether I should tell my partner beforehand so they don't get embarrassed; please slow down, I can't do any of this vaguely.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're really struggling with this. Let's try to break it down even further. When you say *"I'm here"*, *say it exactly 3 times*, in a normal voice, which feels like a 4/10 volume to you. *Pause for exactly 1 second* between each time you say it, so you can breathe deeply and feel the words. *Take a deep breath in for 2 seconds* before you say the first *"I'm here"*, and then *exhale slowly for 2 seconds* before you say the second one. *Keep your right hand still on your left knee* and your eyes down at the floor while you say it. *If someone laughs or your partner makes a face*, *just notice it and keep saying *"I'm here"* without changing your voice or breathing. *If you feel like running*, *don't move your feet*, just keep your weight on them where they are. *Don't tell your partner beforehand*, just do it when they're looking at you, so you can see how they react to the phrase.

Patient: I tried picturing doing all that, but even imagining saying "I'm here" three times flips the switch — my voice cracks, I see everyone laughing, my partner looking ashamed, friendships snapping. I need it insanely specific: count out loud or silently? Exactly how should my feet be planted (heels together, shoulder-width)? Should I look down at the floor or at my lap the whole time? If my voice cracks or someone laughs, do I keep eyes down and keep saying it, or pause and breathe for exactly how many seconds? Can we slow down — I can't do any of this unless you tell me each tiny move step-by-step, because otherwise the movie starts and I bolt.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're really struggling with this. Let's try to break it down even further. When you say *"I'm here"*, *say it exactly 3 times*, in a normal voice, which feels like a 4/10 volume to you. *Count out loud*: "ONE, two, three". *Pause for exactly 1 second* between each time you say it, so you can breathe deeply and feel the words. *Take a deep breath in for 2 seconds* before you say the first *"I'm here"*, and then *exhale slowly for 2 seconds* before you say the second one. *Take another deep breath in for 2 seconds* before you say the third one. *Keep your right hand still on your left knee* and your eyes down at your *lap* the whole time, not on the floor. *If someone laughs or your voice cracks*, *pause for exactly 3 seconds* and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. *Then, without changing your voice or breathing*, *keep saying *"I'm here"* again. *Keep your feet planted with your heels *together* and your weight evenly distributed on both feet.

Patient: I tried to picture doing all that but my heart's racing, I'm jittery and distracted, that burning shame jumps in and my voice already cracks — can we slow down? Okay, painfully specific Qs: when you say "count out loud: ONE, two, three" — is that sequence said once before the three "I'm here"s, or do I say "ONE" then "I'm here", "two" then "I'm here", "three" then "I'm here"? Also, do I say the 1-second pauses out loud or silently, exactly when do I do each 2‑second inhale/exhale (before which "I'm here"s), and what exactly do I do if my partner talks or someone laughs mid-sequence — freeze and keep the feet planted and keep saying the phrase, or pause then resume? Can we slow down and walk through it step-by-step, numbered?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're really struggling with this. Let's try to break it down even further. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. *Before you say the first "I'm here"*, *take a deep breath in for 2 seconds*. This means you'll inhale slowly and deeply, feeling the air move into your body.
2. *While you're inhaling*, *count out loud*: "ONE". Say the number "ONE" clearly, without stopping or hesitating. This is just one step, and it's not related to the "I'm here" yet.
3. *After you exhale the 2 seconds*, *say the first "I'm here"*. This means you'll release the breath slowly, and then say the phrase "I'm here" clearly, without pausing or hesitating.
4. *Immediately after saying the first "I'm here"*, *pause for exactly 1 second*. This means you'll stop speaking, and just notice the pause. You don't need to count this out loud; you can silently notice the pause.
5. *After the 1-second pause*, *count out loud*: "two". Say the number "two" clearly, without stopping or hesitating. This is just one step, and it's not related to the "I'm here" yet.
6. *While you're inhaling again*, *say the second "I'm here"*. This means you'll release the breath slowly, and then say the phrase "I'm here" clearly, without pausing or hesitating.
7. *Immediately after saying the second "I'm here"*, *pause for exactly 1 second*. This means you'll stop speaking, and just notice the pause. You don't need to count this out loud; you can silently notice the pause.
8. *After the 1-second pause*, *count out loud*: "three". Say the number "three" clearly, without stopping or hesitating. This is the final step.
9. *Immediately after saying the third "I'm here"*, *pause for exactly 1 second*. This means you'll stop speaking, and just notice the pause. You don't need to count this out loud; you can silently notice the pause.

What if someone talks or laughs mid-sequence? *Take a deep breath in*, *pause for exactly 3 seconds*, *and then resume*. If you feel like freezing, *don't*. Just notice the pause,

Patient: Okay — I heard the steps, but my chest's already tight and that old shame's creeping in, like proof I always mess up, so this feels overwhelming. If I feel like freezing, my brain immediately sees the whole movie — I bolt, or stammer, or everyone laughs — so I need you to keep going but in tiny numbered steps starting exactly from "If you feel like freezing..." Tell me, step‑by‑step, what to do with my feet, where to breathe, how many seconds to wait, and exactly when to resume the sequence so I don't accidentally hit "start" on the disaster. Can we slow down?
