Patient: Hi, I'm in my late twenties and I work as a software developer. Lately I've been avoiding gatherings with my few close friends because social situations make me really anxious. With my generalized anxiety and ongoing family conflict, it's been getting worse, and I guess... I don't know, it's just hard to talk about.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure building up for you. When you think about gathering with friends, what's the first thought that shows up for you when your anxiety starts to rise?

Patient: I guess the first thought is something like, “What if I say something dumb and they all notice?” I don't know, it quickly turns into this feeling like everyone's watching me and I'll mess everything up. It's kind of embarrassing to say out loud.

Therapist: So that "what if" thought is already happening, even before you're in the gathering. When you notice that thought showing up, what would it be like if you could make space for it, just for a moment – not to stop it, but to notice it while you're still standing there with your friends?

Patient: I guess if I tried to make space for it, it'd feel weird — like holding something hot and not throwing it away. I don't know, I'd probably notice my heart racing and the thought “they're judging me,” and maybe I'd be able to say I'm nervous, but honestly I'd likely try to joke or change the subject because it feels too uncomfortable.

Therapist: That makes sense – it sounds like trying to make space for that thought feels like holding onto something painful, even if it's just for a moment. And when you think about trying to joke or change the subject, what would happen if you could just let that thought be there, even while you're talking to your friends?

Patient: I guess if I let it be there, maybe the panic wouldn't spike as badly — I don't know, like it might feel less urgent. But it also feels really exposed, like I'm standing naked in front of everyone, so I'd probably try to cover it with a joke or steer the conversation away, or make an excuse to leave. I'm not trying to be difficult, I just... I don't know, it's uncomfortable to even think about saying that out loud.

Therapist: It sounds like even the thought of letting that thought be there is hard for you, because it feels like it's still connected to the discomfort of being judged or exposed. Can you notice what happens when you try to make an excuse to leave – what would it be like to stay with that feeling for just a moment, even if it's hard, and then see what showing up might look like when you're still standing there with your friends?

Patient: I guess when I start to make an excuse my chest gets tight and my brain goes kind of fuzzy — I don't know, I start rehearsing a line to get out. If I tried to stay for even a moment I'd probably still feel exposed and want to cover it with a joke, but maybe... I don't know, maybe noticing it could make it less intense, and that scares me to try.

Therapist: It sounds like making an excuse is a way for you to avoid the feeling of exposure and tightness in your chest. And when you think about noticing that feeling and staying for a moment, it feels scary because it might still be there – even if it's not as intense. But what if, instead of trying to cover it up, you could actually notice what it would be like to be with that feeling while still being present with your friends?

Patient: I guess if I actually tried that, I'd notice the tightness and the thought that everyone's judging me, and probably feel like I'm about to melt. I don't know, part of me thinks if I stayed it might shrink instead of exploding, but another part just wants to get out and make a joke. It's really uncomfortable to imagine doing it for real, and I don't know where to start.

Therapist: It sounds like there's a sense of "this is what it means to be overwhelmed" that's really hard to shake – the feeling of melting, of being consumed by the thought and the tightness. And when you think about staying with it, you're right that it feels like it could "explode" – but what if, instead of trying to avoid that explosion, you could actually notice what would happen if you stayed with it just for a tiny moment – just long enough to wonder what it would be like to be with that feeling while still being present with your friends?

Patient: I guess if I stayed even a tiny moment the tightness might loosen a bit instead of exploding, but I don't know—I'm scared it'd just snowball and I'd panic. It's really hard to imagine actually trying it without making a joke or slipping out, so... can we talk about small, doable steps for trying that in a way that doesn't feel like diving off a cliff?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about taking a step that feels too big. What if, instead of trying to stay with the tightness forever, you could try just noticing it for one tiny breath – while you're still standing there with your friends? Like, what would it be like to notice it for just one breath, and then breathe out, and then wonder what would happen if you noticed it again for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay, I can try that for one breath. I take a breath and notice my chest tighten and the thought “they're judging me” pop up — I don't know, it actually felt a tiny bit less sharp after I exhaled, but I'm still on edge and want to make a joke or slip away. I guess maybe I could try another breath, but I'm not sure how to keep going without freaking out.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that tiny bit less sharpness after the breath was still a small step, and it's okay that it didn't completely go away. What if, instead of trying to make a joke or slip away, you could just notice what it would be like to keep that tiny bit of space between you and the tightness – even if it's just for another breath?

Patient: I guess I can try another breath. When I do it, my chest loosens for a second but then my brain's already drafting an excuse to leave or a joke to cover it up. I don't know how to make that tiny pause actually stick in a real hangout — can we break it down into even smaller steps or a simple thing I can actually do when I'm there?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny pause is still happening quickly, and your brain is already jumping ahead to the next plan. What if, instead of trying to change your whole experience, you could just notice what you're doing when that pause happens – like, "Oh, my brain's already making that excuse, but I notice it's happening again." That tiny awareness might be enough to make the pause feel a little bigger.

Patient: I guess I can try noticing it — like thinking “oh, my brain’s already making an excuse” — and it does make the pause feel a little bigger. I don't know, it still feels scary and I usually end up freezing or cracking a joke in real life; can we come up with one tiny, specific thing I can actually do or say in that moment so it doesn't feel like diving off a cliff?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that thought is making the pause feel bigger, but you're still worried about what happens next. What if, in that moment when you notice your brain's excuse, you could just say something tiny – like, "Hey, I notice that thought. It's showing up again." Or, "I'm noticing my chest tightness right now." That small acknowledgment might make the pause feel a little more solid, and you might be surprised at what happens next.

Patient: I guess I could try saying that, but it feels really embarrassing and shameful — like I'm admitting I messed up — and that just spikes the tension. I don't know, I worry they'd think I'm weak, so I end up joking or slipping away. Can we do a tiny role-play? Give me one super-short line (like under five words) I can actually say so it doesn't feel like confessing.

Therapist: Let's try something small. Here's a line: "I'm here with you." Just say that with them, and see what happens.

Patient: I guess... I'm here with you.

Therapist: It sounds like just saying that one small line didn't make you feel like you're admitting to a huge mistake. What happened when you said it?

Patient: I guess saying "I'm here with you" gave me a tiny loosen — like a brief relief — but then I got that flush of embarrassment and felt like I'd just admitted some huge mistake. My brain started replaying that one screw‑up and I got frustrated and kind of drained, so I don't know how to keep going from there. Can we try another super‑small line I could actually use when it spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny loosen was quickly replaced by another feeling. What if, when that flush came up, you could just notice it again – like, "Oh, my face is flushing right now." That small acknowledgment might make the flush feel a little less overwhelming. And then, what if you could say something tiny like, "I'm still here with you"?

Patient: I guess when I notice the flush and say "I'm still here with you," it loosens for a second, but then that screw‑up replay hits and I get this hot shame and it just drains me — I don't know, it makes everything feel heavier. Can you give me one more really tiny line, like two or three words, I can actually say when that shame spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting stuck in that cycle. What if, when that shame hits, you could just say "I'm noticing it"? That small line might help you stay with the feeling instead of trying to change it.

Patient: I guess I could try saying "I'm noticing it"... but when that shame floods in I just freeze and it feels really draining. I don't know—can we try one even shorter, like a single word I won't feel ridiculous saying?

Therapist: What if you could say just "Yes"?

Patient: I guess "Yes" could work — it's short and not awkward. But it still makes me feel exposed and stupid, and then that shame hits and drains me so I worry I'll just freeze or make a joke. I don't know... can we try one more tiny option, like "Here"?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "Here" might be a small enough step that you could try it even when the shame comes up. When you say "Here," what would it be like if you just stayed with that one word for a moment, without trying to change it or move away?

Patient: I guess if I say "Here" and actually hold it, it feels like a tiny anchor for a second — like something to grab onto — but then that screw‑up replay pops back up and I get this hot shame and everything just drains. I don't know how to keep holding it without freezing or turning it into a joke.

Therapist: It sounds like "Here" is a tiny anchor that helps you feel more grounded for a moment. When the screw-up replay comes up and the shame hits, what if you could just notice it again – like "Oh, that shame is showing up again" – and then *while noticing that* you could say "Here"?

Patient: I guess I could try that — notice the shame and then say "Here." But when I imagine it, that replay hits and I just feel stupid and sort of frozen, like everything gets heavy. I don't know... can we make it even smaller? Tell me one tiny, exact step I can do so I don't blank out.

Therapist: What if, when you notice the shame *just for a second* before it hits, you could *just say* "Here"?

Patient: I guess if I actually noticed it for a second and said "Here," it might anchor me for a breath — but then that flash of that failure pops up and I feel hot, stupid, and everything just drains. I don't know how to stop the replay. Maybe… could it be saying "Here" and then doing one slow exhale? I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like that small step of saying "Here" and doing a slow exhale might actually be possible for you. When you try it, what would it be like to notice the shame for just a second, say "Here," and then *while saying "Here"* breathe out slowly – just for a tiny bit of time, like 4 seconds?

Patient: I guess if I actually try that — notice the shame for a second, say "Here," and breathe out for four seconds — it loosens a little, like a tiny gap. But then that replay of that screw‑up hits and I feel hot, stupid, and everything kind of drains out of me. I don't know how to stop it from taking over; can we do one more tiny step I can do right after the exhale?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny gap matters to you. What if, right after you breathe out for 4 seconds and the shame comes up, you could *just notice* it – like "Oh, that's what's showing up now" – without trying to change it or move away?

Patient: I guess if I actually noticed it and thought, “Oh, that’s showing up,” it might make the shame a hair less sharp for a moment. But then that replay hits and I feel so stupid and everything just kind of drains out of me, so I don't know how to keep going with it.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame and thinking "Oh, that's showing up" helps a tiny bit, but then the replay comes back strong. What if, right after that thought, you could *just pause* for a tiny moment – not trying to change it or move away, just *pausing* – before it hits you again?

Patient: I guess I could try pausing for a second, but when I do this hot shame and frustration rush in and I just freeze. I don't know how to actually hold the pause without turning it into a joke or bolting. Can we pick one tiny exact cue—like count to two or tap my thumb—because I'm kind of worn out just thinking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to hold the pause. What if, when you notice that hot shame and frustration rising up, you could *just tap your *left* thumb on the table for a tiny second – just one second – before it hits you again?

Patient: I guess I can try tapping my left thumb for a second, but when that shame rushes up I just freeze and the screw‑up replay takes over and I feel stupid and drained. I don't know—if I can't tap openly, can I just press my thumb into my palm or tap under the table? Can we try practicing it here once?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck with the physical cues. What if, when you notice that shame rising up, you could *just press your left thumb into your palm for a tiny second* – not trying to tap anywhere else, just the palm of your hand?

Patient: I guess I'll try it — pressing my left thumb into my palm now. It did slow me for a second, but then that replay hit and I felt this hot shame and kind of drained, so... I don't know, can we try it again?

Therapist: It sounds like pressing your thumb into your palm gave you a tiny moment of slowing down. What if, when that replay hits again – and it will, because it's been there before – you could *just stay with that feeling for a tiny bit longer* before it starts to move again?

Patient: I guess I could try staying a tiny bit longer, but when that replay hits I just get hot and feel stupid and everything drains out of me. I don't know how to actually hold it—can you guide me through one tiny extra second right now?

Therapist: Let's try this together. When that replay hits and you feel the hot shame and frustration, I want you to notice it for one *single* second – just that one second – before it moves again. And in that *one second*, I want you to *just press your thumb into your palm* – not trying to change it, not trying to move away, just *pressing into your palm* – while noticing the replay *right there* for just one second. Can you do that with me?

Patient: Okay... I pressed my left thumb into my palm for that one second. It did slow me a bit, but then the hot shame slammed back and I felt kind of stupid and drained. I don't know—can you guide me through doing it one more time, like count it with me?
