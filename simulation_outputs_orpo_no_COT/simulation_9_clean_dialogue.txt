Patient: Hi, I'm a young chef and lately I've been stuck in this loop where I compulsively seek reassurance to blunt the uncomfortable feelings my OCD triggers, especially when financial stress ratchets up the uncertainty. I can describe the behavior in clinical terms—maladaptive affect regulation, interpersonal dependency—but that feels safer than actually sitting with the underlying fear or shame.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that urge to seek reassurance, you're trying to protect yourself from what feels like an unbearable part of your experience—those "uncomfortable feelings" that your OCD triggers. 

What would it be like if, for just a moment, you could make room for that feeling without trying to "fix" it or make it go away?

Patient: Theoretically, making room would function like a kind of exposure—allowing interoceptive tolerance to build and the compulsion to extinguish—but in practice it feels like intentionally inviting a tidal wave of shame and uncertainty that I don't trust myself to survive. So I tend to translate it into an abstract problem—cognitive frameworks, contingencies, risk assessments—because that's manageable compared to the raw, nauseating panic under it. If I tried to actually stay with it, I'm guessing it'd feel disorienting and small-ness-inducing, and I'm not sure how long I'd last without grabbing for reassurance.

Therapist: It sounds like the act of making room for that feeling feels like standing at the edge of a cliff, where the uncertainty and shame are so intense that you're not sure you'd be able to catch yourself. 

When you try to step back from that—instead of using cognitive frameworks to understand it—you notice that it feels like a matter of not knowing what would happen if you stayed with it, rather than what would happen if you didn't.

Patient: Yeah—it's that intolerable epistemic uncertainty more than any specific thought; reassurance gives a fleeting epistemic closure that quiets the salience network for a minute. If I try not to check, there's this visceral churn—tight chest, nausea—but I mostly describe it as autonomic arousal and catastrophic simulation because that's safer than saying "I'm scared." I get, abstractly, that exposure/toleration would help, but I don't have the scaffolding or trust to actually sit in it—how do you even start building that scaffolding without my defaulting to reassurance?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to acknowledge that fear—that "I'm scared"—it gets lost in the need to protect yourself from it, so you turn to the familiar story of catastrophic simulation. 

What if, for just a moment, you could notice that fear while still wanting to stay with it, not to fix it or make it go away, but just to see what it feels like while you're still here in your body?

Patient: Conceptually, sure—it's like a micro interoceptive exposure—but practically it feels like appointing myself as an unreliable witness to a tidal wave of panic. When I try, I immediately defuse into analysis—calling it "autonomic arousal"—because actually saying "I'm scared" feels unbearably raw. Can you give me a concrete, time-limited step—like noticing the feeling for thirty seconds—so I can try it without immediately spiraling into reassurance-seeking?

Therapist: I want to try something small with you. 

For the next 30 seconds, notice the sensation in your chest when you say to yourself, "I'm scared." Not the story about what's happening or how to fix it, just the sensation itself. When you notice it, stay with that feeling for 30 seconds, and do nothing else. Not try to make it go away, not try to understand it, just notice it.

Patient: I tried it — for maybe ten seconds I could actually notice this tight, prickly pressure in my chest and my breath got shallow, and then my brain immediately pivoted into taxonomy mode, labeling it as "autonomic arousal" and simulating catastrophic outcomes. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by how quickly the urge to seek reassurance kicks in when I try to stay with it, and I default to analysis to avoid the rawness. Can we slow down — maybe try a shorter window (10 seconds) or give me a concrete anchor to tether to while I attempt this?

Therapist: It sounds like your brain is really good at finding a way to move away from that feeling quickly. 

Let's try something even smaller. For 10 seconds, notice the sensation in your chest when you say to yourself, "I'm scared." As soon as you notice it, notice your breath. Just notice where your breath is in your body, not what it's doing, just what it feels like to be with it.

Patient: I managed maybe six seconds before my mind hijacked it—there was this prickly pressure high in my chest and my breath felt lodged under the sternum, then I immediately relabeled it as "autonomic arousal" and started simulating outcomes. I'm getting tugged straight toward reassurance again, so can we try another 10-second trial but with a concrete tether—like me pressing my thumb and forefinger together and counting each inhale aloud—so I have something to stay with instead of defaulting to analysis?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really good at finding a way to move away from that feeling again. 

Let's try that 10-second trial with the concrete tether. As soon as you notice the prickly pressure in your chest, notice your breath, and then notice your hands. Press your thumb and forefinger together, and count each inhale aloud to yourself. "Inhale..." as you press your fingers together, and then "exhale..." as your chest feels the pressure. Just notice your hands and the counting, and try to stay with that for 10 seconds.

Patient: I did it — pressed my thumb and forefinger and counted each inhale; got about seven seconds before my mind hijacked it with probabilistic rumination and epistemic closure-seeking. The tactile anchor helped a little, but the chest tightness stayed and I'm getting this strong urge to ask for reassurance. Can we try a 5-second tether, or could you count with me out loud so I have something external to hang onto and don't slip back into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try the 5-second tether. I'll count with you. Here we go: "1...inhale..." as you press your fingers together... "2...exhale..." when you feel the pressure in your chest... "3..." when you notice your breath moving... "4..." when you feel your fingers pressing together... "5..."

Just focus on the counting and the feeling of your fingers pressing together. Try to stay with that for just a few seconds.

Patient: I got through the full five seconds—pressing my fingers and hearing you count helped; the prickly pressure in my chest eased a notch and my breath felt a bit less lodged, but the reassurance impulse stayed loud and immediately translated into catastrophic forecasting about money. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by how quickly my brain reverts to analysis—labeling it as "autonomic arousal" instead of saying "I'm scared"—and that frustrates me. Can we do another short trial, maybe another 5-second set where I say "I'm here" on the exhales so I have something vocal to hang onto instead of slipping back into rumination?

Therapist: It sounds like that brief moment of connection with your fingers and the counting helped, even if the reassurance impulse was still there. 

Let's try another 5-second trial with the new anchor. Here we go: "1...inhale..." as you press your fingers together... "2...exhale..." when you say "I'm here..." out loud... "3..." when you feel your breath moving... "4..." when you notice your fingers pressing together... "5..."

Just focus on saying "I'm here" on the exhales, and try to stay with that for a few seconds.

Patient: I got through the five seconds — saying "I'm here" on the exhales and the finger-press helped a notch; the prickly pressure in my chest eased a little. Almost immediately though my cognitive machinery turned it into a hypothesis-testing ritual, and the reassurance urge morphed into this urgent need to validate financial safety externally. I'm frustrated and a bit shaky; can we try a three-second tether with you counting aloud while I repeat "I'm here" on each exhale, and then a quick strategy for what to do when the urge to ask for reassurance spikes?

Therapist: It sounds like that brief moment of connection helped, but your brain is still trying to protect you. 

Let's try the 3-second tether. Here we go: "1...inhale..." *counting*... "2...exhale...I'm here..." *counting*... "3...exhale...I'm here..." *counting*

As you focus on saying "I'm here" on each exhale, notice what happens when the urge to ask for reassurance spikes. When that happens, what's the first thing that usually shows up—like checking your phone or talking to someone? What would it take to notice that urge without acting on it for just a tiny moment, like 1 second?

Patient: Usually it starts as this verification loop — a rapid internal script that urges me to check my phone, reread bank notifications, or ping someone for reassurance so the uncertainty feels momentarily resolved. To catch it for one second I think I need an external interrupt: a pre-set cue (your voice counting, an alarm), a tactile anchor (thumb+finger), or a rehearsed micro-rule I say to myself like “pause — label — breathe one.” That tiny gap feels like it needs scaffolding because otherwise my default is immediate enactment, and honestly that terrifies me and frustrates me at the same time.

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified the verification loop and the need for an external interrupt to catch it. 

Let's try to build on that. What if, instead of relying on the external interrupt to "catch" it, you could use that tiny gap to do something else entirely? Like, what if, when the urge to verify starts, you simply said to yourself "I'm here" on the exhale, and then... you took one small step towards what matters most to you?

Patient: That actually resonates — conceptually it redirects the verification impulse into behavioral activation/experiential counterconditioning instead of epistemic closure. A concrete micro-step that feels doable: on the exhale say "I'm here," then do a single, two-minute task that matters to me — like wash one pan, chop one herb, or open my budgeting app and log one transaction — something actionable that doesn't promise certainty. I'm anxious I'll still default to reassurance, so I need external scaffolding (you counting or a short timer) and a micro-rule I can rehearse: "pause — label — do two minutes." Can we try that now with you counting while I do the two-minute chop or log?

Therapist: It sounds like you've identified a concrete micro-step that aligns with what matters to you, and you're willing to take action despite the anxiety. 

Let's try it now. On the exhale, say "I'm here." *counting*... *pause*... When you're ready, I'll start counting again. *begin counting* "1...".

Patient: "1...I'm here." Okay—I started chopping the herb like you suggested; the tactile rhythm is mildly stabilizing and that prickly chest pressure eased a bit, but the verification impulse is still humming in the background and my mind keeps want­ing to translate it into a budget-check experiment. I'm frustrated and a little shaky because the analytical reflex is so automatic, and I need you to keep counting or give me a short external marker (like "30 seconds left") so I can actually complete the two minutes without defaulting to reassurance.

Therapist: It sounds like the tactile rhythm is helping, but the verification impulse is still present. 

Let's try to anchor that rhythm to the 2-minute task. When you notice the verification impulse, I'll say "30 seconds left" and you can focus on that countdown. When you're done, we'll take a brief pause. *counting* "1...".

Patient: "1... I'm here." The chopping rhythm is mildly stabilizing—the prickly pressure eased a notch—but the verification urge is still pulsing, trying to translate into opening my banking app. Keep counting and please call out "30 seconds left" and "10 seconds" so I actually finish the two minutes; after that, can we immediately do the 60‑second "pause—label—breathe" rule so I don't default to reassurance? I'm frustrated that my mind keeps lexicalizing the feeling into hypothesis-testing instead of just letting me be scared.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to completing the task. 

I'll keep counting and call out the markers. *counting* "1...". "30 seconds left". *counting* "1...". "20 seconds". *counting* "1...". "10 seconds". *counting* "1...". You're almost done.

When you're finished, we'll take that 60-second pause—label—breathe moment.

Patient: Okay—I finished the chopping and it helped a hair, but the verification impulse is still loud and I'm shaky and irritated that my brain keeps turning the sensation into a contingency-check. Can you lead the 60‑second "pause—label—breathe" out loud for me, with markers every 10 seconds, and then ask me to commit to not checking anything for one minute afterward so I have to actually tolerate the uncertainty?

Therapist: I'll guide you through the pause. *calmly* "Let's pause—label—breathe for 60 seconds. When I say '30 seconds left', you'll notice the sensation in your body, and when I say '20 seconds', you'll notice the thoughts. And when I say '10 seconds', you'll notice the urge to check. Let's start."

*after 30 seconds* "You're noticing the sensation, what's it like right now?"

*after 20 seconds* "What's showing up as thoughts, and what's the urge to do with them?"

*after 10 seconds* "Notice the urge to check, what's it like to let it be there without acting on it?"

Now, I want you to commit to not checking anything for just one minute. *firmly* I want you to make a choice to stay with that uncertainty, even if it feels scary. Can you do that for me?

Patient: Okay — I can do that for one minute. I'm already noticing the urge and this feels like a thin, nauseating epistemic itch, but I'll try to use the "pause—label—breathe" rule instead of checking. Please count it down out loud and call out markers; I need the external scaffolding, and if I break it I promise to report that fact rather than immediately seeking reassurance.

Therapist: I'll guide you through it. *calmly* "Let's start the minute. I'll count down: 60 seconds... 59... 58... 57... 56... 55... 54... 53... 52... 51... 50... 49... 48... 47... 46... 45... 44... 43... 42... 41... 40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35... 34... 33... 32... 31... 30... 29... 28... 27... 26... 25... 24... 23... 22... 21... 20... 19... 18... 17... 16... 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10...". When you're ready, just let me know you're done.

Patient: I'm done. It was… hard — my chest stayed prickly and that epistemic itch persisted, but it dulled a bit and I didn't check, which feels like a small victory despite the residual autonomic arousal. My brain's already pivoting to contingency-planning about how to make this tolerable next time (which is exactly the problem), so can we do another minute but with slightly less external counting—maybe a single prompt at 30s and 10s—so I can practice leaning on an internal cue? Also, I want concrete micro-rules for when I'm at work (cheffing) and the urge hits — like a rehearsed phrase or a 3-step action I can do that isn't reassurance.

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to push through the discomfort. 

For the next minute, I'll provide less external counting. *calmly* "Let's start. I'll remind you at 30 seconds and 10 seconds." 

When you notice the urge at 30 seconds, say to yourself: "I've got this." 

At 10 seconds, check in with your body: "Where's the tension?"

Patient: Okay—I started. At about 30s I said out loud, "I've got this," but my chest immediately clenched and the verification itch ramped up into catastrophizing. At ~10s I checked in with "Where's the tension?"—felt a tight, prickly band under my sternum and a knotted left shoulder, breath shallow. I'm suddenly more anxious and distracted than before; can we rehearse a specific 3-step micro-rule I can use at work so I actually have something to do instead of pinging someone for reassurance?

Therapist: It sounds like the urge to catastrophize was strong. 

Let's work on a 3-step micro-rule for when the urge hits while you're working. Here's one possibility:

When you notice the verification itch at work, take a deep breath in for a count of 4... notice the sensation in your body for a count of 6... then move your hands to the stove or a nearby surface and pick up one utensil (like a spoon or spatula) for a count of 4.

This small action can help you focus on the task at hand and give you something to do with your hands, rather than checking for reassurance. What do you think about trying this?

Patient: Conceptually that three-step scaffolding makes sense — it maps onto interrupting the verification loop and shifting to behavioral grounding — but right now I'm more anxious and distracted than before, so even the idea of counting for 6 feels impractical. Could we truncate it to something like inhale 3, scan 2, pick up a utensil for 3, or even a rehearsed cue phrase I can say in one breath (like "pause — stir — breathe") so I don't have to remember long counts in the middle of service? I'm jittery and keep getting pulled into catastrophe mode about money, so can we quickly rehearse the shortened version out loud now with you counting so I can see if I can actually do it without pinging someone for reassurance?

Therapist: I'm glad you're willing to try something small. 

Let's truncate the micro-rule to something that feels manageable in the moment. *calmly* "Inhale for 3... scan for 2... pick up a utensil for 3." 

Now, I want you to try saying "pause—stir—breathe" out loud, just once, while we're still in this moment. Can you do that?

Patient: "Pause—stir—breathe."

Saying it once made my chest clamp and my voice go thin—the verification itch spiked and I'm more anxious and distracted than a minute ago. Can we rehearse the truncated rule now with you counting (inhale 3, scan 2, pick up utensil 3) so I can try it in realtime?

Therapist: It sounds like the verbal cue didn't quite match your experience. 

Let's try again, with a focus on the physical sensations that showed up when you said "pause—stir—breathe." *calmly* "When you notice the chest clamping and your voice going thin, what's happening in your body right now?" 

Then, we'll try the truncated rule with counting: "Inhale for 3... scan for 2... pick up utensil for 3." But this time, I want you to do it while we're still in this moment, without focusing on the counting itself. Just notice what happens when you say the words "pause—stir—breathe" out loud.

Patient: When the chest clamps and my voice thins, it's basically a constellation of somatic cues—prickly constriction under the sternum, breath riding high and shallow, a knot in my left shoulder, and my heart edging up; cognitively it immediately fragments into rapid-fire, money-focused hypotheses. 

"Pause—stir—breathe." I'm saying it now and my throat tightens. I'm jittery and distracted, so please count me through the truncated rule aloud: inhale 3... scan 2... pick up utensil 3, and I'll try to follow it in real time. I need that external counting to actually do it instead of defaulting to checking.

Therapist: It sounds like the verbal cue is triggering those somatic cues again. 

Let's try it with the counting: *calmly* "Inhale for 3... *pause*... your breath is high and shallow, notice that sensation... *pause*... for 2... *pause*... and now you're noticing the knot in your left shoulder... *pause*... for 3... *pause*... you're picking up the spoon." 

As you do the counting, I want you to try to stay with the sensations in your body, not the thoughts. Can you notice what happens when you're focused on the counting, even if your mind starts to wander?

Patient: When I focus on the counting there’s a modest attenuation of that prickly constriction under my sternum and my breath feels fractionally less lodged — so the counting acts like a transient dampener. But pretty quickly the cognitive apparatus reasserts itself: probabilistic simulations about money kick in and the epistemic itch to check amplifies, especially when my attention wavers. I’m annoyed and shaky about how automatic that switch is; I need ongoing external scaffolding (you counting or a rehearsed micro-rule I can trigger reflexively at work) because my internal cueing is unreliable. Can we slow down and rehearse the truncated rule one more time with you counting (inhale 3, scan 2, pick up utensil 3) so I can try it in real time?

Therapist: It sounds like the counting is helping to dampen the constriction, but the cognitive apparatus is still pretty resilient. 

Let's rehearse the rule one more time, with a focus on making it more automatic. *calmly* "Inhale for 3... *pause*... your breath is moving... *pause*... for 2... *pause*... and now you're noticing the knot in your left shoulder... *pause*... for 3... *pause*... you're picking up the spoon." 

This time, I want you to notice what happens when you say the words "pause—stir—breathe" out loud, without focusing on the counting itself. Just notice the sensations in your body, and see if you can trigger the rule reflexively, without needing to think about it.

Patient: When I say "pause—stir—breathe" out loud my chest clamps and my voice goes thin — there's a brief interoceptive attenuation, then the epistemic itch instantly relabels it into catastrophe-mode about money. I can't seem to trigger the rule reflexively; it feels like I need the external scaffolding to make the motor step follow the phrase. I'm jittery and distracted right now, so can we rehearse it one more time with you giving a single prompt (I say the phrase immediately, then pick up the spoon) so I can try to build that quick stimulus-response pairing?

Therapist: It sounds like the phrase is still triggering those somatic cues and catastrophizing thoughts. 

Let's try one more time, with a single prompt: *calmly* "Say the phrase 'pause—stir—breathe' out loud, and immediately pick up the spoon." 

Just say the phrase, and then reach for the spoon. Don't worry about the counting or the sensations in your body. Just focus on making the motor step happen.

Patient: I said "pause—stir—breathe" out loud and tried to reach for the spoon, but my hand froze mid-reach and my chest tightened — there was an immediate surge of that epistemic itch about money. I did manage to pick up the spoon after a beat, but it felt mechanical and my mind was already drafting reassurance scripts; I'm jittery and too distracted to trust the pairing without help. Can you prompt me again — like say "now" and do three quick repeats — so I can practice the immediate stimulus-response until it feels less fragile?

Therapist: It sounds like the connection is still fragile. 

Let's try again, with a prompt to help you practice the pairing: *calmly* "Now. Say the phrase 'pause—stir—breathe' out loud. *pause* Now, reach for the spoon. *pause* Now, pick it up." 

Just repeat the sequence, focusing on making the motor step happen without thinking about the sensations or the thoughts.

Patient: I did the sequence when you said "Now"—three quick tries: each time my hand froze for a beat, my chest clenched and my voice went thin, and I only picked up the spoon mechanically while my mind immediately started drafting reassurance scripts. I'm jittery and more distracted than before, so that pairing feels fragile.

Can we do three more immediate repeats with you giving a very sharp cue (like "Now!" each time) and also tapping my wrist as a tactile prompt so it becomes a tighter stimulus-response? After that, can we do a 30‑second pause—label—breathe so I don't instantly default to checking?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to try a few more immediate repeats with a tactile prompt. 

Here we go: *calmly* "Now." *taps wrist* Say the phrase "pause—stir—breathe" out loud. *taps wrist* Reach for the spoon. *taps wrist* Pick it up. 

Let's do three more tries like that. 

When we're done, we'll try the 30-second pause—label—breathe exercise to see if we can make the connection between the phrase and the action feel more stable.

Patient: I did the three reps with the wrist taps—each time my hand hesitated and my chest tightened; the tactile prompt nudged the motor step but the epistemic itch immediately started drafting reassurance scripts. I'm more anxious and scattered now, so yes—let's do the 30‑second pause—label—breathe, but please call out "15 seconds left" and "5 seconds left" so I have external anchors; I'll report if I check afterward instead of folding into reassurance.

Therapist: It sounds like the tactile prompt helped a bit, but the epistemic itch is still strong. 

Let's do the 30-second pause—label—breathe exercise with external anchors. *calmly* "Let's start. Say the phrase 'pause—stir—breathe' out loud... 30 seconds left." 

As you do the counting, I'll remind you to notice your sensations and thoughts without judgment. When you're ready, say the phrase and pick up the spoon. 

Remember, I'll call out the remaining time counts: "15 seconds left", "10 seconds left", "5 seconds left". If you find yourself checking or getting caught up in reassurance thoughts after we're done, please report back to me.

Patient: I did the 30 seconds. I said "pause—stir—breathe," picked up the spoon, and stayed with it—somatically it was the same prickly constriction under the sternum, high shallow breath, and a knot in my left shoulder; cognitively my brain launched immediate probabilistic rumination about money, but I didn't check. I'm annoyed and jittery that the verification impulse still mounts so fast despite the exercise, and I could use a concrete post-exercise micro-rule we can rehearse now—something like "no checking for 15 minutes + do one concrete task (log one transaction or wash one pan)"—and tighter in-kitchen scaffolding (sharp wrist-tap + single-word cue) so the stimulus-response becomes more reliable. Can we roleplay that 15-minute micro-rule now and run one or two quick pairing reps with the wrist-tap and single-word cue so I can see if it feels less fragile?
