Patient: Lately I've been ruminating on how my drinking—mild to moderate, nothing dramatic—has become a functional anesthetic for the low-grade depression I've had since becoming unemployed at this stage in life. I tend to intellectualize everything—cataloguing triggers, doing cost‑benefit analyses, mapping temporal patterns—because actually naming the sadness or loneliness feels risky and unproductive. I'm pragmatic and skeptical, so I want practical help, but you should know I often talk about feelings instead of feeling them, and I suspect that's part of the problem.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that drinking helps numb the low-grade depression, what happens to the sadness or loneliness when you try to stop or take it away—what does it look like if you made room for that feeling while still drinking?

Patient: When I try to stop, there's an affective intensification — the loneliness and low mood becomes more hyperaccessible, with this weary, low-energy drag and a pretty savage inner critic that starts doing backward-looking narratives about failure. If I tried to make room for it while still drinking, the feeling would be fragmented and punctate — brief intrusions of emptiness that I immediately intellectualize or rationalize away, so the core sensation never gets processed. I know that describing it like this is a protective strategy, but I honestly don't know how to sit with the rawness without reflexively reaching for the bottle.

Therapist: So when the inner critic shows up, what matters most to you right now—the desire to stop the drinking, the fear of that critic, or the feeling of emptiness itself?

Patient: If I step back and model it, it's not a single priority so much as an avoidance network: the critic amplifies the salience of emptiness, and that amplification increases the immediate utility of drinking as negative reinforcement. So analytically the fear of the critic seems to exert the strongest behavioral pull because it makes sitting with the emptiness feel intolerable, which undermines any genuine desire to stop. But honestly, I'm saying that because it's safer to theorize—if you ask me to actually feel which one matters most, I get vague and evasive.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to analyze the fear of the critic makes sense to you, but when you're asked to feel what matters most, you feel stuck in the same pattern of safety. What happens to that "vague and evasive" feeling if you were to let it be there—just for a moment—while you looked at what matters most?

Patient: When I try to let it be, the vagueness becomes a low, wordless ache — a tightness behind the sternum and a hollow in my gut. My mind immediately launches a critique—“this proves you’re useless”—and that narration amplifies the ache; if I can tolerate the flare for maybe thirty seconds it softens into a quieter sadness instead of a spike of panic. Mostly, though, I default to intellectualizing—cataloguing causes, timelines, “solutions”—because actually sitting with the bodily stuff feels intolerable without the bottle.

Therapist: That makes sense—when you notice the ache and your mind starts criticizing it, what's the quiet sadness you notice underneath that criticism, if you could let that critique be there for just a moment?

Patient: Beneath the critique there's this resigned, muffled grief — not dramatic, more like a chronic sense of diminished possibility and small losses (routine, status, connection). It shows up as a dull pressure behind the sternum and a kind of numb hollowness in the gut, and if I let the critic be there for a moment that hum of grief becomes clearer, like background noise turning into a single note. I'm still reflexively tempted to intellectualize or reach for the bottle because actually lingering with that note feels precarious.

Therapist: So when that note shows up—like the hum of grief—it's not that you're stuck in it, but that staying with it feels like taking a risk. What if, instead of trying to stop the hum, you noticed that it's already showing up while you're trying to intellectualize or reach for the bottle?

Patient: If I actually noticed it in the moment, there's this odd paradox: awareness slightly blunts the urgency—the spike often softens into that dull hum—but my inner critic immediately weaponizes the noticing, telling me I’m failing and making the bottle look like the only expedient solution. So in theory labeling the hum (“there’s that hollow; it’s uncomfortable but not lethal”) could reduce the compulsion, but in practice I default to meta‑analysis or avoidance because the embodied feeling feels destabilizing and untrustworthy. I’m saying that now instead of feeling it, which is exactly the problem—so I'd like to try a very small, concrete step to actually notice it without drinking, if that's possible.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the hum, your inner critic shows up with that "failing" message. What if, for just one breath, you didn't try to make sense of it or fix it—just noticed that "there's that hollow" showing up while you're reaching for the bottle, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — one breath. There's that tightness behind my sternum and a hollow in my gut, and my brain immediately starts doing the narrative (“see, you're weak, this proves you failed”), but if I just name the hollow it doesn't spike as much — it just sits there, dull and present. I'm still skeptical and uncomfortable; the critic is loud and I want to reach for the bottle, so can we stay with this another breath or two?

Therapist: That's a good start. With that one breath, what happens when you look at the hollow—what's it like to notice it, even though it's not "fixed" or "useful"?

Patient: When I actually look at it, it's a dull, cool hollow under my sternum — more a flat, weary emptiness than a sharp pain. Naming it seems to shave off the panic's edge, but the inner critic immediately launches its failure narrative and the urge to drink surges. It's not "useful," but it's real, and I'm willing to stay with it another breath if we can.

Therapist: You're noticing the emptiness, not trying to change it. What happens if you were to take that willingness to stay with the emptiness and the critic's narrative, just for one more moment, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I can try one more moment. When I hold the hollow and the critic together without trying to fix them, the critic's tirade loses some of its snap and the hollow attenuates into a steady, weary pressure behind my sternum and a cold, empty feeling in my gut. I know I'm narrating this—doing meta‑analysis feels safer—but staying with it even briefly makes the urge to drink ease off a bit, so I'm willing to keep going another breath or two even though I'm wary.

Therapist: That's a small step forward. When you notice the pressure and the emptiness together, what's one tiny thing you could do with that steady, weary feeling—just for a moment, not because it has to change, but because it shows up anyway?

Patient: One tiny, pragmatic thing I can do is put my hand on my sternum and take three slow, deliberate breaths—just to acknowledge the hollow physically instead of narrating about it. I could pair that with a five‑minute rule: when the urge to drink hits, I do the breathing and wait five minutes before deciding anything; usually the urge softens. It feels a bit like stalling and my critic already calls it cowardly, but intellectually it seems tolerable, so I'm willing to try it now—can we do three breaths together?

Therapist: Noticing the physical sensation in your sternum, and taking those slow breaths—okay.

Patient: Okay — doing the three breaths now. My hand's on my sternum; the hollow's still there but the edge is duller, and the critic's already whispering that this is pointless. That small pause eased the urge a bit — can we practice a brief script or set of concrete steps I can use during the five‑minute delay so I don't just start analyzing again?

Therapist: Noticing the pause and the critic's whisper, you've already done the hard part of holding the emptiness and the urge together. What if, instead of trying to "fix" it, you simply noticed where your hand is, and what your breath feels like, for the next few minutes?

Patient: Okay — I'll try keeping my hand on my sternum and just noticing the breath for a couple minutes. It's already awkward; my brain's composing a plausible meta‑analysis about why this is pointless, but the pressure does feel a touch softer and my breaths are a bit deeper. Can you give me a simple anchor phrase or a gentle cue if I start narrating so I don't default to analysis?

Therapist: What matters most right now is that you notice your breath. When the critic starts whispering again, what if you simply say to yourself: "Notice."

Patient: Okay, I can try that—saying "Notice" feels blunt and less self‑judging than my usual meta‑analysis. I tried it once and the critic actually paused; the hollow lost a bit of its volume, but I'm already drafting a counterargument about whether this counts as real progress. Can we do another minute where I repeat "Notice" when the whisper comes and you help me stick to the five‑minute rule so I don't rationalize my way out of it?

Therapist: You're noticing the critic's pause, and that's small progress. When you feel the whisper again, what if you simply say "Notice" without trying to fix it?

Patient: Okay... I'll try saying "Notice" when the whisper comes. "Notice." It blunted the critic a hair and the hollow softened, but it's effortful and my mind's already drafting rationalizations—can we hold this for another minute so I don't slide back into analysis?

Therapist: You're holding the ground with "Notice." What if, for just one more breath, you didn't try to make sense of it—just let the phrase be there, like a small rock on the surface of the hollow?

Patient: One breath. "Notice." The word sits like a small rock on the hollow — it dulls the critic a little and the pressure becomes more of a steady, muted weight. It's effortful and my mind's already drafting theories about why this won't stick, but I can hold one more breath if you want to keep going.

Therapist: Noticing that effort, and how it shows up with the word "Notice". What if, for just one more moment, you let the weight sit there without trying to "fix" it?

Patient: Okay… I'll try to let the weight sit. I'm not sure I follow how that helps with the urge to drink—how is that supposed to help? When I stop trying to fix it the hollow just becomes a steady, dull pressure and the critic quiets a little, but this is starting to feel like a lot and I don't have much energy. Can we hold one more breath and have you cue me to say "Notice" if I start analyzing again?

Therapist: Noticing that you're wondering how letting the weight sit relates to the urge to drink—maybe it's because when you let the pressure sit, you're not trying to push it away, so the urge to drink doesn't feel like a solution. If you start analyzing again, I'll cue you to say "Notice".

Patient: Okay… I'll try that for another minute. "Notice." Saying it softens the critic a bit, but my words feel heavy and I'm a bit drained—I'm not sure I fully follow how this becomes a real barrier to the bottle long‑term. Cue me with "Notice" if I start analyzing again, and let's do one more minute with the five‑minute delay in place.

Therapist: You're noticing the heaviness of your words. If you start analyzing again, I'll say "Notice".

Patient: Okay... I'm not sure I follow how saying "Notice" keeps me from grabbing a drink long‑term — it blunts the critic but feels like a short distraction, not a solution. Still, alright — cue me with "Notice" if I start analyzing, and let's try another minute with the five‑minute delay.

Therapist: Noticing that it feels like a short distraction. When you start analyzing, I'll say "Notice".

Patient: Okay… I hear you—say "Notice" when I start analyzing. It still reads to me as a tactical distraction rather than a structural fix, and I'm not convinced it will hold against a real craving, but I'm willing to commit to the five‑minute delay and the breathing as an experiment. If the urge persists after five minutes, tell me concretely what to do next—get water, step outside, call someone—so I don't default to rationalizing.

Therapist: I'll say "Notice" when you start analyzing. If the urge persists after five minutes, you'll step outside for a 5-minute walk.

Patient: Okay... say "Notice" when I start spiraling. I'll do the five‑minute delay and then step outside for a five‑minute walk if the urge's still there. My words feel heavy and I'm skeptical this will be more than a temporary salve, but I'll experiment. If the walk doesn't help, what's the next concrete step you want me to take?

Therapist: When the urge is still there after the walk, I'd like you to notice how you feel about doing something small with that body, like making a cup of tea.

Patient: Alright — if the walk doesn't ease it, I'll try noticing how I feel about doing something small like making a cup of tea. I'm not sure I follow how that translates into resisting the compulsion — it reads as symbolic rather than substantive and my energy to parse this is pretty thin. Can you give me a very simple step‑by‑step I can follow in the moment so I don't just start rationalizing (what to say, what to do, how long to stay with it)?

Therapist: When you notice the urge and it doesn't go away after the walk, notice how your body feels when you think about doing one small thing, like stirring that tea. 

Here's what I want you to do: *just* notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea" when it comes up.

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea" when it comes up. It feels a bit like a phenomenological cue—observing the thought rather than acting—but my energy is thin and I'm skeptical this won't just be another symbolic detour. Concretely, how long should I hold that observation before deciding whether to act, and exactly what do I do if the urge's still there after I notice it (repeat "Notice," wait the five minutes, then make tea?), step‑by‑step so I don't start rationalizing?

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea", hold it for 2 seconds. That's it. Then, without thinking about it further, take one small action towards it: just *reach* for the tea cup.

Patient: Okay… I'll try that. When the thought "I should make a cup of tea" comes up I'll hold it for two seconds and then—without overthinking—reach for the cup. I'm still skeptical this isn't just symbolic and my energy's thin, so cue me with "Notice" if I start rationalizing.

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea" and you reach for the cup, I'll say "Notice".

Patient: Okay... I'll try that — hold the thought for two seconds, then reach for the cup, and you'll say "Notice." It still feels thin and a bit pointless, but I'm willing to run the experiment; cue me if I slide into analysis or if the urge spikes. If reaching for the cup doesn't help, tell me the next tiny concrete move in the moment so I don't start rationalizing.

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea" and you reach for the cup, I'll say "Notice". 

(And remember, we're not trying to fix anything or make the urge go away. We're just noticing the thought and the physical action.)

Patient: Alright — I'll try that. When the thought "I should make a cup of tea" comes, I'll hold it for two seconds and then reach for the cup without overthinking; you'll say "Notice." It feels a bit performative and I'm drained, but I'm willing to run this micro‑experiment — cue me if I start rationalizing or if the urge spikes, and tell me the next tiny step if reaching for the cup doesn't ease it.

Therapist: When you notice the thought "I should make a cup of tea" and you reach for the cup, I'll say "Notice". 

(I'll be watching for the urge to spike or for you to start rationalizing, but my main goal is to support you in noticing the thought and the physical action.)

Patient: Okay... I'll try that — hold "I should make a cup of tea" for two seconds, then reach for the cup, and you say "Notice" if I start rationalizing. It still feels a bit performative and I'm pretty drained, so tell me exactly what the next tiny move is after I reach the cup (lift it? put water in it?) so I don't default to analysis.
