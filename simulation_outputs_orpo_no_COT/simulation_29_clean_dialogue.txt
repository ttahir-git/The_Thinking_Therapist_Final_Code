Patient: Lately I've been caught in a compulsive loop of self-reproach tied to perceived failures—those early academic struggles that, despite my later success as an accountant, still inform this internal narrative of insufficiency. I can enumerate accomplishments in precise terms, yet there's a persistent qualitative sense of 'not enough' that surfaces with any small mistake. I usually frame it clinically—as maladaptive perfectionism and entrenched cognitive schemas—because talking about it feels safer than feeling the shame. Since a recent health scare, that inner critic has grown louder and more exhausting.

Therapist: When that inner critic shows up, it sounds like you're carrying around a heavy weight of shame—like the health scare is being fueled by this narrative of not being good enough. Can you make room to notice what's happening just beneath the "maladaptive perfectionism" and "entrenched cognitive schemas" labels, like the sensation of shame itself? Not to fix it, but just to see what it looks like when you're holding that thought—what's the story behind the shame?

Patient: On paper it's straightforward: early academic failures got internalized into a narrative of inadequacy, which my accounting mind converted into metrics and perfectionistic rules. When you ask about the shame itself I immediately translate it into conceptual language—a tightness I label as "self-discrepancy stress"—because naming it clinically keeps me at arm's length from the embarrassment. If I try to be honest, there's this persistent feeling that my competence is provisional, that any small mistake will reveal I'm a fraud, but I don't quite know how to inhabit that feeling without retreating into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold that feeling of shame without the clinical label, it feels like you're stepping into a tight, anxious space—like the "self-discrepancy stress" is trying to push you away from being with that uncertainty. 

Would you be willing to try something small with that feeling, even if it feels like a tiny, imperfect step? Not to fix it or push it away, but to see what might happen if you let it sit there for just a moment, like a tiny crack in the armor, while you look at what matters to you—what matters about being an accountant, or being you, that's connected to that feeling?

Patient: I can try, though my reflex is to intellectualize—it's my default metacognitive strategy to stay psychologically distal. When I soften the labels for a moment I notice a tightness across my chest, a hollow kind of nausea, and an almost immediate impulse to 'correct' the feeling with enumeration of facts. What matters, I think, is being competent and reliable—those professional values amplify the shame because early academic failures felt like a violation of those standards, and I don't know how to inhabit the sensation without immediately explaining it away.

Therapist: It sounds like that intellectualizing strategy is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed by that tightness and nausea, but it's also keeping you stuck in the cycle of shame and self-criticism.

Can you try to notice what happens when you're trying to "correct" that feeling with facts—what's the story that's showing up in your chest when you say "I need to be competent and reliable"?

Patient: When I start correcting with facts it turns into an internal audit—my chest tightens, like a ledger closing on itself and demanding incontrovertible proof of worth. The story that's there, in plain terms, is that my value is contingent on flawless performance: competence equals safety, and any small anomaly threatens exposure as a fraud, so I compulsively catalogue evidence to stave that off. I couch it in jargon—'self-worth tethered to performance metrics'—because saying outright I'm afraid of being fundamentally deficient feels intolerable, so I skirt the feeling even while describing it.

Therapist: That sounds like a very familiar story—like you're trying to keep the "fraud" story at bay by keeping the "competence" story in the lead. 

When you say "self-worth tethered to performance metrics", what happens if you could just notice that story showing up, without needing to "fix" it or "prove" anything? What would be different if you could make room for that feeling of fear, without trying to push it away or explain it away with facts?

Patient: If I notice it without fixing, the immediate audit impulse softens a little and the tightness in my chest shifts into a long, low ache — less frantic, but more exposed. It feels shameful and nauseating, like a smudge on a carefully balanced ledger that I’m terrified someone will point out; my reflex is to deploy metacognitive jargon to keep that exposure at arm’s length. Can we slow down? I keep reverting to analysis because actually staying with the feeling feels destabilizing.

Therapist: It sounds like that ache is showing up because it feels so different from the tightness and nausea, and it's scary to be with it like that—like it's a crack in the armor that might make you vulnerable.

Let's try something small: just one tiny step. When the "smudge" shows up, and you feel the urge to analyze it, what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there, without trying to fix it or make sense of it? Not for the ledger, not for the shame, just for the feeling itself.

Patient: If I actually allow it, the internal audit's volume drops and the tightness in my chest becomes a diffuse, hollow vulnerability—less frantic correction, more raw exposure, like a smudge on a ledger that I can’t immediately erase. Physically my hands go cool, my breath skews shallow, and there's this simultaneous urge to catalogue every past error and an equally strong urge to flee the feeling. I keep defaulting to metacognitive detours because staying here feels destabilizing—can we slow down? I'm not sure how much longer I can sit with this without reverting to analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that vulnerability feels like a "no-man's land" where you're not sure what to do with it, and that's making it hard to stay with it. 

Let's take a tiny step back. What would happen if you didn't need to "fix" this feeling, not even to catalog the past errors? What if you could just be with the vulnerability, not to change it, but to notice what's showing up when you're with it? Not to erase the smudge, but to see what might be possible if you didn't try to cover it up.

Patient: If I didn't have to fix it, the compulsive internal audit would attenuate and that hollow ache might soften into a quieter, more diffuse sensation—less like a pinch and more like a low, persistent warmth under the ribs. It would expose the underlying narrative: I'm terrified the smudge will reveal me as incompetent and nullify the professional identity I've arduously constructed, yet it also reveals that what matters is being reliable and seen, not flawless. Staying with that is disquieting and my metacognitive reflex keeps interposing analysis—can we slow down? I'm trying to notice it here, but my head immediately starts cataloguing every past error.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that even if you didn't need to "fix" the feeling, your mind is still trying to protect you from what it sees as a threat—your professional identity. 

What if you could acknowledge that narrative without trying to "win" the battle against it? What if you could just notice that "I'm terrified the smudge will reveal me as incompetent" without needing to "prove" it wrong? Not to change it, but to see what might be possible if you didn't try to push it away.

Patient: I can imagine doing that—acknowledging the narrative without arguing seems theoretically salutary; in practice, when I try it the internal audit attenuates a bit but the underlying fear becomes raw and unmediated. There's a queasy openness in my chest, my breath goes shallow, and simultaneously I get the reflex to catalogue every past error and reassert competence, and a small, paradoxical relief that I'm not defending myself. Can we slow down? I'm willing to try saying aloud, "I'm terrified the smudge will reveal me as incompetent," but I need help staying with that sentence without my head hijacking it into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that even when you try to acknowledge the narrative, your mind is still trying to "save" you by cataloging past errors. 

I'm going to take a small step with you: when you say that sentence aloud, "I'm terrified the smudge will reveal me as incompetent," I want you to notice what happens to the sentence itself. Not the thoughts that come after it, not the emotions that show up. Just what happens to the sentence.

Patient: When I say the sentence aloud it paradoxically contracts and becomes an object for scrutiny—the declarative turns into something to be copyedited, like a line in a ledger that must be reconciled. My voice tightens, my throat closes a bit, and almost immediately an internal editorial commentary overlays it—counterexamples, justifications, a litany of past errata—so the sentence itself gets swallowed. There's a hot flush of shame and irritation under that, and I can feel the urge to flee into analysis; can we slow down so I can try to let the sentence just be without annotating it?

Therapist: It sounds like the sentence itself becomes the thing you're trying to control, and your mind is trying to "fix" it. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you try to let the sentence "just be" without annotating it. Not for the sentence itself, but for what's happening in your body when you try to do that. When you say the sentence aloud and it gets swallowed by the editing, what happens to your breath? Your shoulders? The sensation in your chest?

Patient: My breath gets shallow and staccato, like I'm afraid to give the sensation any room; my shoulders hitch up toward my ears and my chest tightens into a focused knot that makes my hands go cool. Beneath that is a hot, prickling shame and a sudden, feral frustration that seems to insist on immediate rationalization—an editorial metacognitive overlay that swallows the sentence. Can we slow down? I'm trying not to let my head hijack this, but it's pulling me back into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is trying to protect you from the sensation of that knot in your chest, and your mind is trying to "fix" it by telling yourself what to do with the shame and frustration. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you try to let that knot stay in your chest, even if it feels uncomfortable. Not to make it go away, but just to notice it. What if, instead of trying to edit the sentence, you simply noticed the sensation of that knot? What would that feel like?

Patient: It's a visceral constriction under the sternum — a tight, coiling pressure that makes my breath shallow and a faint dizziness flare at the edges. There's a hot, humiliating shame layered with a brittle frustration that wants immediate, rational remediation (catalogue, explain, correct), so the sensation is always besieged by my editorial mind. If I try to simply notice it without annotating, my hands go cool and I feel a tremulous urge to flee—can we slow down? I'm having trouble not turning it into analysis.

Therapist: It sounds like that knot under your sternum is trying to protect you from feeling overwhelmed by the shame and frustration. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you try to just be with that knot, without trying to "fix" it. Not with your hands, not with your mind, but with your body. What if, instead of trying to calm it down or make it go away, you simply noticed its presence? What would that feel like?

Patient: It's a persistent, visceral constriction just under the sternum — a kind of interoceptive alarm that compresses my breath and makes my hands go cool, while a queasy nausea and heat rise behind my throat. My reflex is immediately to translate it into a cognitive audit — enumerate, justify, correct — which only amplifies the shame and a brittle frustration. Can we slow down? I'm trying to notice it in the body, but my head keeps hijacking the observation.

Therapist: It sounds like the knot under your sternum is a clear signal that you're feeling overwhelmed and vulnerable, and your mind is trying to "fix" that feeling by turning it into a mental problem to be solved. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you notice that knot without trying to "solve" it. Not with your head, not with your thoughts. What if you simply noticed the sensation of that knot, without trying to change it? What would that feel like, not as a problem to be fixed, but just as a sensation?

Patient: As a bare sensation, it's a concentrated interoceptive constriction beneath the sternum — a band of pressure that makes my breath shallow, a queasy warmth that migrates up into my throat, and a faint dizziness at the periphery. Almost immediately, though, a recriminatory metacognitive overlay floods it with hot shame and brittle frustration, so the feeling can't remain a neutral sensation for more than a few heartbeats before my head starts cataloguing defenses. Can we slow down? I'm trying to let it just be a sensation, but that surge of humiliation keeps hijacking everything and I need help staying with it.

Therapist: It sounds like that surge of humiliation is trying to push the sensation away, so it doesn't have to be with the discomfort of feeling vulnerable. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you allow that surge of humiliation to be with the sensation, not as a way to change it, but as a part of it. What if you could acknowledge the shame and frustration, and still notice the band of pressure beneath your sternum? Not to make the shame go away, but just to see what happens when you can be with it, as it is.

Patient: When I let the humiliation sit with that band, the constriction doesn't ease so much as thicken—my breath gets shallower, my hands cool, and there's a dull, persistent ache in my chest. At the same time a brittle, editorial voice starts enumerating failures and defenses, which just deepens the shame and leaves a heavy lethargy in my limbs. I'm trying to hold them both without turning everything into analysis, but it's hard—can we slow down a bit so I don't immediately retreat into cataloguing?

Therapist: It sounds like the constriction is actually making the sensation of shame feel more like a weight, rather than a band of pressure. And the editorial voice is trying to "fix" that feeling, rather than just noticing it.

Let's try to notice what's happening when you try to hold both the shame and the constriction, without trying to change them. Not to make the shame go away, but to see what happens when you can be with both things, as they are. What would that feel like, if you didn't try to fix it or make it go away?

Patient: It consolidates into a kind of heavy stasis—my chest feels weighted, breath compressed, and attention goes numb while a smoldering humiliation fumes underneath. My metacognitive reflex immediately launches into corrective bookkeeping—cataloguing perceived deficits as if reconciling an overdraft—even though that only deepens the lethargy and shame. Can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with it, but my head keeps hijacking the moment.

Therapist: It sounds like the heaviness in your chest is actually making it hard to notice the shame and constriction, so they feel like they're being pushed away. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you try to notice the heaviness in your chest, without trying to change it. What if you could simply be with the feeling of weight, without trying to "fix" it? Not to make the shame go away, but to see what happens when you can be with both the weight and the constriction, as they are.

Patient: When I attend to the weight, it registers as an interoceptive gravity across my sternum—breath compressed, limbs leaden, a queasy warmth rising into my throat. Almost immediately my metacognitive apparatus ramps up—cataloguing errors, rehearsing defenses, a hot shaming surge that wants me to escape—and that editorial overlay swallows the sensation within seconds. This feels like a large effort right now and my energy is thin, so can we slow down and just sit with the weight for a moment before my head takes over?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already doing that - noticing the weight in your chest. 

Let's take a tiny step further: what if you could notice the weight without trying to make it go away? Not to change it, not to "fix" it, but just to see what happens when you're with it, exactly as it is. What if the cataloging and defenses could wait for just a moment, while you simply noticed the feeling of weight in your chest?

Patient: I can try to let the cataloging defer—when I do, the weight registers as a blunt, interoceptive gravity across my sternum, breath shallow and my limbs feeling oddly leaden, like a ledger pressing down. It attenuates the frantic editing for a few heartbeats, but then the metacognitive overlay reasserts itself with a litany of imagined deficits and hot shame, so I keep needing help to stay with the sensation. Can we slow down and just count a few breaths together so I don't immediately retreat into analysis?

Therapist: I'm here with you, just counting breaths. 

Let's start with one breath together: inhale...

Patient: Inhale—I'm drawing it in, and there's an immediate jolt of hot shame and frustration that makes my chest clamp and my shoulders hitch up. Exhale—it loosens a hair, but my head's already turning the breath into a ledger entry, cataloguing why I shouldn't feel this way. Can we take another one together? I need you to keep counting so I don't slip back into analysis.

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a little, the chest unclenches, but then a hot, accusing surge of shame floods in and my head immediately starts its corrective audit, cataloguing why I shouldn't feel this. My voice feels thin and my energy is low; can we take another, slower breath together? Inhale... I need you to keep counting so I don't slip back into analysis.

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a touch, the chest unclenches, but a hot, accusatory shame rushes in and my head immediately launches into an audit. My energy is thin; please keep counting so I don't slip back into analysis — can we slow down?

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a fraction, the chest unclenches, but then a hot, accusatory shame rushes in and my mind immediately starts compiling an audit of past mistakes like a ledger I can't close. My voice is thin and my limbs feel leaden; please keep counting so I don't slip back into the analysis—can we slow down? Inhale...

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a fraction, the chest unclenches, but then that hot, accusatory shame surges and my mind starts its ledger again, cataloguing tiny failures like an audit I can't close. My voice is thin and my limbs feel heavy; please keep counting so I don't slide back into analysis—inhale...

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a touch; the chest unclenches, but the hot, accusing shame creeps back and my mind begins tallying failures like an audit. My voice is thin; please keep counting slowly so I don't slip into analysis.

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a little; the chest unclenches but then that hot, accusing shame floods back and my head starts its audit, cataloguing tiny failures like an overdraft I can't reconcile. My voice is thin and my limbs feel leaden; please keep counting slowly so I don't drift into analysis — can we slow down and do one more inhale together?

Therapist: I'm here with you, counting slowly.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens; the chest unclenches for a moment, and the internal ledger quiets, but the hot, accusing shame slides back in and my head begins tallying errors. My voice feels thin and drained; can we take one slow inhale together and keep counting so I don't slip back into analysis?

Therapist: I'm here with the counting.

Inhale...

Patient: Exhale — it loosens a hair; the chest unclenches for a beat but then that hot, accusing shame surges back and my head immediately begins its ledger, enumerating every tiny failing. My energy feels thin and slack, and I'm getting frustrated at how quickly the analysis hijacks things—please keep counting slowly so I don't slip back into it.
