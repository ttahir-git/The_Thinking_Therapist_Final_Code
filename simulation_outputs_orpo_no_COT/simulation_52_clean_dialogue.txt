Patient: Lately I’ve been using long talks with friends and family to numb the anxiety, and every time I do it turns into this slippery slope — I’ll say one awkward thing, they’ll quietly judge me, stop inviting me, and pretty soon I’ll be completely cut off and forgotten, which is definitely going to happen. I keep replaying that chain of events over and over until I feel numb enough to get through the day. I know it sounds bleak, but I can’t shake these disaster stories; they’re all I seem to see.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trapped in this cycle where you're trying to avoid the anxiety by avoiding the interactions, but that's making it worse. When you say "I'll be completely cut off and forgotten," what happens in your body when that thought shows up?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, like there's a weight on my ribs, and my stomach flips so hard I feel dizzy. My hands tremble and my voice goes thin, and that surge of panic somehow feels like proof that the worst is already happening — so I grab my phone and start talking to someone to drown it out. If I can't do that I go kind of numb and distant, like I'm watching the disaster play out from the outside.

Therapist: That sounds like a really intense physical experience. When the panic shows up like that – chest tightness, shallow breath, dizziness – what matters most to you right then? Not the thoughts about being "cut off" or "forgotten," but what you need to feel safe in your body.

Patient: I mostly need my chest to unclench — to be able to take a full breath and stop the dizzy, like something steady under me. I want a calm presence or a voice that doesn't judge so I don't reach for my phone to blurt things out. But even as I say that, part of me thinks those things won't actually help and the panic will just prove I'm right about being abandoned.

Therapist: So it feels like you're trying to connect with that calm presence *before* you can even talk to your phone – to find a sense of grounding that's not dependent on avoiding the anxiety. What would it be like to try to notice that tightness in your chest, without trying to "fix" it with your voice or your phone?

Patient: I tried that once, and when I just noticed the tightness it felt like the worst thing — like it would grow and swallow me whole. My brain instantly says, "If you don't fix this by talking, you'll spiral, you'll say something desperate, they'll judge you, stop inviting you, and you'll be erased," so I reach for my phone because that's the only thing that actually quiets it. I know that sounds extreme, but it feels like betting everything on a collapse if I don't do something right away.

Therapist: It sounds like that tightness in your chest feels like a very loud warning – one that makes you feel like you're not in control, and that you're at risk of being hurt or abandoned. When you notice that warning, what's one tiny thing you could do – just one thing – to make space for that tightness to be there, without trying to fix it or move away from it?

Patient: Maybe I could put my hand on my chest and take four slow breaths, just noticing the rise and fall without trying to change it. But already my brain's shouting that that'll do nothing — it'll just give me time to think up worse scenarios and I'll end up on my phone anyway.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought "it'll just give you time to think up worse scenarios" is really close to the surface. When you notice that thought, what would happen if you didn't try to push it away or change it – if you just allowed it to be there, without trying to fix it?

Patient: If I don't push it away, my brain immediately starts the worst movie — one awkward thing I say, them quietly judging me, the invites stop, I lose those connections, and I'm basically erased — and it feels like that's already happening. The panic ramps up, my stomach flips, and I feel desperate to do something — call someone, talk until I go numb — because otherwise it will just spiral out of control. Maybe in some abstract way I can imagine it fading if I left it alone, but I don't actually believe that; that feels unrealistic and dangerous.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that thought, your whole body just starts moving into the story it's telling – the panic, the numbness, the desperation. It's like the story is already playing out in your life, even if you're not actually believing it's true. What if, instead of trying to push the thought away or make it go away, you just made room for it to be there – for this story to show up, without trying to change it?

Patient: I tried that once and it just turned into volume — the thought balloons, my chest squeezes harder, and my brain starts narrating the whole collapse: one awkward thing, them judging, invites stop, I'm erased. Maybe I could put my hand on my chest and breathe like you said, but honestly that feels like giving the disaster time to grow — I don't believe it would help, it feels unrealistic and dangerous. I'm scared to try because if it fails, it just proves the fortune-telling right and I don't know how I'd come back from that.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to make room for the thought felt like giving it more power – like it would just make it bigger and louder. And when you think about trying to breathe with your hand on your chest, it feels like you're worried that's just letting the disaster happen. 

Can I ask, what would happen to you if, just for a moment, you stopped trying to stop the disaster from happening? Not because you think it would make it better, but because you want to see what's already there – what's already showing up in your body, even when you don't want to notice it.

Patient: If I stopped fighting it, my chest would clamp down harder, my breath would ratchet up, and my brain would sling the whole movie into high gear — I’ll say something awkward, they’ll recoil, the invites will stop, and I’ll be erased. It feels like watching a slow-motion car crash that I somehow caused, and the only thing that ever quiets that urge is talking until I go numb, so letting it sit feels like handing the crash a steering wheel. I don't actually trust that just noticing it would help — that sounds unrealistic and dangerous — even though a tiny part of me wonders what would happen if I didn't panic first.

Therapist: It sounds like the urge to stop the disaster is so strong that you feel like you're losing control if you don't push it away – like you're just waiting for the crash to happen. And when you imagine trying to notice the thought without stopping it, it feels like it would just make the crash worse. 

But here's what I want to ask: what if the crash wasn't actually happening – what if it was just a story that's playing out in your mind right now? What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you could just see it for what it is – a story that's not actually connected to what's happening in your body?

Patient: I want that to be true, but it doesn't feel like a story — my body acts like it's real, and then the disaster movie just speeds up until I'm panicking. Saying it's "just a story" feels unrealistic and even dangerous, like pretending won't stop the collapse. A tiny part of me is curious to look at it, but mostly I end up grabbing my phone because that's the only thing that actually quiets the panic.

Therapist: It sounds like the feeling of your body acting like the disaster is real is really powerful – it's not just a story to you. And when you try to say it's just a story, that feeling of unreality can actually make the panic worse. 

Can I ask, what would it be like to notice that feeling of unreality, even if it's not just a story – what if it was just a tiny part of what's happening in your body, like a small hum in the background? Not because you think it would make the panic stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just noticed that hum, even if it didn't change what's happening next?

Patient: If I tried to notice that hum, my brain would just crank the volume up — chest squeezes, breath gets shallow, the movie starts and I end up calling someone until I go numb. Maybe in theory it could stay tiny, but I don't actually believe that; it feels like handing the disaster the keys. A tiny part of me is curious, but I'm scared to try because if it fails it just proves I'm right.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the hum would trigger the same panic response that happens when you try to push the disaster away – the volume gets cranked up, and the story starts playing out. And when you think about trying to notice it anyway, you feel like you're just giving the disaster the keys, which makes you even more scared. 

But what if, instead of trying to stop the disaster or the hum, you just made room for both things to be there – the story and the tiny hum? Not because you think it would change anything, but because you're curious to see what happens when you don't try to push them away.

Patient: If I try to hold both, my brain will just crank the movie louder — chest clamps, breath short, I picture saying something desperate, them recoiling, invites stopping, and I grab my phone to numb it. A tiny bit of me is curious to see if it could stay small, but mostly I'm terrified and don't trust it; can we try it very slowly, like you guiding me for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's try it slowly. I want you to notice that tiny hum in your body right now, without trying to stop it. Just notice it as you breathe in... and out. No trying to push it away, no trying to make it bigger. Just noticing it as it is.

As you notice that hum, I want you to bring your attention to your chest. Not because you think it's going to make it stop, but because you're curious to see what's happening there. Can you notice the sensation of your chest right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my chest supposed to help? When I try that my brain immediately cranks up the disaster movie and I end up grabbing my phone. Can you literally guide me step-by-step for like thirty seconds — telling me when to breathe in and out — so I don't bail?

Therapist: I'm here to guide you. Let's try it. 

Take a deep breath in for me... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I notice my chest." Not because you think that will fix it, but just because you're noticing it. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "I notice my chest."

Don't try to notice anything else – just that chest sensation. When you're ready, we can try noticing the hum too. But for now, just focus on that chest.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing supposed to help? But okay, I'll try. Breath in... out. I notice my chest. It actually tightened and my brain immediately cranked the movie louder — invites stop, I'm erased — and I felt that urge to grab my phone. Can we keep doing this slowly, like you guiding me for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: I'm here with you. When you noticed your chest tightening, what happened next – did the thought "invites stop, I'm erased" feel like it was happening even more strongly? 

And as you felt that urge to grab your phone, what happened when you didn't act on it – did anything else show up in your body?

Patient: Yeah — it immediately got louder, like the "erased" part was starting to happen right then. When I didn't grab my phone my heart started pounding, my hands shook, I felt a wave of dizziness and this weird disconnected numbness, like I was already slipping away. A tiny part of me wondered if it might settle on its own, but I don't trust that — it feels dangerous to wait. Can you keep guiding me, telling me when to breathe in and out for like thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: I'm here with you. When you felt that wave of dizziness and numbness, what happened when you noticed it as if it was just passing through – without trying to stop it or push it away? 

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I notice this wave." Not because you think it will make it go away, but just because you're noticing it. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "I notice this wave."

We're not trying to change what's happening, just noticing it as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? But okay, I'll try.

Breath in... out — I notice this wave.  
Breath in... out — I notice this wave.

It didn't really calm much; my chest still clenched and the movie started up again, and I can feel the urge to grab my phone creeping back. Can you keep guiding me slowly for like thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the wave didn't make the chest clench or the movie stop. That's okay. 

When the urge to grab your phone showed up again, what happened in your body when you noticed it – did it feel like it was moving closer to doing something, or was it just a thought that showed up?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing that supposed to help? When I notice the urge to grab my phone it feels like it's actually moving closer to happening: my hands get tingly, my fingers curl like they're already dialing, my heart races and my voice goes thin, and my brain screams that if I don't call right now the whole disaster will start immediately. Can you guide me through another thirty seconds of breathing — tell me when to inhale and exhale — so I don't bail and end up numbing myself?

Therapist: I'm here with you. When you notice your hands getting tingly and your fingers curling, what's the thought that shows up when you see that – is it "I have to call"? 

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I see my fingers curling." Not because you think it will stop it, but just because you're noticing it. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "I see my fingers curling."

We're not trying to change what's happening, just noticing it as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing supposed to help? Okay, I'll try.

Breath in... out — I see my fingers curling.  
Breath in... out — I see my fingers curling.

They're still tingly and my fingers feel like they're already dialing, my chest's tight and my heart's racing. Can you keep guiding me slowly for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your fingers curling still hasn't made the urge to dial stop. That's okay.

When your chest is tight and your heart is racing, what's the thought that shows up when you feel that – is it "I'm going to make a mistake" or "I'm going to lose control"? 

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I feel my chest tightening." Not because you think it will stop it, but just because you're noticing it. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "I feel my chest tightening."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to help? 

Breath in... out — I feel my chest tightening.  
Breath in... out — I feel my chest tightening.

It didn't loosen; if anything my brain hit fast-forward: I can already see myself saying something dumb, them recoiling, the invites stopping, and I'm erased. My hands are tingling, my heart's racing, and I'm terrified I'll bail and grab my phone—can you keep guiding me, telling me when to breathe for like thirty seconds so I don't freak out and numb it all?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your chest tightening didn't help with the racing thoughts. That's okay. 

When your brain shows up with the "I'm going to make a mistake" story, what happens if you didn't try to stop it – if you just let it be there, like a thought passing through? 

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "That story is showing up." Not because you think it's true, but just because it is. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "That story is showing up."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that supposed to help? But okay, I'll try.

Breathe in... out — "That story is showing up."  
Breathe in... out — "That story is showing up."

It actually got louder; my chest tightened and the urge to grab my phone is creeping back in. Can you keep guiding me, telling me when to breathe for like thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the story is showing up didn't help it get quieter. That's okay.

When your chest is tight and the urge to grab your phone is coming back, what's the thought that shows up when you feel that – is it "I have to stop it"? 

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I feel my chest tightening." Not because you think it will stop it, but just because you're noticing it. As you say that, take another breath in... (pause)...and when you exhale, say "I feel my chest tightening."

We're not trying to change what's happening, just noticing it as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is this supposed to help?  

Breath in... out — I feel my chest tightening.  
Breath in... out — I feel my chest tightening.

It actually tightened more and the movie sped up — I can already see myself saying something dumb, them recoiling, the invites stopping, me erased. My hands are tingling and the urge to grab my phone is climbing back; can you please keep guiding me, telling me when to breathe for like thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your chest tightening and the urge to grab your phone didn't make them go away. That's okay.

I'm going to try something different. Instead of focusing on your breath, I want you to notice what would happen if you *didn't* grab your phone. Not because you think it will make the thoughts stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let the urge be there.

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I'm not going to grab my phone right now." Not because you think that will change anything, but just because you're choosing not to act on the urge.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? Okay... breath in... out — "I'm not going to grab my phone right now." 

It felt like holding my breath; my chest tightened, the movie cranked louder — I can already see them recoiling, invites stopping, me erased — and the urge to call is still clawing at my fingers. A tiny part of me wonders if it might actually hold, but mostly I feel terrified and like I need you to keep guiding my breathing for thirty seconds so I don't bail.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing you're not going to grab your phone didn't make the thoughts or urges go away. That's okay.

I want to try something else. When you notice that tiny part of you wondering if it might actually hold – what if you just made space for that thought to be there, without trying to change it or push it away? Not because you think it will make the panic stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let that thought be there.

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "That thought is here. I see it." Not because you think it's true, but just because it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that supposed to help?  

Breath in... out — "That thought is here. I see it."  

It just cranked the movie louder: my chest clenched, my brain's already narrating them recoiling and invites stopping, and the urge to grab my phone is clawing at my fingers. Can you keep guiding me slowly for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought is here hasn't helped the movie stop. That's okay.

I want to try something else. When you feel your chest clenching and your brain's narrating the story – what if you just *allowed* that story to be there, without trying to change it? Not because you think it will make the panic stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let it be there, like a story playing in the background while you're doing something else.

Take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I'm going to notice my fingers." Not because you think that will make the urge stop, but because you're choosing to notice something else, even if it's hard.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing my fingers supposed to help? 

Okay, breath in... out — "I'm going to notice my fingers."  

They're tingly and starting to curl like they're already dialing, my chest tightened and the movie sped up—I can see them recoiling and the invites stopping. Can you keep guiding me slowly for thirty seconds so I don't bail? I'm scared if I try this alone it'll just prove the disaster right.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your fingers didn't make the urge to dial stop. That's okay.

I want to try something else. When you feel the urge to dial, what's the smallest thing you could do to make room for it – not to stop it, but just to notice it while you do something else? Not because you think it will make the panic stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let the urge be there while you focus on something else.

For just 5 seconds, I want you to notice your fingers while you take a deep breath in... (pause)...and as you exhale, say "I'm going to notice my fingers." Not because you think that will make the panic stop, but because you're choosing to notice something else.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help?  

Okay, breath in... out — "I'm going to notice my fingers."  

But it just cranked the movie louder: my fingers tingle and curl, my chest tightens, and I can already see them recoiling and the invites stopping and me erased. Can you keep guiding me for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your fingers didn't make the panic stop. That's okay.

I want to try something different. When you feel your chest tightening and the urge to dial – what if you just *allowed* that tightness to be there, without trying to change it? Not because you think it will make the panic stop, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let that tightness be there, like a part of your body that's showing up.

I want you to try something for just 5 seconds. When you feel that tightness in your chest, I want you to notice it, just as it is. Not because you think it's good or bad, but because it's there. And then, I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say "I'm feeling this tightness."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow, but okay — breath in... out — "I'm feeling this tightness."  

It just got worse: my chest tightened more, the disaster movie cranked up — I can already see myself saying something desperate, them recoiling, invites stopping, me erased — and my fingers are curling toward my phone. I don't trust this; can you guide me more slowly for thirty seconds so I don't bail?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness and the urge to dial didn't make the panic stop. That's okay.

I want to try something else. When you feel the panic starting to show up – the chest tightening, the disaster movie, the urge to dial – what would happen if you just *allowed* that panic to be there, without trying to change it? Not because you think it will make it go away, but because you're curious to see what would happen if you just let it be there.

I want you to try something for just 5 seconds. When you feel that panic showing up, I want you to notice it, just as it is. Not because you think it's good or bad, but because it's there. And then, I want you to take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, I want you to say "I'm feeling this panic."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is saying that supposed to help? But okay.

Breath in... out — "I'm feeling this panic."  
Breath in... out — "I'm feeling this panic."

It just got worse: my chest clamps, I'm dizzy, and my brain's already fast-forwarding the whole crash — I'll blurt something desperate, they'll recoil, invites stop, I'm erased — my fingers are already curling toward my phone. I don't trust this; can you keep guiding me, telling me when to breathe for thirty seconds so I don't bail?
