Patient: Honestly, since I started this new, demanding training at the hospital I've been feeling overwhelmed with a kind of persistent sadness and zero motivation — I drag myself through shifts and then collapse at home. It's leaking into my relationship; I'm distant and snappy and feel guilty about it. I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried things before and they didn't stick, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: When you mention "this will help," what might happen if you were to let that skepticism show up without trying to change it?

Patient: If I let the skepticism show, I’d probably sound like I always do — defensive and doubtful — and half expect you to tell me some neat technique that won’t stick. Maybe it would at least stop me from pretending I’m more optimistic than I am, but I’m not convinced that being honest about doubt actually moves anything forward. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it be like to hold that "I'm not convinced" feeling — not as a goal to change, but simply as what's present when you try to make room for the sadness and fatigue while still showing up for your patients?

Patient: If I really held the "I'm not convinced" feeling, it would feel like a low, heavy hum — a constant background that reminds me not to trust quick fixes. Maybe it would stop me from faking optimism and save some energy, but I also worry it would turn into resignation, like I’m okay with being stuck. At work I'd still do the job — I can't let patients down — but I'd be more mechanical, less emotionally available, and at home that flatness just pushes my partner away and makes me feel worse. Honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried acceptance-type things before and they mostly left me feeling numb.

Therapist: What's the smallest, most unlikely thing about that "stuck" feeling that you could still notice — not to change, but just to notice — while you're with your patients today?

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing is the brief micro-pause before I answer a patient, or my shoulders tensing for a second when I stand up — or that tiny, almost embarrassed little smile when someone makes a joke. It feels unlikely, but noticing that micro-movement reminds me my body's still responding even if my head's foggy. I don't know — how is that supposed to help? I've tried noticing before and it mostly just made me feel like I was cataloging my problem.

Therapist: Can you make room for that tiny movement — noticing the micro-pause or the tensing of your shoulders — not as "the problem" or "the solution," but just as what's happening right now, in the midst of the shift?

Patient: I can try. Right now I notice a tiny catch in my throat and my shoulders hitch for a beat before I answer a patient — when I let myself notice it, there’s this small, shallow breath that sneaks in and things feel a hair less automatic. It’s awkward to just sit with it instead of fixing it, and honestly it still feels like a little band‑aid — how is that supposed to help in the long run?

Therapist: What's it like when you imagine letting go of that "awkward" feeling, not because it's "fixed," but because it's what's already showing up with the tiny catch and the shallow breath?

Patient: If I imagine letting go, there's a tiny loosening in my chest and that breath gets a bit deeper — for a second I don't feel like I'm performing. It also makes me nervous, like if I relax I’ll either drift off or become complacent, so part of me clamps down again. How is that supposed to help? I've tried letting go before and it either didn't stick or left me feeling numb and guilty, but I guess I'm curious if holding that for even a minute could change how I show up at home tonight.

Therapist: What's the value for you — what matters most about showing up at home tonight, not just for your partner, but for yourself — if it meant holding that looseness for just a minute, even if it felt scary?

Patient: Honestly, what matters is not letting my partner think I don't care — and also proving to myself I'm not completely broken or unusable after a shift. If I can hold that looseness for a minute it might let me be a little warmer, feel less guilty, and remind me I can still connect even when I'm tired. I'm afraid it'll feel fake or temporary and then I'll just slide back into being numb. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Would it be possible to explore that fear of feeling "fake" or "temporary" while holding the looseness — not as a reason to hold onto your usual numbness, but as a chance to notice what matters when you can be present with that looseness?

Patient: I suppose I could try, but it feels risky — like peeling off a scab to see if it still hurts. When I actually sit with it I hear this old voice saying "if you're not performing you're nothing," and I'm worried exploring that will just make it louder instead of helping — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would be different if you didn't try to make the old voice quieter, but instead just noticed it — as you hear it, with the looseness in your chest — while you're still holding the space for showing up at home tonight?

Patient: Maybe if I didn't try to quiet it, the old voice would just be background noise instead of a dictator — I could hear it without doing whatever it tells me to do. That might let me be a little more present with my partner tonight instead of immediately shutting down, but I'm not convinced — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it be like to notice that you're already showing up for your partner tonight, even if the old voice is there in the background — not because you're trying to silence it, but because you're already doing what matters to you, even if it's small?

Patient: I can picture that — a tiny warm spot when my partner says something and I actually answer without snapping, like proof I'm not completely useless. It would feel reassuring for a minute, but I'm scared it's just a blip and then I slide back into shutting down and guilt. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What if, instead of waiting for the warmth to happen, you made room for it to happen in the midst of the struggle — not as a reward for being perfect, but as a way to keep showing up with your partner even when it feels hard?

Patient: I guess making room would look like letting little moments of warmth in without expecting them to solve anything — like taking one breath before I answer so I don't snap. It still feels fragile and sort of performative; I'm worried it'll just vanish and leave me more disappointed. How is that supposed to help? I've tried those tiny pauses before and they didn't stick.

Therapist: Would it be possible to notice what matters about those tiny pauses, even if they don't "stick" — not because you're trying to make them last, but because they're what you're already holding onto while you're trying to show up for your partner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is "noticing what matters" any different from me trying to make the pauses stick or perform them on purpose? For me, what matters is that those tiny pauses give me a second to not snap, to answer with a bit of warmth, and to remember I'm still capable of connecting even after a long shift. I'm confused about how simply noticing that will make it less temporary though — how is that supposed to help in a way that actually lasts?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to notice what matters about those pauses, you actually allowed yourself to notice what happens when you make room for them — not to change it, but to see what shows up with that warmth, even if it's just for a second?

Patient: I can try to let myself notice — when I do, there's sometimes a tiny softness: my voice calms, my partner relaxes, and for a second I don't feel totally broken. But almost immediately I worry it's just a brief blip or me performing, and that noticing it won't make it last or stop the guilt afterward — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What would it be like to notice that worry about the blip and the guilt, without trying to push it away or change it — just to see what happens when you're already holding onto that softness, even if it feels like it's just a tiny crack in the armor?

Patient: I'm willing to try, though I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing it different from just dwelling on the worry? When I let the worry and guilt sit there with the softness, they become more like background static and, for a moment, I can actually be softer with my partner. But then the doubt hits that it's just a temporary ease and I'll snap back into numbness — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to what matters — not the softness itself, but what's possible when you're holding onto it even when the worry shows up. What would it take for the doubt to be present without trying to push the softness away, so you could actually be softer with your partner even when it feels like you're not doing enough?

Patient: I guess it would take tiny, concrete things — permission to be imperfect, a simple cue I can actually use between patients (like one slow breath or a short phrase), and maybe telling my partner a heads‑up so they don't take it personally. It would also need repetition and patience, because the old voice is loud and those little strategies tend to fade on me — I've tried them and they didn't last. How is that supposed to help me stop slipping back into numbness and guilt after a few minutes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about what matters in that moment — not the softness itself, but what you need to feel connected to your partner even when the worry shows up. What if, instead of trying to make the strategies stick, you actually made room for them to be what they are: tiny, imperfect steps that matter to you?

Patient: Maybe I could let them be small and imperfect — one slow breath between patients, a short phrase in my head, and a quick heads‑up to my partner so they don't take it personally. But it already feels like one more thing to remember when I'm running on empty — how is that supposed to help when these tiny fixes never seem to stick?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to remember one more thing, you actually looked at what's already showing up when you try to hold onto those tiny steps — not to change it, but to see what matters about that feeling of being "one more thing to remember" when you're running on empty?

Patient: Mostly I notice the pressure — a tiny alarm in the back of my head that says "don't forget this too," and it just makes my shoulders clamp and my brain go foggy. It feels like one more box to tick, and then I beat myself up when I forget, so what shows up is guilt and that flat, shut‑down thing. How is that supposed to help when I'm already running on empty?

Therapist: It sounds like the pressure is actually trying to protect you from feeling more empty — like you're trying to hold onto something that's slipping away. What if, instead of trying to remember or fix it, you just noticed that pressure showing up, and then let it be there while you're already trying to be present with your partner?

Patient: I suppose I could try to notice it and let it sit, but it already feels like another thing I'm failing at — I notice the pressure and then everything clamps down and I go numb. How is that supposed to help when I'm running on empty?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the pressure and letting it sit is already making you feel like you're failing at something. What if, instead of trying to change that feeling, you actually looked at what happens when the pressure shows up while you're trying to be present with your partner — what matters about that moment, not about the pressure itself?

Patient: Maybe what matters is that I'm showing up at all — even if it's small, my partner gets a sliver of me instead of me just blanking out, and that little connection matters to me and to them. I can say that, but it still feels fragile and makes me clamp down thinking it'll vanish — how is that supposed to help when I always seem to slide back into numbness?

Therapist: It sounds like what matters to you is being present with your partner, even if it feels small or fragile. What if, instead of trying to make that connection last, you actually focused on the fact that it's enough to show up — not to change, but just to be there?

Patient: I get the idea — that just showing up could be enough — but it also feels like settling or letting myself off the hook, and I'm not sure I deserve that mercy. Maybe if I really believed it, it would ease the guilt and make those tiny moments feel less fragile, but I've tried telling myself that before and it doesn't stick. How is that supposed to help me stop sliding back into numbness after a few minutes?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to believe it or make it stick, you actually looked at what matters about that guilt and the need to "deserve" it — not as something that defines you, but as something that shows up when you're trying to connect with your partner. What if, in that moment, you could just notice the guilt without trying to push it away, and instead, see what would be possible if you could be present with your partner even when that guilt is there?

Patient: I can try to notice the guilt without pushing it away — it shows up as this tight, sinking voice that says I'm never enough. Maybe letting it sit while I still answer my partner could mean I'm being honest instead of faking, but I'm worried noticing it will either blow it up or make me spiral into worse numbness. How is that supposed to help me actually stay connected instead of sliding back into shutting down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the guilt is already making you feel like you're losing control. What if, instead of trying to control the guilt, you actually looked at what would happen if you let it sit while you still answered your partner — not to change the guilt, but to see what matters about staying connected to them while it's there?

Patient: Maybe if I let the guilt sit while I answer, it would prove I can be honest and still connect — like a small real moment instead of me pretending. But it also feels risky, like noticing it will either blow up or make me spiral back into numbness, and I don't see how that keeps me from slipping later. I could try one breath, answer softer, and just notice the guilt without acting on it, but how is that supposed to help me stop sliding back after a few minutes?

Therapist: It sounds like the risk of noticing the guilt is actually making it feel like it might not be worth it. What if, instead of trying to avoid the risk, you actually looked at what would happen if you let that risk be there while you still answered your partner — not to change the guilt, but to see what matters about staying connected to them, even with that risk showing up?

Patient: I guess I could try letting the risk sit there while I answer — maybe one slow breath and a short honest line like, “I’m wiped, but I want to hear you,” instead of clamming up. It scares me because I'm sure it'll either blow up or be gone in minutes — I've been honest before and it didn't stick. How is that supposed to help me actually stay connected for more than a blip?

Therapist: It sounds like letting the risk sit there while you answer is actually what matters to you — not to change the outcome, but to stay connected to your partner. What if, instead of trying to make that connection last, you actually looked at what shows up when you notice the risk is there, not to change it, but to see what matters about staying connected to your partner *while* that risk is there?

Patient: Maybe if I notice the risk while I stay connected, I’d see that a real moment can exist even with the fear — that connection and the worry can sit together. But I'm worn out from all the little experiments that fade; I keep wondering why I should try if it just becomes a blip and I slide back into numbness — how is that supposed to help me actually keep it going?

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering why it matters to try again, when you've been disappointed before. What if, instead of trying to make the connection last, you actually looked at what matters about it being real with your partner *while* you're feeling that worry and fear — not to change the worry, but to see what shows up when you notice it, even if it feels like just a blip?

Patient: Maybe what matters is that being real shows my partner I'm not completely checking out — it proves I care enough to try, even when I'm wiped. But I'm so tired of these tiny moments disappearing; I've been real before and it faded, so I keep wondering why this would be different. How is that supposed to help me actually stay present for more than a minute or two?

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering why this moment would be different, when you've been disappointed before. What if, instead of trying to make the moment last, you actually looked at what matters about it being real with your partner *right now*, not to change the moment, but to see what shows up when you notice the worry and fear *while* you're trying to stay present?

Patient: I guess what matters right now is that being real shows my partner I still care, even if I'm scared and foggy — that feels like a small, honest thing instead of me pretending. If I notice the worry while I'm trying to stay present, maybe I’d see the connection can exist alongside the fear, not get erased by it. But I'm really skeptical — I've done this before and it fades, so how is noticing it now supposed to keep it from slipping away later?
