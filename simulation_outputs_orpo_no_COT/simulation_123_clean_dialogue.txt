Patient: Lately I've been getting really anxious in social situations, to the point where I'm avoiding gatherings with friends even though my partner's really supportive. I also have OCD and ongoing financial stress, and it's starting to mess with my focus at work as a data scientist. I'm not great at talking about this stuff, and honestly I don't know—it's just overwhelming.

Therapist: When you say "I'm avoiding gatherings with friends even though my partner's really supportive," what would happen if you *made room* for that avoidance right now, even if it meant sitting with the discomfort for just a tiny bit?

Patient: I don't know—I guess if I tried to make room for it my chest would tighten and I'd want to leave or hide behind my phone. It feels embarrassing, like admitting I'm failing at being social, so I just avoid that feeling. I don't really want to dwell on it, but maybe starting with just a minute could be doable?

Therapist: That's really small: 1 minute. Not about changing what happens in your chest, but about noticing it while you're sitting with that thought "I'm failing at being social." Can you imagine sitting with the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering" right now, without trying to change it or push it away, for just 1 minute?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try to hold the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering" for a minute, but my chest already feels tight and I want to reach for my phone or make an excuse. Maybe I can do it, but I'm worried I'll freak out or just zone out — can you help me stay with it?

Therapist: I'm here to help you stay with it. When you notice your chest tightening, what happens if you simply *acknowledge* that sensation – not to change it, but just to notice it – right there with the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering"? No judgment, no trying to fix it.

Patient: I don't know — my chest's already tight and my breathing gets shallow, and my hands want to fidget. I can notice the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering" and the other one, "I'm failing," but it's really hard to just sit with that without trying to fix it. Can you help me stay with it? I'm worried I'll bolt or grab my phone.

Therapist: Those sensations – the tight chest, shallow breathing, fidgeting hands – they're showing up when you're trying to hold the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering." When that happens, what if you *allowed* those sensations to be there – not to change them, but just to notice them – while you kept the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try to let them be, but my chest's really clenching and my hands won't stop fidgeting and then my brain starts trash-talking me. Can you guide me through it? Maybe tell me what to focus on so I don't want to bolt.

Therapist: I'm going to guide you gently through it. When the tight chest shows up, I want you to notice it just for a second – not to change it, but to see it – while you focus on your breath. When your hands start fidgeting, what if you simply *allowed* that movement to happen, without trying to stop it? 

Now, bring your attention back to the thought "I'm avoiding this gathering". Just notice it, without trying to change it. What happens when you keep that thought present, even with the tightness and fidgeting – *just for 5 more seconds*?

Patient: I don't know—I tried to keep the thought for five seconds and my chest felt really tight, my breathing got shallow, and my hands just kept fidgeting while this voice kept saying I'm failing. I guess after a few seconds it didn't feel like I'd actually collapse, maybe it loosened a tiny bit, but I'm still shaky and feel like grabbing my phone. Can you keep guiding me? I'm not great at staying with this.

Therapist: It sounds like you noticed that even after a few seconds, the sensations still felt overwhelming. That's okay. When your chest felt tight, your breathing shallow, and your hands fidgeting, what if you simply *allowed* those sensations to be there, without trying to fix them – just for another second? Not to change them, but just to notice them.

And then, when that voice said "I'm failing", what if you looked at it like a thought – not like the truth about you? Just a thought. What happens if you kept that thought present, even when the other sensations still felt hard to handle?

Patient: I don't know — I guess when I try to see "I'm failing" as just a thought it loses a little of its power, like maybe a notch, but my chest is still tight and that voice just circles back. I keep wanting to reach for my phone or make an excuse to leave. Can you help me stay with it for, like, ten seconds and give me something to focus on so I don't bolt?

Therapist: When you notice the chest tightness and the voice circling back, what if you *focused* on the sensation of your feet touching the ground – just the feeling of your feet on the floor, where you are sitting? Not trying to change it, not trying to fix it, just noticing that feeling. And what if you kept that feeling of your feet on the ground for just 10 more seconds, while the thoughts and sensations still showed up?

Patient: I don't know—I tried to focus on my feet for the ten seconds and I could kind of feel them, like a slight grounding, but my chest stayed tight and that voice kept circling "I'm failing." I guess it helped a tiny bit, but I'm still shaky and my hands keep wanting my phone. Can we try something else—maybe a 5-4-3-2-1 grounding or a guided breathing pattern? I'm worried I'll bolt if we just sit in it.

Therapist: When the chest tightness and the voice kept showing up, even with the slight grounding, what if we tried something else together? A 5-4-3-2-1 grounding can be a helpful way to notice what's happening in your body and mind, even when it feels hard.

Here's what I'd like you to try: notice 5 things you can see around you, even if they're small – like the edge of the chair, the top of the lamp, or the picture on the wall. Take just a moment to notice those things, without trying to change them or fix them.

Then, notice 4 things you can touch or feel, like your feet on the floor, the chair beneath you, or the air on your skin. Take just a moment to notice those things.

Next, notice 3 things you can hear, even if they're quiet – like the sound of your breath, the hum of the air conditioner, or the sound of a bird outside. Take just a moment to notice those things.

After that, notice 2 things you can smell, even if they're faint – like the scent of the room, the coffee in your cup, or the fresh air outside. Take just a moment to notice those things.

Finally, notice 1 thing you can taste, even if it's just the air – like the sweetness of your breath, the saltiness of your mouth, or the taste of the coffee. Take just a moment to notice that thing.

As you notice these things, what happens to the chest tightness and the voice?

Patient: I don't know — I did the 5-4-3-2-1 like you said. My chest eased a little and the voice got quieter for a moment, but it's still circling and my hands keep twitching toward my phone. It's sort of helpful, I guess, but it's draining — can we do another short grounding or breathing thing so I don't want to bolt?

Therapist: That's really brave of you to notice the draining feeling. When the chest tightness and the voice kept showing up, even with the 5-4-3-2-1, what if we tried something else together? A simple 4-count breathing pattern can help calm the nervous system and make room for what matters most.

Here's what I'd like you to try: take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4... and then breathe out through your mouth for a count of 4. Just focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to change it or fix it. 

Notice how your chest feels as you breathe in, and how it shifts as you breathe out. What happens when you keep that breath moving, even with the voice and the twitching hands?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the 4-count slowed me down a bit and my chest eased a notch, but that voice is still circling and my hands keep twitching for my phone. It's...kind of wearing me out, so can we try something really quick and concrete next? I'm worried I'll bolt.

Therapist: When the voice and the twitching hands kept showing up, even with the 4-count breathing, what if we tried just *one tiny step* to make room for what matters most? 

Here's a tiny experiment: I want you to make *one small decision* right now, about what you want to do next. Not about changing the thoughts or the feelings, just about what you want to *do*. What would it be like to take just one tiny step toward what matters most to you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess one tiny step would be to tell my partner I'll try staying at the next get-together for just 15 minutes and agree on an exit signal if I need to leave. It feels kind of scary and I'm already thinking of excuses, so can you help me rehearse what to say so I don't chicken out?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny step matters a lot to you. When you think of telling your partner, what's the one thing that's making it hard for you to say it out loud? Not the excuses, but what's holding you back from saying those 15 minutes?

Let's rehearse just saying it to yourself: "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling." What happens when you say those words to yourself, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what's stopping me is this fear they'll be disappointed or think I'm flaky, and that feeling of being exposed makes my chest clamp up. When I say "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling," my voice goes thin and I almost choke on it, like I want to take it back. Can we role-play that line once so I have a script to use?

Therapist: That makes sense. When you say "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling," what if you added just one tiny word to make it feel a little more like you? Like, what if you said it like this: "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard"?

Let's try it together: "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard." *pause* How does that feel?

Patient: I don't know — I guess that line felt a bit more honest, like it gives me permission, but my voice still goes thin and my chest clamps up when I try to say it. Can we role-play it once? Maybe coach me on how to open so I don't fumble.

Therapist: Let's try it together. I'll be your partner for this role-play. When you're ready, take a deep breath in and say the line: "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and check in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard." 

*Pause* What happens when you say it?

Patient: I don't know — I tried to say it and my voice went really thin, my chest clamped, and I almost took it back. It gave a tiny bit of relief, like maybe honesty matters, but I still feel shaky and want to fumble for an excuse. Can we role-play it once more with you coaching my opening line so I don't choke on it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer. When you're ready to try again, notice the sensation in your chest and throat before you say the line. What's the one thing that matters most to you about taking that tiny step with your partner? 

Take a deep breath in and say the line with me: "I'll try..." *pause* What's the one word that matters most to you right after that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess "stay."

Therapist: When you say the word "stay" after "I'll try," what happens to your voice and chest?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my voice goes thin and shaky and my chest really clamps down, like there's a knot in my throat. It makes me want to rush the words or bail. Can you help me with a simple opening line so I don't choke on it?

Therapist: It sounds like that knot is really strong. Let's try something tiny. When you're ready to talk to your partner about staying for 15 minutes, what would you like to *do* right now, *before* you talk about it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd like to write the line down and say it out loud once with you, so it doesn't feel like I'm making it up on the spot. Can we practice that now?

Therapist: Let's write the line down together. "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and checking in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard." 

Now, let's practice saying it out loud together. Just hear yourself say the words, without changing them or trying to make it sound perfect. Ready?

Patient: "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and checking in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard."

I don't know — saying it felt a little lighter, but my chest's still tight and my voice went thin. Can we do that once more, with you giving me the very first two words to start so I don't choke on it?

Therapist: Let's try it again, just with the first two words: "I'll try."

*pause*

What happens when you say that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess when I say "I'll try" my voice goes thin and my chest clamps, like there's a knot, and I want to rush the rest or stop. Can you say the next words with me so I don't choke on them?

Therapist: Let's try it together. When you say "I'll try", I'll say the next words with you: "staying for 15 minutes."

What happens when you say that together?

Patient: I don't know — when we say it together my voice still goes thin and my chest clamps, but I guess it felt a tiny bit less scary. Can you say "and checking in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard" with me so I can get through the rest?

Therapist: When we say the whole line together, what happens?

Patient: I don't know — saying it together made it feel a bit lighter, like the knot loosened a notch, but my chest's still clamped and my voice is thin and shaky. I guess I could try it for real, but can we role-play how my partner might respond after I say it so I don't freak out?

Therapist: Let's imagine what your partner might say. You've already said "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and checking in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard." Now, your partner responds with kindness and understanding.

Here's a possible response: "That sounds really brave and I appreciate you being willing to try. I'm here to support you, and if you need to leave at any point, that's okay too. We can check in whenever you feel ready."

What happens when you hear that response?

Patient: I don't know — I guess hearing that would ease my chest a tiny bit, like maybe they won't be mad. But then I worry it's too good to be true and that I'll still bolt or they'll get annoyed later. Can we role-play that response and maybe a couple other reactions so I know what to say next?

Therapist: Let's imagine different responses from your partner. You've already said "I'll try staying for 15 minutes and checking in with you about how I'm feeling, even if it feels hard." Now, your partner responds in different ways.

**Response 1: Kindness**
Partner: "That sounds really brave and I appreciate you being willing to try. I'm here to support you, and if you need to leave at any point, that's okay too. We can check in whenever you feel ready."

**Response 2: Surprise**
Partner: "Whoa, okay... I didn't expect that. But I appreciate your honesty. Can you help me understand what's going on for you?"

**Response 3: Concern**
Partner: "I can see why that would be hard for you. Is everything okay? Is there something specific that's making it feel that way?"

What happens when you hear these different responses?

Patient: I don't know — with the kind response my chest loosens a tiny bit and I might actually stay, but then I start worrying they'll be annoyed later. Surprise makes me panic and I usually deflect or say something vague like "it's fine" and try to change the subject. Concern makes me want to open up, I guess, but it also feels exposing so I often shut down and go "I don't know" — can we role-play that concern response next so I have a line to use?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to opening up when your partner expresses concern. Let's try to build on that. When your partner says "I can see why that would be hard for you. Is everything okay? Is there something specific that's making it feel that way?", what's one thing you could say to them that would acknowledge their concern without shutting down?

Here's a possible response: "It's just... I feel really overwhelmed when I think about staying for 15 minutes. It feels like it's too much, even when you're here to support me."

Notice how that response still acknowledges your partner's concern, but also tries to break down the feeling of overwhelm into something smaller. What happens when you say that?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I said that it'd feel a bit honest and my chest might loosen a notch, but then I'd worry I'm being needy or they'll think I'm fragile and I'd want to grab my phone or change the subject. Can we role-play that response once so I have a line to use?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about how your partner might react to that response. Let's try it anyway. When your partner says "I can see why that would be hard for you. Is everything okay? Is there something specific that's making it feel that way?", what's one small step you could take to open up to them, even if it feels scary? 

Notice that you don't have to say the whole truth, but just a tiny bit. What if you said "It's just... I feel really overwhelmed when I think about staying for 15 minutes" and then stopped there?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could say that, but my chest would clamp and I'd probably stop mid-sentence and reach for my phone. Can we role-play me saying it once and practice what to do if I go quiet?

Therapist: Let's try it. You've started: "I feel really overwhelmed when I think about staying for 15 minutes..." *pause* What happens next?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd trail off, my chest would clamp and I'd freeze up, probably grab my phone or blurt out "I'm fine" even though I'm not. Can you give me a really short line to say if I go quiet so I don't just bail?
