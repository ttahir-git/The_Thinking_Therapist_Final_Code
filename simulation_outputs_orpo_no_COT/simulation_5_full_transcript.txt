--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an older accountant and I just started a really demanding new job, and it's knocked me off balance. Lately I've been burying myself in hobbies—dive-bombing into knitting, model trains, whatever—mostly so I don't have to sit with the anxiety and weirdness of the change. I don't know, talking about it feels... uncomfortable.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like those hobbies have become a way to temporarily escape from the anxiety you're feeling about your new job. When you're diving into knitting or model trains, what's it like when that distraction starts to fade – not because you're "done" with it, but because the anxiety is still there?

Patient: When it fades, everything I was avoiding kind of rushes back—tight in my chest, mind racing, like I can't sit still. I don't know, I guess I just start another hobby or busy myself so I don't have to feel it. It leaves me drained and a bit guilty, but I keep doing it anyway.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: So when the anxiety shows up again, you feel like you're losing control – like your chest is tight and your mind is racing. It sounds like the urge to distract yourself with hobbies is a way to try to hold onto a sense of calm. What would it be like if, instead of pushing those feelings away, you could make room for them while you're still sitting with them – even if it feels hard?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it would feel really uncomfortable, like I'm lifting a lid on something I don't want to see. Maybe it'd be messy and overwhelming at first, but maybe it wouldn't be as tiring as always numbing myself—I'm not sure, it's hard to imagine actually doing it.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of sitting with that discomfort feels really daunting, like it's carrying a weight that's hard to bear. What if, instead of trying to imagine doing it, you simply noticed what it feels like to consider making room for that discomfort while you're still sitting with it – not to do it, but just to notice it, like you're holding a small space for it to be there?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice it my chest tightens and my mind starts jumping to the next thing I could do. I guess it makes me feel panicky and restless, like I need to get up and busy myself, and I'm not sure I can just sit with that. Can we slow down? I'm struggling to see how this helps.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that feeling of panic and restlessness is actually making it worse, not better. Let's try something small. When you notice your chest tightening and your mind jumping, what's one tiny thing you could do to make room for that feeling – just one tiny thing – without trying to fix it or change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess one tiny thing might be to put a hand on my chest and take a couple of slow breaths, just noticing the tightness instead of jumping up. It feels awkward and silly to do, and I'm already getting restless thinking about it — can we slow down? I'm not sure how this actually helps me yet.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Let's slow down even more. Just notice that you're already getting restless – that's the second step you're thinking about, not the first. What happens if, right now, you just *let* go of that thought about what you're doing – not the putting a hand on your chest or taking a breath – just let it be there while you sit with the tightness in your chest?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to just let it be, my chest actually tightens more and my mind bolts to the next thing—like the knitting or the next task at work. I feel kind of ridiculous sitting with it and start wanting to get up and busy myself. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how this helps and I'm getting restless.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the very thing you're trying to notice – the tightness in your chest – is actually getting bigger while you're sitting with it. That can be really confusing. What if, instead of trying to sit with it, you noticed it as something that's *already happening* – not as a problem to solve, but just as it is?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I think of it as just happening, it feels strange—like watching a little storm inside me that I can't do anything about. My chest tightens and I get this urge to pick up something and busy myself. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how this helps.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing it as a storm feels like a way to acknowledge it, but still try to fix it – like you're saying, "This storm is happening, but I should calm it down." What if, instead of trying to calm it down, you just noticed it as it is – the storm – while you're still holding your hand on your chest, even if it feels a little awkward?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I actually did that—hand on my chest, just watching the storm—it'd feel ridiculous and my chest would probably tighten even more. Maybe it'd make the urge to dive into a hobby less loud, or maybe it'd just be uncomfortable and pointless. Can we slow down? I'm not sure this is helping and I'm getting restless.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that even trying to notice it as a storm feels like it might not work – like it would still be uncomfortable and not really change what's happening. What if, instead of trying to make it work, you just *allowed* it to be there – not as a solution, not as a problem, just as it is – while you sat with your hand on your chest?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try letting it be with my hand on my chest, but it already feels awful and like I need to jump up and do something. Can we slow down? Or—can we talk about something less heavy for a minute, like this new model train I'm trying to finish?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the discomfort is still there, even with your hand on your chest. When you think about that model train, what would it be like to actually finish it – not as a way to distract yourself from the discomfort, but just as a way to engage with something you enjoy?

Patient: I don't know... I guess finishing it would feel nice — a bit of pride, like I actually completed something and my head might quiet down for a while. But I can already feel myself wanting to start the next kit so I don't have to sit with the other stuff. Can we talk about the paint for the caboose? I'm terrible at picking colors.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even the small accomplishment of finishing the model train feels like it might be lost to the next thing – the need to move on and avoid the discomfort. When you think about the paint for the caboose, what would it be like to pick a color that doesn't feel like it has to be "just right" – but instead feels like a small, calming act in itself?

Patient: I don't know... I guess a soft, dusty blue or a muted olive — something understated. Picking it might be a tiny, quiet choice that actually calms me for a moment instead of needing to be perfect. But I can already feel my mind wanting the next project so I don't have to sit with the rest — can we slow down?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even the small act of choosing a paint color feels like it might be lost to the need to move on. What if, instead of trying to calm yourself with the paint choice, you simply noticed the feeling of your mind wanting to move on – and then made a tiny choice to stay with the paint choice for just one moment, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try that — just stay with the paint choice for one breath and notice my mind itching to move on. It already feels a bit panicky and ridiculous, but maybe focusing on the brush and the dusty blue for one slow inhale and exhale could be okay; can we slow down? I'm not sure how this helps.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the panic and the ridiculousness is already helping – and that's a small step. When you take that slow inhale and exhale with the brush and the dusty blue, what would it be like if, instead of trying to make it work, you simply *allowed* yourself to be there – with the brush, with the blue, with the panic – not as a problem, not as a goal, just as it is?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I just allowed myself to be there with the brush and the dusty blue, it might feel a little less frantic — like my chest loosens a hair and the urge to start the next kit quiets for a moment. But it also feels scary and makes me restless, like I should be doing something else. Can we slow down? I'm not sure this is helping.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like allowing yourself to be there with the brush and the dusty blue feels like it might make the panic a little less loud – but also feels scary and makes you want to move on. What if, instead of trying to make the panic go away, you simply noticed it as it was – the feeling of restlessness, the thought "I should be doing something else" – and then made room for it to be there while you kept holding the brush and the blue?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice the restlessness while holding the brush and the dusty blue, but it makes me feel ashamed and frustrated—like I keep doing the same stupid thing and I'm irritated with myself. My chest tightens and I already want to put the brush down and start the next kit. Can we slow down? Maybe talk about brush tip sizes for the caboose for a minute — it's easier for me to focus on that right now.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the restlessness while holding the brush and the dusty blue feels like it's connected to shame and frustration – and that's making it hard to stay with the brush. When you think about the brush tip sizes for the caboose, what would it be like to focus on that right now, not to try to "fix" the restlessness, but just to notice what it would take to make room for the brush and the dusty blue while you talked about brush tip sizes?

Patient: I don't know... I guess talking about brush tips feels safer — it's concrete and I don't have to look at the other stuff. But even that brings up this stupid shame and frustration, like I always mess things up and it makes me tense. For the caboose I'd probably use a 00 round for the fine trim, a size 1 flat for the panels, and maybe a fine liner for the edges — can we stick with that for a bit? I'm already getting restless, but this is easier to focus on.

Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like even thinking about the brush tip sizes brings up that same shame and frustration – and that's making it hard to stay with the brush. But you're noticing that it's "easier to focus on" the brush tip sizes right now, which is a small step. What would it be like to try to notice the restlessness while you're talking about the brush tip sizes – not to change it, but just to notice it as it is, while you're making those concrete choices?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice the restlessness while we talk brush tips, but it brings up this stupid shame and frustration and my chest gets tight like it always does. Maybe focusing on something concrete will help — 00 round light pressure for the trim, size 1 flat for the panels, and a fine liner for the edges, watching the strokes. Can we stick with that a bit? I'm already getting restless.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the restlessness while talking about brush tips is still making the shame and frustration show up – but you're finding some small ways to make room for it. You're noticing the light pressure on the 00 round, the smooth strokes on the panels, and the fine liner's gentle touch. What would it be like to keep noticing those small, concrete things while your chest is still tight – not to try to change the tightness, but just to see what it's like to hold both the brush tip choices and the restlessness at the same time?

Patient: I don't know... I guess trying to hold both feels like my chest is getting squeezed and this stupid shame creeps in, like I always mess things up. The brush does help a little — watching the 00 round lay a thin line calms the restlessness for a beat — but I'm already feeling fidgety. Can we slow down? I'm not sure this is actually helping and it's making me uneasy.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like trying to hold both the brush tip choices and the restlessness is feeling like it's pushing the shame and self-doubt even harder – and that's making it hard to stay with the calm for even a beat. You're noticing that the brush is helping a little, but that's not enough to make the restlessness go away. What would it be like to let the brush tip choices be enough – not to try to fix the restlessness, but just to notice them as they are – and then see what happens if you let the restlessness be there too?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I let the brush choices be enough, it might quiet me for a tiny bit, but then this old shame and frustration starts bubbling up and my chest gets tight. I keep getting distracted—my hands feel jittery and I keep glancing at the clock—so it's hard to stay with it. Can we talk a bit more about the fine liner technique for the edges? That feels safer right now.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like letting the brush choices be enough feels like a small step, but it's not enough to keep the shame and frustration from showing up. You're noticing that the fine liner technique feels safer, which is a small anchor for you right now. What would it be like to hold onto that small anchor – noticing the fine liner's gentle touch on the edges – while still noticing the restlessness in your chest? Not to try to fix it, but just to see what it's like to hold both things at the same time.

Patient: I don't know... I guess holding the fine liner on the edge helps for a beat—the thin steady line calms my hands a little, but then the shame and restlessness creep back and my chest tightens. I'm already jittery and keep glancing at the clock, so it's hard to hold both. Can we stick with the fine liner technique for a bit—like how to keep pressure consistent—because talking about that feels safer and maybe I can try noticing the restlessness while I do it?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding the fine liner on the edge is giving you a small sense of calm, but it's not enough to keep the shame and restlessness at bay. You're noticing that your hands are jittery and you're glancing at the clock, which is making it hard to focus. But you're willing to try noticing the restlessness while you work with the fine liner technique. What if, while you're holding the fine liner steady, you made room for the restlessness to be there – not to change it, but just to notice it as you're creating that thin line?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice the restlessness while I draw that thin line, but my hands are jittery and my chest's tight and I feel stupidly ashamed like I always mess things up. The steady pressure of the fine liner calms me for a beat, but my mind's already darting to the next kit — can we keep on the fine-liner pressure and maybe talk through how to keep it steady? I'm getting anxious.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the restlessness while drawing the fine liner is still making the shame and self-doubt show up – but you're finding a small moment of calm in the steady pressure of the fine liner. You're noticing that your mind is already darting to the next kit, which is making it hard to stay with the steady pressure. What if, instead of trying to fix the restlessness, you focused on what's working for you – the steady pressure of the fine liner – and how you can use that as a small anchor to help you stay present?

Patient: I don't know... I guess focusing on the steady pressure could help — like keeping the fine liner light and constant, breathing in for three and out for three as I draw, maybe counting each stroke so my head doesn't dart. It feels stupid and I get ashamed, like I always mess things up, but that tiny ritual might anchor me for a moment. Can you walk me through one slow stroke? I'm already getting restless and need something concrete to hold onto.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like focusing on the steady pressure of the fine liner is giving you a small sense of control – and that's what matters right now. Let's take one slow stroke together. I'll guide you through it. *pauses* Take a deep breath in for three... *pauses* and exhale for three... *pauses* as you draw the fine liner steady and light on the edge of the paper. Just focus on making one small, steady stroke. Don't worry about the restlessness or the shame – just notice it as you draw.

Patient: I don't know... I tried the breath and made the slow stroke — the line stayed steady for a second and my hand felt a little less jittery, but then that stupid shame flickered up and my chest tightened again. I'm already glancing at the clock and feeling restless, so can you guide me through another slow stroke, counting with me and reminding me to keep the pressure light?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the small moment of steadiness you had with the fine liner is still worth holding onto – even if the shame and tension show up again. Let's try another slow stroke together. I'll count with you. *pauses* One... *pauses* Two... *pauses* Three... as you draw the fine liner steady and light on the edge of the paper. Remember, just one small stroke at a time. Don't worry about making it perfect – just focus on keeping the pressure light and even. What happens if you let the shame and tension be there for just one more second, while you focus on that small stroke?

Patient: I don't know... I tried holding it for one more second and, weirdly, the line stayed steady and my hand calmed for a beat, but then that shame just rushed back and my chest tightened. Can you count me through another slow stroke and remind me about keeping the pressure light? Talking about the next step—like how many passes to even out the edge—feels easier right now.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame and tension for just one more second didn't make it go away, but it's still worth holding onto – especially because it's connected to the small moment of steadiness you had with the fine liner. Let's try another slow stroke together. I'll count with you. *pauses* One... *pauses* Two... *pauses* Three... as you draw the fine liner steady and light on the edge of the paper. Remember, you've already noticed how to make it stay steady for a second – what if you could make it stay steady for another second, just to give yourself a tiny bit more control?

Patient: I don't know... I can try to hold it another second, but my hands are jittery and that stupid shame keeps creeping in like it always does. Can you count me through it again and keep reminding me to keep the pressure light? I'm already restless and need something concrete to focus on.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck between the shame and the need to keep drawing. Let's try to break it down even smaller. *pauses* One... *pauses* Two... *pauses* Three... as you draw the fine liner steady and light on the edge of the paper. I want you to focus on just one tiny part of that line – the very tip of the fine liner. Just notice what it feels like to hold it there, without trying to change it or make it perfect. *pauses* One... *pauses* Two... *pauses* Three...

Patient: I don't know... I tried holding the tip like you said—the line stayed steady for a beat, then that stupid shame rushed back and my chest clenched. I'm jittery and keep glancing at the clock; can you count me through one more slow stroke and remind me to keep the pressure light? I need something concrete to hang onto right now.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame and tension is really hard right now. Let's focus just on that tiny part of the line again – the tip of the fine liner. *pauses* One... *pauses* Two... *pauses* Three... as you hold it steady, even if your chest is clenching. I want you to notice what happens when you let the pressure be light – what's that like for you? Not to change it, just to notice it.

Patient: I don't know... when I let the pressure be light it calms my hand for a second—the line stays steadier—but then that stupid shame and frustration rushes back and my chest tightens and I start fidgeting. I'm really jittery and my eyes keep darting to the clock, like I can't focus and feel kind of useless. Can you count me through one more slow stroke and keep reminding me to keep the pressure light? I need something concrete to hang onto right now.
