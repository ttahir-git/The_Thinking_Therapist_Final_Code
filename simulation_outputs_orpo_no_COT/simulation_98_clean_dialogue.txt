Patient: I've been feeling stuck and directionless lately, like my whole identity's wrapped up in being unemployed and I don't know what matters to me beyond that. I get lonely, my PTSD flares, and I end up doubting every choice I make. Honestly, I've tried talking before—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like when you say "I don't know what matters to me beyond that," what matters most to you isn't the "what" – it's the feeling of being stuck and uncertain. When you mention PTSD flaring and doubting choices, what happens in those moments – like your chest tightens or your mind starts racing – if you could make room for it without trying to push it away?

Patient: My chest gets tight, my breathing gets shallow, and my mind just loops—memories and worst-case thoughts like I'm back there. I've tried sitting with it before; letting it in usually just feels like giving it more room to swallow me. How is noticing supposed to change any of that when the feeling just sits there and won't let me think straight?

Therapist: When you say "noticing doesn't change any of that," what if, instead of trying to make room for the feeling, you noticed it as just that – a sensation in your chest, a sensation in your breath – not as the story that's happening when it shows up?

Patient: I get the idea, but when I try that it still feels like a heavy weight — calling it "tightness" or "shallow breath" doesn't quiet the memories or the panic. I've tried grounding and labeling before; it settles me for a minute and then the loop drags me back and I feel useless again. How is that supposed to help me figure out who I am beyond being unemployed?

Therapist: When the loop comes back, what happens when you're not trying to make room for it – but just notice it, like you said – while you're still sitting with that sense of being stuck?

Patient: I try to notice, but it honestly just feels like watching the same bad movie over and over — the thoughts don't change, they just loop louder. My chest tightens, I go flat and small, and then I start asking myself what the point is, like I'm just... waiting to be fixed. I've done the breathing and naming before and it helps for a breath or two, but then the stuckness slams back — how is noticing supposed to actually help me figure out who I am beyond being unemployed?

Therapist: What matters to you in those moments – when you feel stuck and the thoughts are loud – isn't that you're waiting to be fixed; it's that you're waiting to know what matters to you.

Patient: I guess what matters, in the quiet moments, are small things — my sketchbook, the radio in the morning, the cat's purring, the few times someone actually asks how I’m doing. But when the panic hits it all feels hollow, like I'm just patching a hole and not actually living. How is knowing that supposed to help me build anything real, and not just cling to little comforts until the next flare-up?

Therapist: When you say those small things feel hollow, what would it mean to try one of those small things – like drawing in your sketchbook – not as a way to avoid the panic, but as a way to make room for it while you're already moving towards something that matters to you?

Patient: I tried drawing once while my chest was tight — my hands shook and I kept watching the panic like it was a clock I couldn't stop. Maybe it would mean tolerating the feeling while still doing something, but it just felt like papering over a hole instead of fixing anything. How is doing that supposed to actually make me less stuck?

Therapist: When you say it felt like "papering over a hole," what would it be like to make room for the feeling of not being able to draw – the feeling of being stuck – *while you were drawing*?

Patient: It feels like trying to hold two things at once—the panic and the pencil—my hands shake, my chest tightens, and I end up staring at a messy page that just reminds me I can't do it right anymore. Maybe doing it anyway would mean I could tolerate the mess, but honestly it just becomes more proof I’m failing at even small things. How is tolerating the mess supposed to help me actually find anything that matters beyond this stuck, useless feeling?

Therapist: What if the mess on the page wasn't about being "useless," but about being in a space where you could still be there – with the pencil, with the panic, with the feeling of failure – *while you were trying to draw*?

Patient: I get what you're saying, but to me that messy page just turns into proof I'm useless—it's not "being there," it's failing in front of myself. I've tried sitting with it a few times and the panic usually wins, so honestly I'm not sure how tolerating the mess helps me find who I am beyond being unemployed. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this—can we slow down and be more concrete about what that would actually look like?

Therapist: Let's take a small step back. When you say the messy page becomes proof you're useless, what would it mean to you if, for just one moment – while you were drawing – you didn't think that? Not that the drawing was perfect, but that you were there with the pencil anyway.

Patient: Maybe it would mean I could tolerate being imperfect and still keep doing small things, like letting the pencil move even if my hands shake. But honestly—I don't see how tolerating a shaky sketch turns into anything real for me; how is that supposed to help me figure out who I am beyond being unemployed? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed—can we slow down and be concrete about one tiny next step that doesn't feel like another test I'll fail?

Therapist: Let's look at one tiny next step, just to make things clearer. What would it mean for you to try drawing for just 30 seconds – not because you're good at it, but because you're curious about what would happen if you let your hands move while your chest was still tight?

Patient: How is 30 seconds supposed to help? Still... I guess I can try—I'll set my sketchbook and let my hand move for 30 seconds, even if it shakes and feels pointless. I'm nervous and a bit overwhelmed; can you tell me exactly what to notice while I'm doing it so I don't just spiral?

Therapist: I can guide you. When you're holding the pencil, notice the sensation of it touching the paper. *pause* Not the thought about what you're drawing, or whether it's good enough – just the sensation of the pencil touching the paper. *pause* And when your hand starts to shake, notice that too. Not as a problem, but as a physical sensation – like a vibration in your arm.

Patient: Okay... I'm holding the pencil now. I can feel the tip scratch the paper, my fingers are cold, my hand's shaking and my chest's tight and breath's shallow — the loop's already whispering things like "you can't do this." I did about 30 seconds, but it just feels like proof I can't even draw calm; how is noticing the vibration supposed to change that, and what exactly should I watch for next?

Therapist: You did 30 seconds. Now, notice the moment you stop drawing – without pushing to keep drawing. What's the first thing that shows up when you let go of the pencil?

Patient: The first thing is this hollow silence, then that loud, mean thought: "that was useless." My chest tightens and I get this urge to shove the sketchbook away like hiding the proof I tried and failed. I keep thinking every small try just adds to the tally of failures—how is noticing that supposed to make any of it change? I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and be concrete about the very next small thing to do from here?

Therapist: The thought "that was useless" is already there. What if, while noticing that thought, you didn't try to push it away or make sense of it? What if you just *watched* it – the thought, the chest tightness, the urge to shove the sketchbook away – without trying to change it?

Patient: I try that, but "just watching" ends up like staring at the same angry loop — my chest tightens, my breath speeds, and the urge to shove the sketchbook away gets louder. I can try to watch it now, but how long am I supposed to sit with it before it just becomes more proof I'm stuck — how is that supposed to help? I'm feeling overwhelmed; can we slow down and be concrete about one tiny thing to notice next so I don't just spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to watch it – the chest tightens, the breath speeds – is already setting up for another loop. What if, just for a tiny instant – a single breath – you didn't try to push the tightness away or make sense of it? What would happen if you just *noticed* it while it was already happening?

Patient: Alright—one breath. I notice my chest rising and that mean thought: "you're useless," and the tightness doesn't let up. It still feels pointless—how is a single breath supposed to do anything to help me actually get unstuck?

Therapist: One breath. Now, what happens when you notice the thought "you're useless" right after the breath? *No change*.

Patient: No change — the thought's still loud, my chest's tight, and my breath's shallow like before. It just feels like naming it doesn't move it, like putting a label on a stain doesn't make it disappear. How is this supposed to help me actually get unstuck? I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and pick one tiny concrete next step that doesn't feel like another test I'll fail?

Therapist: Let's take it one tiny step. Before you try to do anything with that thought, notice what's happening right now – with your hands, feet, and body – while you're still holding the pencil. What's the sensation in your fingers?

Patient: My fingertips feel cold and a little numb, the pencil digs into the pads of my fingers and there's a fine tremor — like a buzzing under the skin when I try to grip. How is noticing that supposed to help me feel less stuck? I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and be concrete about the very next tiny thing to do?

Therapist: Notice the tremor – the buzzing under the skin – right now. What would happen if you didn't try to stop the tremor or fix it? *Just notice it*.

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to notice it — my hand's buzzing, the tremor runs up my arm, my fingers feel numb and the pencil's digging in. But my chest's tighter and my thoughts are racing so I keep getting pulled away; if I don't try to fix it it just feels like I'm letting the panic win. How is "just noticing" supposed to stop that or help me feel less stuck? I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down and be concrete about one tiny thing to do next while my hands are shaking?

Therapist: You're noticing the tremor, the numbness, the digging sensation – and still feeling the chest tightness, the racing thoughts. What if, instead of trying to stop those thoughts, you just *made room* for them while you're noticing the tremor?

Patient: I'm trying to make room but my head's all over — thoughts racing, my hand's still buzzing and my chest's tight. If I just "make room" it feels like I'm letting it take over; how is that supposed to help me get unstuck? Be concrete — what exactly should I do with the thought while my hand's shaking so I don't just spiral? I'm overwhelmed; can we slow down and pick one tiny thing to try right now?

Therapist: When your hand's shaking, what happens if you *let the pencil move* – just a tiny bit – while your thoughts are racing?

Patient: When I let the pencil move a little, it just makes these frantic, shaky lines and my chest clamps down harder — my thoughts start racing faster and I get this sick, jittery feeling like I can't hold anything together. Part of me notices a tiny, ridiculous flicker of "I did something" but it's drowned out by the loop telling me I'm failing. Tell me exactly what to look for or do next while my hand's still shaking so I don't just spiral — I need something concrete.

Therapist: Notice the tiny flicker of "I did something" – not the racing thoughts or the chest tightness. What would happen if you looked at that flicker for just one breath while your hand's still shaking?

Patient: Okay—I try to look at that flicker for one breath; I notice a tiny "I did something" but my hand's still buzzing and my chest clamps down. The "it's worthless" thought slams back in and drowns it out—I'm barely gripping the pencil and feel like I'm about to lose it. How is focusing on that tiny flicker supposed to stop me from spiraling? Be concrete—what's the single next tiny thing I should do right now while my hand's shaking?

Therapist: You're noticing the flicker, the buzzing, the chest tightness – and the thought that it's worthless. What happens if you *let go of trying to hold onto the pencil* for just one second – while you're still noticing the flicker?

Patient: I tried letting go for a second — the pencil slipped like my hands wanted to give up, and I felt a jolt of panic, like something inside me expected the whole thing to fall apart. My chest tightened, my thoughts zoomed to "you'll never get anywhere," and I got this sudden urge to hide the sketchbook and stop altogether. How is that supposed to help? I'm really rattled right now — tell me one very specific thing to do next so I don't just spiral.

Therapist: You're noticing the panic, the chest tightness, the thoughts – and the urge to hide. What would happen if you *put the pencil back down on the paper* – just for a moment – while those thoughts are still racing?

Patient: Okay — I set the pencil back down, barely touching the paper, and my hands are trembling more and my heart's racing; the panic spikes and I get this urge to bolt. It feels like every little movement just proves I can't hold anything together, so I'm skeptical this is actually helping. Tell me exactly what to notice next while it's like this — how long, and what would count as a real step instead of another pointless exercise?

Therapist: You're noticing the trembling, the racing, the panic – and the urge to bolt. What would happen if you *just kept the pencil on the paper* – not moving it, not trying to do anything with it – for just one single breath?

Patient: I try to keep the pencil there for one breath and my hand trembles, my chest tightens, and the breath feels ridiculously shallow like it's taking forever. It just feels like proof the panic wins — how is holding it there for one breath supposed to change anything when the loop doesn't budge? I'm really rattled right now — give me one very specific, tiny thing to do next while this is happening so I don't just spiral.

Therapist: You're noticing the trembling, the tightness, the shallow breath – and the feeling that the panic wins. What would happen if you *allowed the breath to be the tiny thing you held onto for two seconds – just two seconds – while the panic kept racing?

Patient: Two seconds? How is that supposed to help? Fine — I'll try it, but I'm not promising it'll do anything.

I hold my attention for two seconds and it’s the same: breath barely moves, chest so tight it hurts, my hands buzzing and my mind jumping all over — the thought "this is useless" is already yelling. It didn't change the panic, it just felt like a tiny pause before the loop came back. 

Tell me exactly what to do next — how long do I keep doing this, and what exactly should I be looking for so I don't just spiral? I'm feeling really rattled and distracted right now; can we slow down and be concrete about one very small next step?

Therapist: You're noticing the two-second pause – and the thought that it didn't change the panic. What if, instead of trying to change the panic, you *focused on the sensation of the breath moving slightly* – even if it's just a tiny bit – for just one more second?

Patient: One more second... fine. I notice the faint lift in my chest, like hardly anything, but my breath's still shallow and the loop's already yelling—so it barely feels different. How is noticing that tiny air supposed to stop the loop, and what exactly do I do next after that second so I don't just spiral?

Therapist: You're noticing the tiny lift – and the thought that it barely feels different. What happens when you *make room for the loop to be there* – not as the problem, but just as it is – for just one more second?

Patient: I try — I make room for the loop for a second, and all I get is the same sharp tightness in my chest, my hands buzzing, and that nasty “you’re useless” thought rattling louder. Making room just feels like letting the panic watch me fall apart — how is one more second supposed to change that? I’m really overwhelmed and jittery right now; give me one specific, tiny thing to do next that won’t feel like another test I’m going to fail.
