Patient: I've been feeling totally overwhelmed by this sadness and this lack of motivation since the loss of a loved one, and it's really starting to mess with my relationship. I work as a social worker, so I keep telling myself I should be able to handle it, but I just keep doubting myself. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and it doesn't stick, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the weight of this sadness and self-doubt is really showing up in your relationships and work. When you say "I'm skeptical this will help," what happens when you imagine being able to try something new, even if it doesn't "stick"? Would that just be another thing to worry about?

Patient: Honestly, picturing trying something new just makes me more anxious — it feels like one more thing to fail at and more proof I'm not coping. I've tried new routines before and they never stick, then I end up beating myself up and pulling away from my partner. Maybe if it didn't feel like a huge task or like I was being told to "fix" myself, I'd be willing to try, but... how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the anxiety around trying something new is really tied to the fear of not being able to cope. When you say "it feels like a huge task," what happens to that feeling if you weren't trying to solve it right now?

Patient: If I stop trying to solve it, it doesn't go away — it just becomes this dull, heavy ache that sits in my chest and makes everything feel pointless. Sometimes it's numbness, sometimes it spikes into guilt or panic and I just withdraw from my partner, and honestly, the idea of "small steps" just feels like setting myself up to fail — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like the heaviness and numbness are already showing up, even when you're not trying to solve it. When you say "the idea of small steps just feels like setting myself up to fail," what would it be like to notice that thought as just a thought, without having to act on it right now?

Patient: Maybe it'd take the sharp edge off and make the panic less automatic, but I honestly don't know how to just "notice" a thought without judging it — I end up spiraling every time. I've tried mindfulness-y stuff before and it never sticks, so how is that supposed to help me now when I already feel like I'm failing?

Therapist: It sounds like mindfulness-y stuff has felt like another thing to try to control or fix, which can make it hard to stick with. What if, instead of trying to control the thought, you could just notice it as it shows up in your chest, right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it, but I'm scared it'll just spiral — when I pay attention to that tightness in my chest I start telling myself I'm weak and I end up withdrawing. How is that supposed to help when focusing on it just feels like proof I'm broken? If you're asking me to notice it, can you guide me through one very short, simple step — like 30 seconds — so it doesn't turn into another overwhelming project?

Therapist: Let's try something tiny. I'm not asking you to notice the thought, but just the sensation of the tightness in your chest right now. Can you bring your attention to that tightness, just for 30 seconds, without trying to change it or tell yourself anything?

Patient: Okay, I tried that for about 8–10 seconds and my chest just got tighter and my thoughts started spiraling. It felt like proof I'm weak, so I stopped — how is that supposed to help when paying attention makes it worse? Can we try something even shorter, like 10 seconds with you counting me through it, because I get overwhelmed on my own.

Therapist: I'm not going to tell you to "stop" or "try harder." When your chest got tighter, what happened to the thought when you noticed that tightening?

Patient: When I notice the tightening the thought just gets louder — like "you're weak, you can't handle this" — and I start spiraling and want to pull away. It feels like noticing just gives the thought more fuel, so how is that supposed to help? If we're doing this, can you guide me for just 10 seconds and count me through it so I don't get lost?

Therapist: I'm just going to count with you for 10 seconds. When you notice the tightening, I'll say "1" and when you notice the thought, I'll say "2."

Patient: Okay, I'm ready. I'm bringing my attention to the tightness now — I'm nervous it'll spike, so please count slowly and gently, and I'll tell you if I need you to stop.

Therapist: One...

Patient: When you said "One..." I felt the tightness right away and the "you're weak" voice jumped in loud enough to make me want to pull away. It's not worse than before, but it's definitely still there. I'm willing to try the next step — please go slow, and say "stop" if it sounds like I need you to.

Therapist: Two...

Patient: When you said "Two," my chest spiked and my thoughts just started racing — I'm jittery and having trouble staying with it. Can we slow down or pause? I really worry this will just feed the "you're weak" voice, so how is that supposed to help when paying attention makes it louder?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing what matters to you – that the tightness and thoughts make it hard for you to stay with the exercise. Instead of trying to "fix" it, what if we just noticed it together, without adding anything else?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it with you, but I'm really jittery and distracted right now — my chest is tight and the "you're weak" voice jumps in fast. How is just noticing supposed to help when it just feeds that voice? If we're doing it, please guide me through a very slow, 10-second thing and tell me exactly what to do so I don't spiral.

Therapist: Let's take it apart. When I say "slow," what happens to your body when you actually slow down your thoughts?

Patient: When I try to slow my thoughts my breath gets shallow, my chest tightens, and my heart starts racing — I get jittery and everything feels louder, not calmer. How is slowing supposed to help when it just seems to fuel the "you're weak" voice? If you want me to try, give me one tiny, exact thing to do (like "inhale 3, exhale 4") and count me through it slowly.

Therapist: Let's try something tiny. When your chest gets tight, I want you to notice it, and then... *pause* just a tiny bit more. I want you to notice that tiny bit of tightness, and then... *pause* notice the breath that's happening right now.

Patient: I tried that for a few seconds and my chest actually got tighter — my breath went shallow and my mind started racing, so I'm really jittery and distracted right now. I don't get how noticing the breath helps; it usually just feeds the "you're weak" voice and makes me pull away. Can we do one tiny, exact thing — like you count "inhale 3, exhale 4" slowly with me — or else I'll just spiral.

Therapist: Let's try "inhale 4, exhale 4." I'll count slowly with you: inhale 4...

Patient: Okay, I'm trying—inhale...1...2...3...4. My chest tightened on three and now my heart's racing; the "you're weak" voice just got louder. How is that supposed to help when this just spikes my anxiety? Can we do a much shorter one—like inhale 2, exhale 2—and go really slow?

Therapist: Let's try "inhale 2, exhale 2." I'll count slowly with you: inhale 2...

Patient: Inhale...1...2. Exhale...1...2. My chest just tightened and my heart's racing — I'm really jittery and distracted right now; this is making that "you're weak" voice louder. How is this supposed to help when it just spikes my anxiety? Can we go even slower or do something else because I'm worried I'll spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the breath isn't helping as much as you hoped. Let's try something else. When your chest gets tight, what happens if you didn't have to notice it right now?

Patient: If I don't notice it, it kind of sinks into this dull, background ache — I go numb and disconnect, and then later it spikes into panic and guilt and I pull away from my partner. Right now I'm jittery and can't focus; the "you're weak" voice is loud and telling me noticing will only make it worse. How is not noticing supposed to help with that? If we're going to try something, give me one tiny, exact grounding thing to do right now and count me through it slowly — please.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness is already triggering a lot of pain. Let's try something small to help you stay with the present moment, even if it feels hard. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground right now.

Patient: Okay, I tried shifting to my feet but I'm really jittery and can't focus — I can't even tell where my feet end and the floor starts, and that "you're weak" voice is shouting that this is pointless. How is noticing my feet supposed to help when everything's so scattered? If we're doing this, give me one tiny exact thing to do (like "press your heels into the floor and count to 5") and count me through it slowly.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to focus on your feet feels like too much. Let's try something tiny to connect with your body. I want you to notice where your mouth feels right now.

Patient: Okay... my mouth feels kind of dry and a little numb, like there's weight on my tongue. I can't focus long before that "you're weak" voice pipes up and says this is pointless. How is noticing my mouth supposed to help, and if we're doing this, give me one tiny exact thing to do so I don't spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your mouth is already triggering the "you're weak" voice. Let's try to find something even smaller to focus on. I want you to notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nose right now.

Patient: Okay... I can barely notice a coolness at the tip of my nose before my chest tightens and that "you're weak" voice takes over. My mind's racing and I don't have much energy to focus — how is just noticing this supposed to help? If we're doing it, guide me: count me through three slow breaths, one at a time, very slowly.

Therapist: I'm going to count very slowly with you. When you're ready, take one breath in...

Patient: Okay... I'm breathing in now — inhale...1. Exhale...1. My chest's tight and that "you're weak" voice just got louder. Keep going, but really slow and gentle — count me through two more breaths, and tell me again how this is supposed to help when it just spikes my anxiety.

Therapist: I'm going to count very slowly with you. When you're ready, take one more breath in...

Patient: Okay... inhale...1. Exhale...1. My chest tightened and my thoughts just started racing — I'm drained and it's exhausting to keep doing this when it feels like proof I'm weak. How is this supposed to help when it just spikes my anxiety? Can we try something different or even slower?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. I want to try something different. Instead of focusing on your breath or noticing your body, I want you to notice what matters most to you right now. What matters most about being able to show up for your partner, or about feeling strong?

Patient: I guess what matters is not pushing my partner away — I want to be able to show up without feeling like a burden, and to stop doubting that I'm ever enough for them. But I'm exhausted and that "you're weak" voice already says thinking about values won't change anything — how is that supposed to help when I can barely make it through the day?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between wanting to be there for your partner and feeling like you're not enough. I want to try something that might feel small, but could help. When you think about that "you're weak" voice, what if you could notice it as just one thought, without having to be it?

Patient: Maybe I could try that, but honestly when I tell myself it's "just a thought" it usually just gets louder — it feels like denial, not relief. How is that supposed to help when it just sounds like minimizing my pain? I'm pretty drained right now, so if we're going to try it, give me one tiny, exact thing to do—like say the thought out loud once or give the voice a name—and guide me through it slowly.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "just notice it" feels like it's not working for you. Let's try something that might feel small, but could help. I want you to say the thought out loud, exactly as it shows up, without trying to change it. Can you try saying it to me right now, without stopping or judging it?

Patient: "You're weak. You can't handle this. You're a burden and you'll just ruin everything."  

There — I said it, and my heart's racing and I feel kind of scattered. How is that supposed to help? Tell me one tiny thing to do next, slowly.

Therapist: It sounds like saying it out loud was actually really hard. When you said it, what happened to your chest right after?

Patient: It clenched—got tighter and heavier and my breath went shallow, like a wave of panic, and my heart started racing. I felt exposed and ashamed and that "you're weak" voice just got louder. I'm kind of wiped out—tell me one tiny, exact thing to do next, slowly, because I'm worried if you don't I'll just spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like saying it out loud was really painful. When you notice that wave of panic coming up, I want you to notice it, but just for a moment. Can you take one tiny step back from it, just for 2 seconds, while you say to me: "I'm feeling this wave of panic right now."

Patient: "Okay... I'm feeling this wave of panic right now."

My chest tightened and my breath went shallow — it kind of exposed everything and the "you're weak" voice got louder, not quieter. How is that supposed to help? If we're doing another step, give me one tiny, exact thing to do and count me through it slowly.
