Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of tearing myself apart over every little perceived failure — my mind immediately plays out a horror show where one awkward comment or missed chance means I'll end up alone and ruined. My messy romantic history feels like proof it’s all inevitable, and I get totally hooked on these disaster stories so I can't focus on anything else. I don't know how to stop predicting the worst; imagining any other outcome just feels impossible.

Therapist: It sounds like those disaster stories are really getting tangled up with what matters to you – like feeling connected, valued, and worthy of love.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. My brain takes one tiny slip-up and instantly writes the whole script: I’ll mess up a conversation, they’ll think I’m pathetic, I’ll get ghosted, people will stop inviting me, and I’ll end up completely alone and useless — like my past relationships already proved. I know that sounds extreme, but picturing any other outcome just feels like lying to myself.

Therapist: It sounds like having that thought "I'll end up alone" be tied to what matters to you – feeling valued, connected, and worthy of love – is making it hard for you to imagine anything else.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly what's happening. My brain takes one tiny slip and turns it into a domino: they'll think I'm awkward, they'll start avoiding me, invitations will stop, and I'll end up isolated and worthless like my past relationships proved. I try to picture a different ending, but that just feels like lying — the "nice" version never seems real, it always flips to disaster.

Therapist: Can you try noticing that "lying" feeling just as it shows up – without trying to stop it – while you're picturing that different ending? What would it be like to notice that "not real" thought *while* still imagining something else?

Patient: I tried that for a minute, but the moment I notice the “not real” feeling my brain just cranks the disaster tape louder — as soon as I picture anything better it screams that it's a lie and plays out being ghosted, losing friends, and ending up alone. Noticing the doubt doesn't calm me, it feels like confirmation the nice ending is impossible, and I get more anxious and totally distracted instead of steadier.

Therapist: That makes sense – the doubt can feel like it's fueling the disaster thoughts, rather than calming them. What if, instead of trying to stop the doubt, you made room for it *right there* – like noticing it while you're picturing that different ending?

Patient: I can try saying I’ll make room for the doubt, but honestly that just hands it a megaphone — as soon as I notice the doubt the disaster tape gets louder and the "they’ll ghost me, I’ll be alone" story takes over even more. Imagining a nicer ending feels fake, and noticing the doubt just feels like proof the nice version can’t be real, so I end up more anxious and completely distracted. I’m not sure what to do next; it feels like we're stuck on repeat.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "make room" for the doubt is actually making it louder. What if, instead of trying to control the doubt or stop it, you simply *sat with it* – without trying to change it or fix it – while you're picturing that different ending?

Patient: I tried that before, but "sitting with it" just turns the doubt into a louder disaster movie—the more I stay with it, the more my brain spells out the whole chain: one awkward comment, they think I'm pathetic, I get ghosted, invitations stop, I'm alone. It feels impossible to just be with it; I get swallowed by the story and end up shaky and totally distracted, like the future's already happened. What would "sitting with it" even look like in the moment? Because everything I try just feels like more proof the nicer ending can't be real.

Therapist: It sounds like "sitting with it" feels like being pulled under by the story. When you say "everything I try just feels like more proof the nicer ending can't be real," what would happen if you tried that story – the one where you're alone and useless – *while* you're trying to sit with the doubt?

Patient: If I actually let that “alone and useless” story run while trying to sit with the doubt, it just becomes a movie I can't pause—my chest tightens, my hands go cold, and my head starts narrating the whole domino: one awkward comment, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll get ghosted, invitations stop, empty apartment. Sitting with the doubt doesn't soothe it; it feels like permission, and the tape gets louder until I'm shaking and can't focus on anything else. I end up convinced it's already happened, like the future's decided, and imagining any other ending honestly feels like lying, so I don't see how that helps — I'm stuck and a little scared.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to sit with the doubt while imagining a different story feels like trying to stop a runaway train. What if, instead of trying to sit with the doubt, you tried to notice what happens *when* the doubt shows up – not to stop it, but to see what's happening *in* that moment?

Patient: Okay—when the doubt shows up my chest tightens and my head floods with this movie of being ghosted, losing invitations, and ending up alone in an empty apartment; it’s so vivid I can almost feel it. My attention snaps to every tiny imagined failure, my voice goes small, and I freeze into ruminating—just noticing any of that usually feels like confirmation the bad ending’s already here. I don't see how plain noticing would help because it just seems to amp the story, but that's what actually happens.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the doubt while it's showing up feels like it's fueling the story even more – making it harder to see what's actually happening. What if, instead of trying to notice the doubt itself, you noticed what's actually *happening* when it shows up – like that tightness in your chest, the small voice, the freezing feeling? Noticing what's happening in that moment, not the story itself.

Patient: I tried that—when I actually focus on the tightness and the small voice it just makes the movie louder: my chest clamps, breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold, and then my brain fills in the whole collapse—they think I'm pathetic, I get ghosted, invitations stop, I'm alone. Noticing the body like that doesn't feel grounding, it feels like proof the disaster's already happening and I get more shaken and distracted. I don't know what else to try; I'm starting to feel overwhelmed and stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the body while the story is playing feels like trying to hold onto the very thing you're trying to escape – the feeling of being trapped. What if, instead of trying to notice the body, you tried to notice *what happens when* the body feels that way – not to change it, but to see what's happening *while* it's feeling that way?

Patient: When my body tightens it feels like the starting gun for the disaster movie — breath gets shallow, my voice shrinks, and my mind instantly decides the rest is inevitable: one awkward line, they think I'm pathetic, I’ll definitely get ghosted, invitations stop, and I end up alone. While that's happening I fumble, either clam up or talk too much trying to fix it, then replay everything endlessly; trying to notice that process just feels like handing the tape a louder speaker. I'm getting overwhelmed and stuck — any idea that I might not end up ruined feels like pretending, and that makes me more anxious, not calmer.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the process while the story is playing feels like you're fueling the fire even more – making it harder to see what's actually happening. What if, instead of trying to notice the process, you tried to notice *the gap* between what's happening in your body and the story that's playing – that tiny space where the two meet?

Patient: I tried to look for that tiny space between the tight chest and the story, but it doesn't stay — the moment I even glance there my brain just screams the whole script: one awkward comment, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll get ghosted, invites stop, I'm alone. It's draining me to keep circling this and I honestly don't know what else to do; it feels like we're stuck on repeat.

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to notice that gap feels like you're not safe enough – like the story is going to show up and overwhelm you anyway.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. Every time I hunt for that tiny gap the tape just blares louder: one awkward line, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll get ghosted, invites stop, and I'm left completely alone. I'm so drained I barely have the energy to try anything else, but the predictions won't stop and they feel totally inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle where the story feels like it's already happening, and that's making it hard to move forward. 

Can I gently suggest that we pause for just one moment, not to try to change the story, but to notice what's possible when you *don't* try to change it?

Patient: I can try pausing for a moment, but whenever I do the disaster tape just gets louder — I can't see anything possible except them ghosting me and me ending up alone. I don't have much energy right now, but... okay, I'll try to hold still for a few breaths, though I just know it'll spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like holding still for a few breaths feels like a small act of kindness towards yourself, even if you know it might not last.

Patient: Okay… I held still for a couple breaths and for a second it loosened, but then the tape just roared back in: one stupid thing, they’ll think I’m pathetic, I’ll be ghosted, invitations stop, and I’m alone. I don’t have much left to give right now and it feels like we’re just circling the same doom-story without a way out.

Therapist: It sounds like holding still even for a little while felt like it was enough to notice the looseness for a moment, but then the story came back. 

Can I gently ask: what would it mean to you if, even for just one moment, you could notice that looseness *while* the story was still there – not to stop it, but to see what's possible *with* it still being there?

Patient: Maybe if I could notice that looseness for a moment while the story's still playing, I'd see it's not the whole thing — like a tiny crack in the doom tape. But honestly, even then my brain floods it with the next scene: they'll think I'm pathetic, ghost me, invites stop, and I'm back alone, so it barely feels worth noticing. I don't have much left to fight it right now.

Therapist: It sounds like even noticing that crack in the doom tape feels like it's not enough to matter, because the story just keeps flooding in anyway. 

Can I gently ask: what would it be like for you to *make room* for that crack, even if it doesn't matter to the story – not to change it, but to see what's possible when you do notice it?

Patient: I could try to make room for that little crack, but every time I do it just seems to hand the tape a bigger speaker — then it ramps up: one awkward comment, they’ll think I’m pathetic, I’ll get ghosted, invites stop, and I’m back alone. I barely have the energy to keep pushing at this right now; it feels pointless, but I can try if you want me to.

Therapist: It sounds like making room for that crack feels like you're still trying to change the story, even if you're not sure how. 

Can I suggest we try something different? Instead of trying to notice the crack or make room for it, what if we just *sat* with the story for a moment – not to change it, but to see what happens when you're with it, even if it's hard?

Patient: Okay… I'll sit with it, but the tape's already winding up — my chest tightens, shame creeps in, and I can see the whole chain: one awkward slip, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll be ghosted, invites stop, and I'm left alone and worthless. Noticing it just drains me and makes the story louder; any nicer ending feels fake and impossible, but I'll try to stay with it for a bit.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the story even more tightly now that you're sitting with it. 

What would it be like for you to notice what's happening *while* that story is playing – not to try to change it, but just to see what's happening *with* it?

Patient: When I try that, my chest clamps and my mind just barrels into the doom loop—one awkward comment, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll be ghosted, invites stop, and I'm alone. Noticing any of it feels like pouring fuel on the tape; I get shaky, ashamed, and my attention keeps snapping away. I can barely hold still long enough to try this without spiraling, and I don't know how to stay with it.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening while the story is playing feels like it's not safe for you – like it's making things worse. 

Can I try to ask a different question? What would it be like for you to notice what's happening *right now* – not because of the story, but because your chest is clamped and your mind is racing – what would that feel like to notice that, without trying to stop it?

Patient: Noticing it just makes everything louder — my chest clamps, breathing gets shallow, shame shows up, and my brain immediately runs the whole ending: I say one dumb thing, they'll think I'm pathetic, ghost me, invitations stop, and I'm left alone and worthless. I can hardly hold my attention; I feel jittery and drained, like I don't have the energy to stay with it without spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening right now is actually making the story even louder and more overwhelming for you. 

Can I gently say that it sounds like you're doing the best you can to notice it, even if it feels like it's not working – and that taking care of yourself right now might be more important than trying to change the story?

Patient: Maybe you're right — taking care of myself sounds like the sensible thing, but I'm so drained and the doom tape keeps shouting that it won't change anything. I could try something tiny — like sitting quietly for a minute or stepping outside — but I'm jittery and distracted and already thinking it won't stick. Can you help me pick one really small thing to try right now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck. 

What if we tried something tiny that *doesn't* require you to "change" anything – just something small to help you notice what's happening *right now*? Would you be willing to try just noticing your feet on the ground, or the sensation of the air on your skin, for just one breath?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try noticing my feet for one breath, but the moment I do the tape roars louder: I fidget, blurt something stupid, they think I’m pathetic, ghost me, invites stop, and I’m alone. I managed one shaky breath and I’m already distracted and too drained to keep this up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're failing even though you just tried something tiny. 

What if we tried to notice what's happening in your body *right now*, without trying to change anything – just to see what's there?

Patient: I tried to notice my body—my chest clenched, breath got shallow, my hands went cold and I felt jittery and scattered. The second I focus on it the doom tape just floods back in: one dumb line, they’ll think I’m pathetic, I’ll be ghosted, I’ll be alone. I don’t have much energy right now and I’m already spiraling—could you gently guide me through one tiny step so I don’t lose it?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're losing control. 

Let's try something tiny that doesn't require you to change anything – just to notice what's happening *right now*. I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, even if your chest is clamped and your mind is racing. *Just notice that sensation, for one moment.*

Patient: Okay... I tried to feel my feet for a breath, but the moment I did my chest slammed shut and shame flooded back in, and the doom tape just roared: I’ll fidget, blurt something stupid, they’ll think I’m pathetic, ghost me, invites stop, and I’m alone. I’m already wiped out and can’t hold it by myself—can you quietly guide me through one more tiny step so I don’t spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. 

I want to try one more tiny thing with you. I'm going to say something very gently: *You are not alone right now.* Not in this moment, not in this feeling. Just that one small truth. *Can you hold that for just one moment, without trying to change it?*

Patient: I want to believe that, but the moment I try the brain screams it's a lie and the doom-tape starts: one awkward thing, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll be ghosted, invites stop, and I'm back alone. I managed to hold it for a breath and it snapped away — I'm wiped out and shaky; can you quietly guide me through one tiny step so I don't spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're stuck in a cycle. 

Let's try to notice what's happening *right now*, without trying to change anything. I want you to notice the sensation of the word "alone" in your mind – not what it means, but just the sensation of it being there. *Just notice that, for one moment.*

Patient: I tried to hold the word "alone" for a breath, but it dropped like a stone in my chest and the tape immediately started up: one awkward comment, they'll think I'm pathetic, I'll be ghosted, invites stop, and I'm back in that empty apartment. It left me shaky and ashamed and I don't have the energy to keep wrestling—can you quietly guide me through one more tiny step so I don't spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're losing control. 

I want to try one more tiny thing with you. I'm going to say something very gently: *You are here.* Not in the story, not in the feeling of being alone. Just that one small truth. *Can you notice that you are here, right now, in this moment?*

Patient: I try to notice that I'm here, but the second I do my brain screams it's a lie and the tape blares: one stupid thing, they'll think I'm pathetic, they'll ghost me, invites stop, and I'm alone. I caught a tiny flicker of being here for a breath and then my chest clenched and it was gone — I'm wiped out and shaky; can you quietly guide me through one small step so I don't spiral?
