Patient: I'm an older artist and since I started this really demanding program I've been feeling more on edge than I expected. Small interactions with colleagues or instructors flare me up into anger or frustration and then I just spiral into self-doubt. I don't know, talking about it feels really uncomfortable and I guess that's part of the problem.

Therapist: It sounds like when those small interactions happen, your body feels like it's under pressure, and that pressure then spills over into self-doubt. And when you try to talk about it, the discomfort feels like a big part of the problem itself. 

What would happen if, for just a moment, you allowed that discomfort to be present – not trying to push it away or make it go away – but just noticing it as you sit here right now?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it'd feel raw and tight in my chest, like everything's louder and I want to bolt. I usually end up thinking I'm failing and try to change the subject. Can we take it slow? I'm not great at sitting with this.

Therapist: The tightness in your chest makes sense. When you say you want to bolt, what matters most to you about that feeling – is it the feeling itself, or the thought that's already there: "I'm failing"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it's the thought "I'm failing" that really stings, but the tightness in my chest is what makes it feel urgent and makes me snap. It becomes this loop where the thought and the feeling feed each other and then I end up angry at myself or whoever's there. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed talking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like the tightness in your chest is what makes the thought "I'm failing" feel even more unbearable – like it's what's driving that urgency. And when you try to snap out of it, you're already moving towards anger.

Would you be willing to notice that tightness for just a tiny bit longer – not to change it, but just to see what it would be like to sit with it while you say "I'm failing"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but it's really hard. The tightness gets sharper and saying "I'm failing" makes my throat close up and I just want to leave. Can we slow down? I'm not sure I can stay with it for long.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought "I'm failing" is really close to your breath right now. When your throat closes up, what matters most to you about staying with that tightness – is it being able to make room for your breath, or something else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess being able to breathe would help, like so I don't panic or make a scene and embarrass myself in front of others. But it also feels like if I really sit with it I'll admit I'm not up to this, and that thought makes me want to run. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: The fear of not being able to handle it, combined with the fear of what others might think – that's a really tough mix. 

Would you be willing to notice that tightness in your chest, just for one tiny breath – as you say "I'm not up to this"?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try one breath, but my chest's already so tight and saying "I'm not up to this" feels like admitting defeat. Can we take it really slow? I'm starting to feel like I might bolt.

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already responding to the thought "I'm not up to this" – the tightness is getting even worse. 

What if, instead of trying to make room for that thought, you just noticed it as you breathe in – without judgment?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to notice it as I breathe in, but my breaths are shallow and my chest just clamps down. The moment I notice it my mind's already saying "you're weak" or "they'll see you fail," and then I get hot and angry at myself. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel like I might bolt.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is already jumping in – noticing that thought ("you're weak") and turning it into anger ("they'll see you fail"). 

Would you be willing to notice that thought as you breathe in – just for a tiny fraction of a second – without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try for a tiny moment. As I breathe in I notice that "you're weak" voice — it's this tight, buzzing thing in my chest and throat and I get hot and want to flee. Can we slow down? I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: The thought "you're weak" shows up, and with it, that tightness and heat. 

What matters most to you right now – is it being able to stay with that feeling while you breathe, or is it being able to move away from it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I mostly want to move away from it — to stop feeling hot and embarrassed and not make a scene. But a small part of me thinks maybe staying could help, and that scares me because it feels like admitting I'm not up to this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: The desire to move away from that feeling – to avoid the heat and embarrassment. And a small part of you wondering if staying might actually be helpful – even if it feels scary because it means acknowledging that you're not up to this. 

What would it be like to notice that small part of you that wants to stay – just for a tiny moment – while you're already feeling the need to move away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess that small part feels like a tiny, scared ember — curious but so much smaller than the panic. When I notice it I can almost breathe a little, but then my chest tightens and I want to run. Can we go really slow? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The panic is still there, but the small part of you wanting to stay – that curious ember – is showing up. 

What would it be like to notice that ember while you're already feeling the panic – not trying to change it, but just noticing it right there – while you breathe in?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it feels like a tiny, scared ember — when I breathe in for a moment it gets a little warmer and my chest loosens a hair. But then the panic clamps down again and I want to look away or change the subject. Can we take it really slow? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: The ember is getting a little warmer, and your chest is loosening – just for a moment. 

What would it be like to notice that warmth in your chest, even as the panic is still there – not trying to change it, but just being with it – while you breathe out?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to notice the warmth that shame rises up — it's this familiar, hot sinking feeling that makes me clench and want to hide. Breathing out helps for a sliver, but then the shame and irritation snap back and I get angry at myself. Can we slow down? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The shame is showing up – that familiar, hot sinking feeling. 

What would it be like to notice that shame while you're already breathing out – not trying to push it away, but just being with it – right here, in this moment, where your chest feels clenched?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to notice the shame it just gets louder, like a knot that tightens and I get hot and furious at myself. Breathing out gives a sliver of relief, but then the shame snaps back and I want to make a joke or change the subject so I don't have to feel it. Can we slow down? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: The shame is getting louder – that knot tightening and the hot fury. 

What would it be like to notice that knot while you're already breathing out – not trying to push it away, but just being with it – even when it feels like it's getting louder?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to notice the knot while breathing out it just gets louder — this familiar shame rising up that makes me hot and furious and I clench even more. Breathing out loosens it for a sliver, then the shame snaps back and I want to make a joke or look away. Can we slow down? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: The knot is getting louder, and the shame is still rising up. 

What would it be like to notice the knot while the shame is still there – not trying to push it away, but just being with both of them – even when they feel like they're getting louder?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to notice both the knot and the shame they just feed each other — my chest clamps up, I get hot, and I start getting furious at myself like I might snap at someone. Then I want to make a joke or change the subject so I don't have to sit with that sinking shame. Can we slow down? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: The knot and shame are feeding each other – that cycle of clamping up, getting hot, and snapping at yourself. 

Would you be willing to notice that cycle *right now* – not trying to change it, but just seeing it happen – even when you feel like you're going to snap at someone?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try, but the moment I notice that cycle the shame and frustration just flood me and I get hot and tight and feel like I might snap at someone. My breathing goes shallow and I want to make a joke or change the subject to get away. Can we slow down? I'm already feeling overwhelmed.

Therapist: The cycle is happening – that shame and frustration flooding in, making it hard to breathe, and wanting to snap at someone. 

Notice that your body feels that way *right now*, even when you think you're going to react that way. What matters most to you – is it being able to stay with that feeling, even if it feels like it's going to take you out of control?

Patient: I don't know... I guess part of me wants to stay so I can maybe learn something, but most of me feels too drained and ashamed — like if I let it in I'll lose it and make a fool of myself. Can we go really slow? I'm already getting overwhelmed.

Therapist: The weight of what matters to you – wanting to learn something, even when the shame feels so heavy. And the fear of letting it in, of losing control. 

What if, instead of trying to push away the shame, you could make room for it just for one tiny breath – not to change it, but just to notice it while you breathe in?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try one tiny breath, but just thinking about it makes that old shame flare — hot and stupid — and my chest clamps like it always does. Can we go really slow? It's getting heavy and I'm having a hard time keeping up.

Therapist: The shame is showing up again – that hot, stupid feeling that makes your chest clamp. 

Let's not try to change that feeling, just for a tiny moment. What if you could notice it while your chest is already clamped, and you're already feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I tried to notice it, it'd feel like this heavy, hot clamp that makes me small and stupid. For a moment naming it loosens things a hair, but then the shame spikes and I just want to hide or make a joke. Can we go really slow? I'm having a hard time keeping up.

Therapist: The shame is showing up again – that heavy, hot feeling that makes you small and stupid. 

Notice how that feeling is already here, even as you're thinking about it – the shame is already present, like a weight in your chest. What if, instead of trying to push it away, you could just *be* with it for one tiny moment – not to change it, but just to notice it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try to be with it for one tiny breath, but it drags up that familiar, stupid failure feeling and my chest just clamps. I'm already so drained and it's hard to keep talking about this—can we go really slow? I don't like staying on it for long, it makes me want to change the subject.

Therapist: The shame is showing up again – that familiar, stupid feeling that makes your chest clamp. 

Notice that your chest is already clamped, even before you think about it – it's not just happening when you're thinking about the shame. What if, instead of trying to push the shame away, you could make room for it while you breathe – not to change it, but just to notice it while your chest is already clamped?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to make room for it while my chest's already clamped it gives a tiny, thin loosen for a second, then that stupid hot shame surges and I get furious at myself. Can we go really slow? I'm already feeling worn and want to look away.

Therapist: The loosen is just a tiny crack in the clamping – but the shame is still there, and it's making you feel furious. 

Notice that the fury is already there, even as you're thinking about it – it's not just happening when you're thinking about the shame. What if, instead of trying to push the shame away, you could just notice the fury while your chest is still clamped – not to change it, but just to see it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to notice the fury it's this hot, buzzing pressure behind my ribs and I feel small and stupid all over again. For a beat I can see it, then I just want to look away or crack a joke so I don't lose it—can we go really slow? I'm running out of steam talking about this.

Therapist: The fury is showing up again – that hot, buzzing pressure behind your ribs. 

Notice that you're already looking away – that's what happens when you try to protect yourself from feeling small and stupid. What if, instead of pushing the shame away, you could just notice the smallness and stupidity while you look away – not to change it, but just to see it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to notice the smallness while I look away it just feels pathetic and hot, like that old failure feeling, and I clench up. For a beat I can sort of see it, then I want to make a joke or change the subject so I don't have to stay—can we go really slow? I'm running out of steam.

Therapist: The smallness is showing up again – that hot, pathetic feeling that makes you clench up. 

Notice that you're already wanting to change the subject – that's what happens when you feel like you can't handle the smallness. What if, instead of trying to push it away, you could just notice the smallness while you're looking away – not to change it, but just to see it, even if it feels like it's too much?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to notice it while looking away it just feels pathetic and hot, like that old failure, and I clench up. For a second I can sort of see it, then I want to make a joke or change the subject—can we go really slow? I'm getting kind of worn out.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to notice the smallness while looking away – that's okay. 

Let's take a tiny step back. What would happen if you just made room for the smallness for one tiny breath – not to notice it, but just to be present with it while you're looking away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I can try one tiny breath, but even that brings up that old, hot, stupid shame and my chest just clamps. For a beat it loosens, then I feel pathetic and want to make a joke or change the subject. Can we go really slow? I'm getting worn out.

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny breath is really hard to manage – that shame is showing up again. 

Let's try something really small. What would it be like if you just noticed that shame *while* your chest is clamped – not to change it, but just to see it right there?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I try to look at the shame while my chest's clamped, it's that hot, stupid knot — a tiny slackening for a beat, then the shame snaps back and I want to look away or make a joke. Can we go really slow? Maybe we could talk about something smaller for a moment, like my studio routine — I'm getting kind of worn out.
