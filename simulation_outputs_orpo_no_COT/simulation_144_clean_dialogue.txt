Patient: Lately I've been burying myself in hobbies—painting, learning new crafts, taking every creative project I can find—to avoid the grief since the house emptied out. If I actually let myself feel it, my brain says I'll spiral: my work will fall apart, I'll miss shows and lose galleries, people will stop caring, and I'll end up alone and broke. I know that sounds dramatic, but my mind just jumps straight to the worst and is totally sure it's going to happen.

Therapist: What a heavy weight you're carrying around that fear of losing control when you let yourself feel the grief.

Patient: Yeah, it feels like a constant pressure—like if I actually sit with the grief everything I’ve built will crumble. I shove myself into projects to keep moving, but the moment I slow down my brain supplies the whole collapse: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, friends drift, I can’t pay rent, end up alone and I've ruined my life. I know people say that’s unlikely, but I can't help believing the worst is just waiting to happen.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of losing control of your work is deeply entangled with the feeling of losing yourself.

Patient: Yeah, exactly — if I actually slow down I can already see the whole collapse: miss deadlines, galleries stop showing my work, commissions dry up, friends drift away, and I end up in debt and totally alone. I know that sounds extreme, but my brain treats it like a law, not a worry, and I can't seem to let any other possibility in. I just... I can't help getting hooked on that story.

Therapist: So when you imagine letting go of the grief, what's happening in your body when that "collapsing" story comes up – is it a tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, or something else?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, like I'm about to black out, and my stomach knots up until I feel sick. My hands shake and I get this jittery restlessness—I have to pick up a brush or start something right away to drown it out. When those sensations hit, the collapse story feels like proof, so I can't even picture any other outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like when that tightness and restlessness show up, you're already "on" the collapse story, even before you start making moves.

Patient: Yeah — as soon as my chest tightens that collapse tape starts playing and I'm already two steps into the worst-case: missing deadlines, galleries dropping me, losing friends, ending up alone. My hands itch to start a project because that actually dulls the panic, but it never feels like a real fix and then I beat myself up later. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling — it all just feels inevitable.

Therapist: When the tightness hits, what if you could notice it without trying to "fix" it right away?

Patient: I can't just notice it — if I sit with that tightness it feels like I'm opening the door to the whole collapse: missed deadlines, galleries dropping me, friends leaving, me spiraling into debt and loneliness. So the second it hits I have to do something creative or I'll let it happen — that's how my brain sells it. I know that's probably not rational, but I can't picture a world where noticing it doesn't turn into disaster, and then I beat myself up for numbing it.

Therapist: It sounds like the tightness feels like a bridge to the worst-case scenario, and that's what drives your need to distract yourself with creativity.

Patient: Yeah, that's it — it literally feels like a portal: if I let the tightness be, the whole collapse starts playing out in my head — miss deadlines, galleries bail, commissions dry up, friends drift, I'm broke and alone. I try to tell myself other things could happen, but my brain calls those lies — like, how could I possibly keep going if I slow down? I hate that I need to numb it with projects, and I also hate that I can't stop believing the worst.

Therapist: Would you be willing to try noticing that "portal" feeling right now, without trying to push it away or make it go away – just to see what might be possible if you didn't need to "fix" it?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to notice it, but I already feel like I'm about to be hijacked. My chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, my stomach knots and my hands start shaking — and the collapse tape is already on: miss deadlines, galleries bail, commissions dry up, friends drift, I'm broke and alone. I'm feeling really overwhelmed doing this — can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with it without reaching for a project.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the tightness is actually making it worse – and that's okay.

Patient: Yeah, it definitely ramps up — the moment I try to hold it the collapse tape goes full volume: missing deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions vanish, friends drift, I'm broke and alone. My chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, my hands shake and I feel this urgent need to grab a brush to stop it. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know how to sit here without immediately doing something.

Therapist: It sounds like the "stop it" part is really important to you, but that's not what's happening when you try to notice – the tightness is already there, no matter what you do.

Patient: I hear you, but I can't just let it be — the second I try my head kicks into that collapse tape like clockwork: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions dry up, friends drift, I end up broke and alone. My chest tightens, my breathing goes shallow, and I literally have to grab a brush or it feels like everything will definitely fall apart. I'm really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down? I don't know how to just notice this without trying to fix it.

Therapist: It sounds like the "fixing" part is actually what matters most to you right now – not the tightness itself.

Patient: Yeah — fixing is everything. If I don't do something right away the whole collapse starts playing on loop: miss deadlines, galleries bail, commissions dry up, friends drift, I'm broke and alone. The urge to grab a brush is like an emergency brake — I seriously can't sit with the tightness without starting a project, and thinking about other outcomes just feels like sugarcoating. I'm really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down? I don't know how to hold this without numbing it.

Therapist: It sounds like the "emergency brake" is what matters most to you right now – that feeling of needing to do something to stop the worst-case scenario.

Patient: Yeah... that's it. The emergency brake feels like the only thing stopping the collapse — if I don't grab a brush right away I can already see missing deadlines, galleries dropping me, commissions gone, friends drifting, me broke and alone. This is draining to even say — can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with it without numbing.

Therapist: Let's take one tiny step back from needing to fix it. What if, instead of grabbing the brush, you just made room for that "emergency brake" feeling to be there – not to stop the collapse, but just to notice it – right now, as we sit here?

Patient: Okay... I can feel that brake — chest tightens, breathing goes shallow, hands start to shake — and the collapse tape is already on: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions dry up, friends drift, I'm broke and alone. It makes me feel dumb and useless that I'm stuck on this, and I really don't see how just noticing it won't let the whole thing start, so my hands are itching for a brush already.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness makes you feel like you're stuck in a loop – and that's really hard to bear.

Patient: Yeah... it feels like I'm stuck in that loop, and I hate how ashamed and stupid I feel for not being able to just sit with it — the moment I notice the tightness the collapse tape starts: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions dry up, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. I don't know how to stop reaching for a brush.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-criticism are really close to the surface – and they're making it hard for you to even notice the tightness, because they're so loud.

Patient: Yeah... the shame just swallows everything — as soon as it gets loud the collapse tape kicks in: miss deadlines, galleries bail, commissions vanish, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. It feels pointless to try another angle because my brain insists that's the only possible future, and I don't know how to sit here without reaching for a brush.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is so big that it's already "done" the collapse – made the worst-case scenario already happen, before you even tried to notice the tightness.

Patient: Yeah... it already feels decided — the shame makes it feel like the collapse is done: miss deadlines, galleries stop showing me, commissions vanish, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. I feel so stupid and worthless that any pause seems like the moment it all becomes real, so my hands are already itching for a brush. Can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with this.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is what's making it feel like the collapse is already happening – and that's what's keeping you from even trying to notice the tightness.

Patient: Because the shame tells me a pause is proof — if I sit even a second my brain screams that the collapse is already happening: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions dry up, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. It drags up this old, humiliating thing and I just freeze, so noticing the tightness feels like admitting it's real; my hands are already itching for a brush. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without numbing.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is what's making the pause itself feel like proof of the worst-case scenario – and that's what's keeping you from even trying to notice the tightness.

Patient: Yeah... that's exactly it — the shame makes any pause feel like proof, and I can already see the collapse playing out: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, commissions dry up, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. My head's all over the place and I can barely follow you — my chest's tight and my hands are itching for a brush. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay here without numbing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to even hold the thought of slowing down without the shame telling you it's proof – that's really tough.

Patient: Yeah... the shame just snaps on and says a pause is proof, so the collapse tape kicks in: miss deadlines, galleries bail, commissions dry up, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. My head's fuzzy and I can barely follow—my hands are already twitching for a brush—can we slow down? I don't know how to sit with this without numbing.

Therapist: It seems like the shame is so loud that it's already "done" the collapse – made the worst-case scenario already happen – even before you tried to notice the tightness.

Patient: Yeah... it already feels finished — the shame makes it feel like the collapse is a done deal: missed deadlines, galleries stop showing me, commissions vanish, friends leave, me broke and alone. My chest tightens and my head fuzzes and I just want to grab a brush because arguing with that feels impossible. Can we slow down? I’m having trouble staying with this.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is what's making it feel like the collapse is already "done" – and that's what's keeping you from even trying to notice the tightness.

Patient: Yeah... it feels like the shame already signed the verdict — the collapse is done and noticing it would just make it true. My hands are already itching for a brush and I can't picture any other outcome without feeling ridiculous. Can we slow down? I don't know how to stay with this.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame has become a kind of truth for you – a truth that feels like it's already happened, even before you try to notice the tightness.

Patient: Yeah... it really does feel like the shame has already decided everything — like it's pointless to even try because the collapse is already happening: missed deadlines, galleries gone, friends gone, me broke and alone. I'm frustrated and embarrassed that I keep getting stuck in that, and I don't know how to take even one tiny pause without it feeling like proof. Can we slow down? Maybe help me with one tiny thing I can do right now that isn't numbing.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame has become so powerful that it's making it hard to even imagine taking a small step without it feeling like the worst-case scenario is true.

Patient: Yeah... I can't even picture a tiny step without my brain already finishing the disaster movie — one quiet minute and I'm missing deadlines, galleries bail, friends leave, I'm broke. I want help with one small thing I can do right now that isn't numbing, but I feel stupid asking because I already know it'll just lead to collapse. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of not being able to escape the "disaster movie" is what's holding you back from even trying to take that tiny step – and that fear is making you feel like asking for help would be admitting that you're not strong enough.

Patient: Yeah... asking for help already feels like admitting I'm weak — like the collapse tape will proof it: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, friends leave, I'm broke and alone. I want a tiny step — maybe a 30-second breathing thing or sending one short text to a friend — but I keep thinking even that will kick off the disaster. Can we try one tiny, concrete thing together? I'm scared it'll fail, but I'm stuck and I don't know what else to do.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of not being able to control the outcome is what's holding you back from even trying to take that tiny step – and that fear is making you feel like you're stuck.

Patient: Okay... I can try one tiny thing — maybe a 30‑second breathing thing or sending a really short text to one friend — but I'm already sure it won't work: it'll just postpone the collapse—miss deadlines, galleries bail, friends think I'm flaky, and I'll be right back to being broke and alone. My chest's tight and my hands are twitching and I can barely follow, so can we slow down and do the breathing together, step by step? I'm scared it'll fail, but I'm stuck and I don't know what else to do.

Therapist: I can see that you're already imagining what might go wrong with the tiny step, and that's making it hard for you to take it.

Patient: Yeah... I get that — the second I think about the breath my brain races to the end: miss deadlines, galleries drop me, friends think I'm flaky, I'm broke and alone. I want to try, but I'm already halfway to grabbing a brush — can you guide me through one slow breath, step by step?
