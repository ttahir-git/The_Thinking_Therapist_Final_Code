Patient: I've been avoiding even small get-togethers with my few close friends because the moment I think about going, my mind spins up a whole disaster: I’ll say something awkward, they’ll laugh or look away, then they'll stop inviting me and I’ll end up alone again. I'm an old software developer — I know how irrational it sounds, but it feels like that chain of events is inevitable, so I just don't go.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of those small get-togethers is triggering a lot of anxiety for you. What happens when you imagine that moment just before you decide not to go – when that "disaster" thought shows up, and you feel like you're stuck in that chain of events?

Patient: It hits me fast — I see myself saying something dumb, everyone laughing, my face going red, and then they quietly stop inviting me and I end up alone. My heart races, my head fogs, and it feels like the whole night is already ruined before I even get out the door. I try to tell myself it might go okay, but I can't actually believe it; the disaster story feels like the only realistic outcome.

Therapist: So when you notice that "disaster" story showing up, and your heart racing, and your head fogging – what matters to you in that moment, not about the thought itself, but about what you'd be doing if you could just make room for it?

Patient: What matters is being able to sit there, actually listen, maybe make a small joke or ask a question, and feel like I belong instead of the whole night turning into a panic spiral. But the moment I try to picture that, my mind instantly runs the worst script — the joke bombs, they laugh at me, they start excluding me, and before long I'm cut off and alone — so "just being there" feels impossible and naive. I want that calm, but I can't seem to trust it; it just feels like a glitch in reality.

Therapist: It sounds like the story of "disaster" feels so strong, it's like your whole "being able to sit there" – your desire to belong and feel calm – is getting lost in the noise. What would it be like if, for just a tiny moment, you could notice that "glitch" without trying to fix it or change it?

Patient: I try to, but the moment I notice it it's like opening a console and every tiny error message blooms into the whole catastrophe: joke flops, they laugh, invitations stop. Noticing doesn't feel like it calms anything — it just hands my brain more evidence to keep the disaster story running, and I freeze up. I know that sounds stuck, but I can't imagine that watching it would actually stop the chain.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that glitch feels like it's making things worse, like you're feeding the disaster story. What if, instead of trying to notice it, you could *make room* for that feeling – just for a moment – while you're actually getting ready to go to the gathering?

Patient: I’ve tried that in my head, and it just makes the disaster script louder — like giving the worst-case a chair at the table so it can tell its story louder and then it definitely happens. I want to be able to sit there calm, but when I make room for the feeling I get flooded and the whole chain (joke bombs, they laugh, I’m excluded) feels inevitable, so I can’t see how that would help.

Therapist: It sounds like making room for the feeling feels like fueling the disaster story, making it louder. What if, instead of trying to make room for the feeling, you could try *noticing it while you're already getting ready to go* – while you're still standing at the door, putting on your shoes?

Patient: If I try to notice it at the door, it just hands the disaster script a megaphone — I picture myself tripping getting my shoe on, saying something stupid to cover it up, everyone laughing and slowly excluding me after that. My heart pounds, my hands go numb, and I end up frozen with the door half-open, convinced the night's ruined before it starts. I get why you're suggesting it, but honestly I can't see noticing that without it exploding into the whole chain — that idea feels unrealistic and only makes me more stuck.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing it while getting ready feels like a recipe for disaster – the image of yourself tripping, saying something stupid, and everyone laughing and excluding you just shows up even louder. What if, instead of trying to notice it while getting ready, you could try noticing *what's happening right now* – just this one moment, standing here, looking at the door?

Patient: Even looking at the door right now just triggers that same movie: my heart thumps, I imagine tripping on the mat, spilling my drink, blurting something dumb, everyone laughing and slowly stopping the invites. I want to stand there calm and actually go in, but my mind's fortune-teller makes that feel impossible, like noticing only makes the disaster louder. Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening right now, even with the door in front of you, still triggers the same story – and that's exhausting. I'm not trying to fix it or make you notice something else, but rather... what would it be like to *stop noticing* that story, just for a moment – while you're still standing there, looking at the door?

Patient: Honestly, trying to stop noticing just feels like shoving the fortune‑teller into the attic — it doesn't go away, it comes back louder and then the whole disaster script explodes: I trip, I blurt something stupid, they laugh, and the invites stop. I can't see how "not noticing" wouldn't just let it sneak up and ruin the night later. Can we slow down? I'm getting overwhelmed and I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to stop noticing feels like trying to silence the fortune-teller, but it's still there, and that's making things worse. Let's take a step back together. What if, instead of trying to notice or not notice, we just *speak of* the story – what it means to you, when it shows up, and what matters most about what might happen when you go to that gathering?

Patient: The story is this relentless loop: the moment I think about walking into the room I see myself tripping, blurting something stupid, everyone laughing, and then the invites stop and I'm left alone. It shows up anytime I'm about to do something social—just a sight of the door—and it's tied up with this old fear from losing someone, like the worst parts will replay and I'll lose people again. I want to belong and not be excluded, but my brain's fortune‑teller says the worst outcome is certain, and thinking otherwise just feels naive and unrealistic.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is deeply tied to a feeling of being seen as not enough, like if you're not careful, the "worst parts" will show up again and you'll lose people. That must be a really hard place to be. What if, for just a tiny moment, you could tell that story to yourself – without trying to change it or fix it – and instead, look at what's left when you let it be there?

Patient: When I tell the story to myself it doesn't make it smaller — it plays on a loop in perfect detail: I trip, blurt something desperate, they laugh, the invites stop, and I'm back where I started. What's left when I let it be is this heavy certainty and a hollow loneliness, like the outcome is already compiled and will run unless I stop it — and honestly, any other outcome feels naive and unrealistic. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like telling the story to yourself still feels like trying to stop it – like you're trying to hold onto something that's slipping away. What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you could *make room* for the feeling of that certainty and that loneliness? Not to fix it, but just to notice it – while it's still there – when you look at the door.

Patient: Making room for that certainty feels like opening the error log in my old code editor — every tiny warning explodes into a full crash report and the whole disaster runs again: I trip, I blurt something, they laugh, the invites stop. When I try it my chest tightens and I freeze; it doesn't soften the story, it gives it root access. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like making room for the certainty is still triggering the crash report – and that's making it even harder to move forward. *Noticing that* – not trying to fix it – is what matters right now. What if, instead of trying to make room, you could *just be* with the tightness in your chest – while you're still standing there, looking at the door?

Patient: If I try to just be with the tightness it feels like giving the fortune‑teller a countdown — my chest seizes, my hands go numb, and I can already see the whole script: I trip, I blurt something stupid, they laugh, and the invites stop. I'm getting overwhelmed; can we slow down? It doesn't feel like sitting with it would help — it just makes the disaster feel more inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to be with the tightness feels like it's fueling the disaster story – like you're trapped in that cycle. Let's take a step back from that. What if, instead of trying to sit with the tightness, you could *ask yourself one question* – right now, standing in front of the door: "What matters most to me about going into this gathering?"

Patient: Mostly, I want not to lose the few people I have — to sit there, listen, maybe say something small, and actually feel like I belong. But the fortune‑teller in my head immediately runs the whole movie — I trip, blurt something, they laugh, the invites stop — so I feel trapped and overwhelmed; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the desire to belong matters deeply, but the fear of the worst-case scenario is holding you back. What if, for just a tiny moment, you could notice that "I matter" – that you value being with these people – *while* the "what-ifs" are still there? Not to stop them, but to see what might be possible when you let that mattering stay, even when the fear shows up.

Patient: I do want to matter, to sit there and actually feel like I belong. But if I try to hold that alongside the what‑ifs, the fortune‑teller just cranks them up — I definitely trip or say something stupid, they laugh, the invites stop — so it all feels impossible; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to hold the mattering alongside the what-ifs feels like fueling the disaster story – like you're trying to keep the fire going. What if, instead of trying to hold it, you could *ask yourself what matters most* when the what-ifs show up – not while they're showing up, but *after* they're gone?

Patient: If the what‑ifs ever quieted, what would matter most is whether I'm still included — whether the invites keep coming and I don't end up alone. But my fortune‑teller voice says that's impossible: by then they'll have already stopped inviting me and I'm back to being excluded, so asking that feels pointless. I'm running low on energy — can we slow down? I don't know how to imagine an "after" when my mind insists the chain is already set.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of not being included matters deeply, but the "what-ifs" are making it impossible to imagine an "after" – like you're trapped in the story. What if, instead of trying to imagine an "after," you could *notice what it's like to let go of needing to imagine it* – just for a tiny moment?

Patient: Honestly, "letting go" feels like turning off the safeguards — the fortune‑teller just takes that as a green light and runs the crash: I trip, blurt something, they laugh, the invites stop. I don't have the energy for another round of that; can we slow down? I don't know where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let go feels like it would mean giving the fortune-teller power to keep running the crash. What if, instead of trying to let go, you could *ask yourself what matters most right now – not about what might happen after the crash, but about what you could do in this moment to take small steps towards feeling included*?

Patient: What matters most right now is not losing the few people I still have. Maybe a small step would be texting one friend something simple like, "I'd like to come, might be a bit quiet," but the moment I picture hitting send I see them rolling their eyes, ignoring me, and that becomes the end of invites — so it feels pointless. I'm getting worn out; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even imagining the small step feels like it's not worth it because of the "what-ifs" about how they might react. What if, instead of trying to imagine the outcome, you could *notice what's happening when you picture yourself not doing the step* – what emotions come up, what thoughts show up, what physical sensations you notice?

Patient: At first there's a tiny, stupid relief picturing not sending the text, like I avoided a mess — but that flips fast: a familiar shame rushes in and my mind already plays the whole disaster (they roll their eyes, stop inviting me, I'm left out). My chest tightens, my hands go numb, my face feels hot, and I get this hollow, resigned sadness. I'm telling myself not to try because the worst outcome feels inevitable — can we slow down? I don't know what to do next.

Therapist: It sounds like the relief of not sending the text is quickly replaced by the familiar shame and the "what-ifs" – and that's making it even harder to move forward. What if, instead of trying to avoid the worst outcome, you could *ask yourself what matters most about feeling that relief – what would it be like to have that tiny, stupid relief stay, even if it's not enough to change the outcome*?

Patient: I guess that tiny relief would feel like a brief shield — my chest loosens for a second and I tell myself I dodged a mess. But it never sticks: shame rushes back and the fortune‑teller turns that relief into proof I'm already written off — they notice I'm quiet, they roll their eyes, the invites stop. I don't see how that little calm could last; I'm drained and getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the relief is just a fleeting shield that gets pushed away by the shame and the fortune-teller's voice. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the relief, you could *notice what happens when the shame shows up* – what would it be like to stay with that feeling for just a moment, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: When I try to stay with the shame it just replays that old failure — my chest clamps, my hands go numb, my thoughts splinter like a crash log and I can't hold a single thread. The shame becomes proof for the fortune‑teller: they'll notice I'm fragile, roll their eyes, stop inviting me, and I'm back to being excluded — it feels inevitable. My attention keeps flickering and I’m getting worn out; can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to stay with the shame is actually making it worse, and the fortune-teller's voice is getting louder. What if, instead of trying to stay with the shame, you could *ask yourself what matters most about not crashing* – what would it be like to find a tiny thread of connection to your own humanity, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Not crashing would mean...maybe just sitting through a few minutes without my head racing, hearing someone say something that actually lands, and feeling a tiny bit human again — like maybe the invites keep coming. But the minute I picture that, the fortune‑teller compiles the bug report: I fumble the thread, they notice my awkwardness, they pity or laugh and the invites stop. My chest tightens just saying that — can we slow down? I don't know how to trust that a little thread won't snap.

Therapist: It sounds like the minute you try to imagine not crashing, the fortune-teller starts compiling the bug report again – and that's making it hard to trust that the thread won't snap. What if, instead of trying to control the thread, you could *notice what it would be like to let the thread snap* – just for a moment – and then see what happens?

Patient: If I let the thread snap my head fills with the whole collapse: I start to cry or fumble, someone notices I'm falling apart, a laugh or an eye-roll follows, and then the invites stop — like a final commit that deletes me. Just picturing that makes my chest clamp, the old shame spikes, and my attention splinters, so I don't see how watching it would prove anything except that the disaster is certain. I'm low on energy — can we slow down? I honestly don't know what that would show or where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like letting the thread snap is actually what you're most afraid of – and that's making it impossible to imagine watching it happen. What if, instead of trying to control what happens when the thread snaps, you could *ask yourself what matters most about being here* – not about what might happen when the thread snaps, but about what you'd be holding onto in this moment if it did snap?

Patient: If it snapped, I'd want to cling to the fact that I showed up — that I tried to be part of things and maybe one friend noticed I cared. But my fortune‑teller immediately turns that into proof I'm fragile: they'll pity or laugh, invites stop, and holding onto it feels pointless. My chest's tight and my attention's fading—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even the thought of holding onto showing up is getting lost in the fortune-teller's voice. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the thought that you showed up, you could *notice what's happening to your chest when that thought comes up* – not about what the fortune-teller would say, but about what's happening in your body when you think about showing up, even if it feels fragile?

Patient: My chest tightens — like a debugger spiking with errors: breathing gets shallow, my hands go numb, and my focus fragments into the same loop — I picture myself showing up, fumbling, them laughing, and the invites stopping for good. I can't hold anything else when that hits; I'm getting worn out — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of showing up is getting stuck in the same old loop – and that's making it impossible to move forward. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the thought that you showed up, you could *ask yourself what's underneath the tightness in your chest* – what's happening to you when that thought comes up, not about what the outcome is, but about what matters most in this moment?

Patient: Underneath the tightness is this cold, prewritten verdict that I'm already failing — like as soon as I try to breathe someone will sniff out my awkwardness, laugh, and the invitations will stop for good. What matters most right now is not losing the few people I have, but my head keeps pinging with that crash report and I can't steady my hands or breath. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of failing is what's really driving the tightness – and that's making it hard to move forward. What if, instead of trying to push the thought away, you could *notice what happens when you try to hold onto it* – like holding a rock in your hand, even though it's heavy and it feels like it's going to slip away?

Patient: It feels like gripping a hot, jagged rock — my hands go numb, shame wells up, and my mind immediately compiles the whole crash: I fumble, someone laughs, the invites stop, and it’s like the rock will slip and smash whatever’s left of me. I’m running low on energy and getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?
