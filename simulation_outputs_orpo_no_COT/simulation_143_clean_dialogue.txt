Patient: I've been stuck feeling like my whole identity is just "data scientist" and I can't see anything beyond that, which feels awful. My brain instantly jumps to the worst — like I'll choke at this new demanding job, mess something up that costs the team, get fired, never recover professionally, and end up isolated and starting over with nothing at my age.

Therapist: When you notice that worst-case thinking showing up, what happens in your body when you're with that story—like when you feel like you're already failing?

Patient: My chest gets tight and my stomach drops, like I'm already tumbling down a hole. My heart races, my hands go clammy, and I start to feel lightheaded — it feels exactly like a panic attack coming on. Then my head fills with that disaster story and I freeze; I can't think straight or speak, and everything narrows to that inevitable chain of failures. I know other outcomes are possible, but in the moment they feel totally unrealistic.

Therapist: Those physical sensations—chest tightness, stomach drop, racing heart—when they show up like that, what might it be like to notice them not as a "attack" but just as physical sensations that matter?

Patient: I’ve tried telling myself to treat it like “just sensations,” but it never sticks — the tightness and the drop feel like proof the disaster’s already happening. Maybe if I actually noticed them, it would be like naming a flashing warning light — “tight chest,” “racing heart” — and trying to breathe through it for a few seconds, but my brain almost always hijacks that and starts spinning the worst-case story. So it mostly feels pointless, like noticing the feelings just confirms the doom is real.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "name" the sensations has been met with the same kind of resistance you've had with the worst-case thinking. What if, instead of trying to stop the worst-case story, you could gently explore what happens when you *do* notice the physical sensations—like the tight chest and racing heart—while still holding onto that value of making progress in your new job?

Patient: I guess I could try, but honestly when I try to name the tightness it just feels like proof the disaster's already underway. My mouth goes dry, I freeze, I miss something important in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, then I'm out and suddenly I'm starting over with nothing at this age—so noticing the sensations feels like the first step down that slope. It feels impossible to hold the value of doing well at the job and the panic at the same time; my brain won't let me.

Therapist: That's a really hard spot to be in. It sounds like the tightness and freeze are already so connected to that worst-case story that it feels like if you notice the sensations, you'll be taken away from the value of doing well at the job. What would it be like if, for just a moment, you could be with the panic while still holding onto the value of making progress in your job? Not to change what's happening, but just to notice that it's possible to be with both—like your chest tightness and the value of doing well are just there, together.

Patient: I can imagine, maybe for a split second, naming the tightness and still wanting to do well, but then my brain screams that's proof I'm already failing: I freeze, miss something crucial in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, and suddenly I'm starting over with nothing at my age. It feels impossible to actually hold the value and the panic together—I’m getting overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to name the tightness and hold the value, that worst-case story kicks in again. What if, instead of trying to hold the two things together, we could try to make room for just one of them, for just a moment?

Patient: I can try to make room for one thing, and the panic feels like the only realistic choice since it's already there—if I name "tight chest, racing heart" and try to breathe, maybe I won't totally lose it. But even when I do that, my brain immediately says it's proof I'm already failing and the whole chain starts (miss the point in a meeting, team blames me, performance plan, fired, career ruined). Making room for the value of doing well feels impossible because the panic always drags me away. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like even when you try to make room for the panic, your brain is still pulling you toward the worst-case story. Would it be possible to notice that when you notice the panic, the value of doing well isn't "gone" or "lost" in that moment?

Patient: Maybe in theory the value isn't gone, but in the moment noticing the panic feels exactly like evidence the failure's already happened — I freeze, miss something, the team blames me, performance plan, fired — so it doesn't feel like the value is still there. I can't really hold that possibility without my brain screaming it's false, and I'm getting really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the panic is feeling like proof that the failure is happening, and that's what's overwhelming you. 

Before we try to "fix" that, can you notice what happens when you *stop* trying to hold onto the value right now?

Patient: If I stop trying to hold the value, I basically give in and the panic takes over — my chest tightens, I go quiet, and the disaster movie runs on autopilot: I miss the point in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, can't bounce back at my age and end up starting over with nothing. There’s this weird, brief numb relief like I don’t have to try, but it’s mostly shame and a hollow feeling like I’ve handed in my career. I’m getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like when you stop trying to hold onto the value, the panic takes over and you feel like you're losing control. That numb relief sounds like it might be a small, fleeting moment, but it's still connected to feeling like you've given up. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the panic or hold onto the value, you could notice what matters to you about holding onto that value?

Patient: What matters is not screwing up so badly that I have to start over — competence, stability, being able to pay bills and not feel like all my years of work were wasted. But my mind — that stupid fortune-telling machine — immediately flips it into the disaster script: I freeze, miss something in a meeting, the team blames me, I’m put on a performance plan, fired, and suddenly I’m starting over with nothing at my age, so it feels pointless to hold the value. I’m getting really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like what matters most to you is feeling competent and stable, and that's what's getting hijacked by your mind's "fortune-telling machine". 

Can you notice what happens when you notice that machine showing up, before you let it flip into the disaster script?

Patient: There's this tiny little pause when I notice the machine — like a click where I think, "oh, that's the fortune-teller again" — but it feels completely fragile. Almost immediately my chest tightens, my thoughts speed up into that disaster narration (miss the meeting, blamed, performance plan, fired...), and the noticing gets swallowed. Sometimes I can hold that pause for a second and tell myself it's just the machine, but my brain screams that's denial. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny pause is actually a small victory, but it's hard to hold onto because your brain is pushing back against it. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto the pause, you could just notice what happens when the pause is gone?

Patient: When the pause disappears it's like someone slams the door shut and my brain goes full disaster narration — my chest clamps, hands go cold, my voice dies, and I immediately see the chain: I miss the point in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, I'm fired, and at my age I can't bounce back. Sometimes there's a weird numb relief, but mostly it's shame and this hollow certainty that everything's ruined. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like when the pause disappears, the shame and certainty kick in, and it feels like everything is falling apart. 

Can you notice what happens to the shame when it shows up, like it's something you can see or touch in your body?

Patient: It feels like a hot, heavy lump sitting on my chest and throat, like someone poured glue into my ribs and my shoulders slump under the weight. When I notice that gluey shame, my chest tightens more, my voice goes thin, and the fortune-teller flicks on—I'm already missing the point in a meeting, everyone's blaming me, performance plan, fired, starting over with nothing. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that shame is really affecting your body, making it hard to breathe and move. 

What if, instead of trying to "fix" the shame or the fortune-teller, you could notice what matters to you right now, in this moment, when the shame shows up?

Patient: What matters is not being exposed as incompetent — keeping my competence and stability so I can pay bills and not have to start over at this point in life. But the shame sits like glue on my chest and the fortune-teller immediately yells that I'm already failing — I'll freeze in a meeting, the team blames me, performance plan, fired — so it all feels pointless. I'm getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like what matters most to you is keeping your competence and stability, but the shame is making it impossible to feel that way. 

Can you notice what happens when you try to hold onto the idea of being competent and stable, even when the shame shows up?

Patient: For a beat I can force myself to stand in the idea of competence — take a breath, try to focus — but it’s fragile. Almost immediately the shame slams down, my chest tightens, and the fortune-teller yells that I’ll freeze in the meeting, miss the point, the team’ll blame me, I’ll be put on a performance plan, fired, and unable to recover at this age, so the steadiness just collapses. I’m getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to something, but the shame is still really powerful. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto the idea of competence while the shame is there, you could try to notice what happens to the shame when you try to stand in the idea of competence?

Patient: When I try to stand in competence the shame gets shoved to the side for like half a second — my chest loosens a tiny bit and I can breathe — but then the fortune-teller immediately flips out and screams it's all pretending. My body tightens, my voice goes thin, and the disaster movie starts again: I freeze in the meeting, miss the point, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, and at my age I can't recover. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is really good at pushing back against the idea of competence. 

What if, instead of trying to push back against the shame, you could try to notice what would be possible for you if you just let the shame be there, without trying to fight it or push it away?

Patient: Maybe if I just let the shame sit there I could do small, practical things—take notes, breathe, answer one question—like keep my competence together in tiny steps. But my stupid fortune-telling brain instantly screams that's a lie: the shame will swallow me, I'll freeze in the meeting, miss the point, the team blames me, performance plan, fired, and I'm back to square one with nothing. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is really good at telling you that's not possible. 

What if, instead of trying to prove that small, practical things are a lie, you could notice what would happen to the shame if you just did those small things anyway?

Patient: Maybe if I did those tiny things the shame would loosen a little — like the glue thins to a sticky film and I can breathe and answer one question, take a note, keep things moving. But my fortune-teller immediately screams that's just a trick: that tiny looseness will fool me, I'll freeze afterward, miss the real point, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, and then I'm ruined at my age. I know that sounds bleak, but I can't make the other outcome feel real. I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to the edge of feeling like that's all there is. 

What if, instead of trying to make the fortune-teller's scream feel real, you could notice what matters to you right now, in this moment, when the shame is showing up?

Patient: What matters right now is not being exposed as incompetent — keeping my job, my stability, and being able to pay the bills so I don't have to start over at this age. But the shame sticks like glue and my fortune-teller brain immediately screams I'm already failing: I'll freeze in a meeting, miss the point, the team blames me, I'll get a performance plan, then fired, and I won't recover. I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to what matters most to you. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto that job and stability, you could notice what would be possible for you right now, even if you were to let go of that one thing?

Patient: Maybe letting go could free up space to explore other interests or just stop the constant panic, but my brain immediately jumps to the worst: no job, can't pay the mortgage, savings gone, my partner leaves, nobody hires someone my age, I'm isolated and ruined professionally. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't make the other outcome feel real — I'm getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with this idea of letting go. 

What if, instead of trying to make the worst-case outcome feel real, you could notice what matters to you about holding onto that job and stability, even if it means living with some fear?

Patient: What matters about holding onto the job is that it proves I'm competent, keeps the bills paid, and stops my whole life from feeling wasted — it's basically my safety net. But the moment I let that matter in, the fortune-teller fires up and says one mistake will get me blamed, put on a performance plan, fired, unable to recover at my age, lose my savings and my partner — it's a total collapse. I know that sounds extreme but I can't seem to make any other outcome feel real, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like holding onto that job is tied to feeling safe and worthy. 

What if, instead of trying to prove your worth to the job, you could notice what would be possible for you right now, even if you weren't proving that worth to the job?

Patient: Maybe in theory letting go could free me up to breathe, explore other interests, or stop constantly proving myself, but my brain immediately runs the disaster tape: as soon as I'm not proving my worth they'll see me as expendable, I'll mess up, get put on a performance plan, fired, drain my savings, my partner leaves, nobody hires someone my age, and I'm ruined. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't make the other outcome feel real, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like letting go is tied to feeling like you're not worth anything without the job. 

Can you notice what matters to you about being worth something, even if that's not tied to the job?

Patient: I guess what matters is feeling seen and useful outside of work — being kind, curious, and having a life that isn’t just about billing hours or proving myself. But my stupid fortune-teller immediately screams that if I'm not tied to the job nobody will care, my partner will leave, I'll end up alone and worthless and all those years were wasted. I know that sounds bleak but I can't make the other outcome feel real, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to imagine a life where you're not defined by your job. 

What if, instead of trying to make the fortune-teller's scream feel real, you could notice what it would be like to imagine yourself being kind, curious, and having a life that matters to you, even if that life wasn't tied to the job?

Patient: I can kind of picture being curious and kind and having a life that matters outside work — it feels almost peaceful to imagine. But my brain immediately screams that's a fantasy: if I stop proving myself they'll see me as disposable, I'll screw up, lose the job, drain savings, my partner leaves, nobody will hire someone my age, and I'll be completely ruined. I know that sounds extreme but I can't make the other outcome feel real, and I'm getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really caught between the desire for that peaceful imagining and the fear of losing what matters to you. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the fantasy from happening, you could notice what it would be like to hold both the desire for that peaceful life AND the fear of losing the job, right where they are?

Patient: I can hold both for a beat — I actually get this tiny, quiet picture of being curious and kind and having a life that isn't just work, and my chest loosens a little. But right away the fortune-teller screams that imagining that life is the thing that makes me fail: I get complacent, miss something in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, savings gone, my partner leaves, nobody hires someone my age. It's exhausting and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny quiet picture was fleeting, and the fortune-teller's scream came back in. 

Can you notice what happens when you try to hold onto that quiet picture for just a little longer, even if the fortune-teller starts to scream again?

Patient: I can hold it a little longer—maybe a few seconds— and there’s this tiny looseness in my chest where I can actually picture reading a book or going for a walk without my whole identity depending on work. But then the fortune-teller roars back louder than before: I get complacent, miss a critical point, freeze in the meeting, the team blames me, I get a performance plan, then fired, savings gone, my partner leaves, nobody hires someone my age. My hands go clammy, my breathing skids, and I feel that hollow collapse again. I’m getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto that quiet picture, but the fortune-teller's roar is getting louder. 

What if, instead of trying to fight the roar, you could notice what it would be like to *lean into* that quiet picture, even when the roar is there?

Patient: If I actually try to lean into it, there's this small, real ease — my chest loosens and I can picture going for a walk or reading instead of obsessing about work. But my fortune-teller instantly screams that leaning in equals complacency: I'll miss something in a meeting, the team blames me, I'm put on a performance plan, fired, savings gone, my partner leaves, nobody hires someone my age — and my body freezes up. It helps a little for a second, then the panic buries it again, and I'm getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down?
