Patient: Lately I've been feeling stuck and directionless—like my whole sense of self is just tied to running my business. With the kids gone and the PTSD stuff, it's been harder to know what matters to me beyond that. I don't know, it's uncomfortable to talk about and I guess I keep avoiding it.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that feeling of being stuck and directionless, what matters most to you—like what matters to you beyond your business—gets pushed aside.

Patient: I guess that's right. I don't know, it just feels safer to bury myself in the business than face the rest of it, and when I'm not working I kind of panic. Can we not go too deep into the PTSD stuff yet? I'm not great at that.

Therapist: It makes sense that bringing up the PTSD feels overwhelming right now. When that panic shows up when you're not working, what matters most to you about your business—and what's at risk if you stop showing up to it—feels connected to your sense of safety.

Patient: I guess that's true. My business feels like the only thing that keeps me steady, and if I stopped showing up I'm... I don't know, kind of terrified. Can we slow down a bit? I'm not ready to dive into the PTSD stuff yet.

Therapist: It sounds like your business is a lifeline for you right now, and stopping it feels like losing that sense of stability. What if, instead of trying to push away the feeling of panic, you could notice it showing up when you're not working?

Patient: I guess when I try to notice it my chest gets tight and I start doing something—scrolling, cleaning, anything to avoid it. I don't know how to sit with that without freaking out. Can we keep it simple—like one tiny thing I can try when the panic shows up?

Therapist: When that tightness in your chest shows up, what's one small thing you could do with it—just one tiny thing—that doesn't make it go away, but might let you notice it a little more clearly?

Patient: I guess one tiny thing could be putting my hand on my chest and taking three slow breaths, just noticing where the tightness is. I don't know if it'll help, but maybe it won't make me freak out as much as trying to sit with everything. Can we... keep it simple?

Therapist: When you notice that tightness in your chest and put your hand there, what happens to the urge to scroll or clean?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it helps a little, like the urge to scroll softens instead of hitting me full force, but it doesn't disappear. My brain still nags me to do something, and saying it out loud makes me feel kind of exposed and overwhelmed, so can we go slow?

Therapist: Your hand on your chest and those slow breaths might not stop the nagging, but they can help make room for it. When the thought shows up, "I should do something," what would it be like to say it to yourself without doing it?

Patient: I don't know — if I said "I should do something" to myself and didn't do it, it'd feel kind of exposed, like the urge is still there but I'm not giving in. I guess it might let the panic sit next to me instead of taking over, but saying it out loud makes me feel vulnerable. Can we slow down? I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.

Therapist: When you notice that thought, "I should do something," and it feels like giving in would be exposing, what would happen if you just let it be there for a moment—just for one second—without doing anything?

Patient: I don't know — if I let it be for one second maybe the urge eases a little, but it also feels like I'm not doing the thing that keeps me safe and that makes me anxious. I guess it would feel... exposed, like my chest gets tighter. Can we keep this really small? I'm already feeling a bit shaky.

Therapist: Let's try just one tiny step. What would it take for you to notice that thought, "I should do something," for just one more breath?

Patient: I guess... I could try putting my hand on my chest and taking one slow breath, just noticing "I should do something" without doing anything. I don't know if I can hold it longer—it's hard—but I'll try for that one breath.

Therapist: Take that one breath.

Patient: Okay... I tried the one slow breath, hand on my chest. The urge softened a little but the tightness is still there, and I don't really follow how that helps—it just feels unclear and kind of draining. I don't know, I guess I need more time or something.

Therapist: It sounds like that moment of trying it—just for one breath—felt a bit disconnected from what matters to you. What's holding onto that feeling of being stuck, and what might be important to you if you could explore it a little more?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what's holding me is this fear that without the business I'm nothing, like my value's all wrapped up in it. Maybe stuff like creativity or closer relationships would matter, but I'm not sure if that's real or just an idea I like. I'm not sure I follow how digging into that stops the panic, and my head's kind of… running out of steam, so can we go really slow?

Therapist: It makes sense that the business feels like your value, and that's a big weight to carry. What would it mean to you to explore what matters beyond that feeling of being "nothing" when your business isn't there?

Patient: I don't know—maybe it would mean letting myself care about things that aren't tied to money or status, like making stuff or repairing some relationships. My mind's all over the place though, and I keep circling to what would fall apart if I shifted focus, so it feels really risky. I guess we can keep this tiny and slow?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing what matters to you in that quiet moment, even if it feels hard to hold onto. What's one tiny thing you care about, like making something or fixing a relationship, that matters to you even if it feels risky?

Patient: I don't know—maybe making one small thing, like sketching or painting for ten minutes. I guess creating feels less risky than trying to fix a relationship, and that might matter to me. I'm kind of scattered and overwhelmed though, so can we just stick with that tiny making thing for now?

Therapist: Let's just start with that tiny making thing. When you think about sketching or painting for ten minutes, what's one small step you could take right now to make that happen?

Patient: I guess I could just grab my sketchbook and a pencil and set a ten‑minute timer. I don't know if I'll make anything good, but maybe just starting is enough. Can we keep it really small—I'll try that now and tell you if I can stick with it?

Therapist: That's a small enough step. When you set that timer and pick up your pencil, what will you notice when you try to sit with it for just ten minutes?

Patient: I guess I'll notice my hands feel kind of awkward and my chest gets tight, and my brain will ping me to do something else. I don't know if I'll make anything useful—probably just messy sketches or half-finished lines. I'm kind of shaky about even starting, so can we keep it really tiny?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing what matters most to you in that tiny making thing: just starting. What if, instead of focusing on making something "useful," you could just notice what happens when you pick up that pencil and set the timer for ten minutes?

Patient: I guess if I actually pick up the pencil and set the timer I'll notice my hands are awkward, my chest gets tight, and maybe a tiny bit of relief when I focus on the page. I don't know how watching that is supposed to help—how's noticing different from just feeling anxious? But... I can try it now and check in after a few minutes.

Therapist: Noticing your hands, chest, and the relief when focusing on the page is about paying attention to what's happening, not about changing it. It's like taking a step back from the anxiety to see what's underneath it.

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try. I'll pick up the pencil and try to notice without fixing anything, but I don't really know what to look for and my chest's tight and my thoughts keep jumping — can you stay with me while I do this for ten minutes?

Therapist: I'll be here with you, not trying to fix anything or tell you what to do. When you pick up the pencil, I'll just be noticing you and what's happening in that moment.

Patient: Okay... I picked up the pencil and set the timer. My hand feels awkward, my chest's tight, and my thoughts keep pinging, but I made a few messy lines. It's kind of calming and also feels exposing, I don't know. Can you stay with me while I try to keep going for a few more minutes?

Therapist: You're noticing the lines, the feeling of the pencil, and the tightness in your chest, all while keeping the timer going. What's the smallest thing you could do with that messy line right now?

Patient: I don't know — maybe the smallest thing is just to make one more tiny mark or darken a line, not try to fix it. I guess I could add a little shadow or a dot and leave it. Can you stay with me while I try that?

Therapist: That's a tiny step. What happens when you add that shadow or dot, and then stop?

Patient: I added the dot and stopped. It felt weirdly small but a tiny relief—my chest loosened a notch and I could take a slightly deeper breath. I don't know if it means anything long-term, but it didn't make me spiral, so maybe that's something. Can we... keep going? I don't want to jump into anything big yet.

Therapist: That small relief matters. It's not about what it means long-term, but about what happens in this moment. What's one tiny thing you could make or draw next, without trying to fix it or make it "good"?

Patient: I don't know... maybe just one simple curved line or a little shaded corner—something I really can't mess up. I guess I'll try a small circle and shade it lightly; my chest's tight and my hand's shaky, so can you stay with me while I do that?

Therapist: That's a tiny, gentle gesture. What happens when you make that small circle and shade it lightly?

Patient: I made the circle and shaded it — at first my chest tightened, then it eased a little, like a tiny bit of calm. I don't know if it means anything, but it felt less exposing than before. I guess I can try one more small mark, but I don't know how long I can keep this up, can you stay with me?

Therapist: That small circle and shading seemed to create a tiny space for calm. What if, just for one more minute, you could keep making those tiny marks, not because you're trying to fix anything, but because that tiny calm matters to you?

Patient: Okay... I can try one more minute. My hand's shaky and my chest is tight, and I don't know if this will do anything long-term, but it already feels a little less bad with you here—can you stay with me while I keep making tiny marks?

Therapist: It's okay if it doesn't do anything long-term. Just for this one minute, what matters is that you're making those tiny marks, even though your hand is shaky and your chest is tight. I'll stay with you, right here, while you keep going.

Patient: Okay... I'm still making tiny marks—one slow breath, then another. My chest's a bit looser but my thoughts keep pinging and I don't know if I can do much more than another minute. Can you just stay with me and not push me to explain anything right now?

Therapist: *I'm here, quietly, with you, making space for that one more minute.*

Patient: Okay... the minute's up. My chest's a bit looser and my hand steadied a little, but I'm wiped and kind of fuzzy. I don't really want to dig into why it helped—I'm not ready—so can you just stay with me for a few more breaths? I don't know if I can do much more than that.

Therapist: *I'm here, quietly, with you, in the silence.*

Patient: I'm... still wiped and fuzzy. I don't really want to dig into why it helped—I'm not ready, I guess. Can we just sit here for a few more breaths together? I'm not sure what to say beyond that.
