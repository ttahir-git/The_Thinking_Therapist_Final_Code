Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of worrying about my performance at work — obsessing over code quality, reviews, and the possible ramifications of 'failing' on a task. That anticipatory anxiety tends to catalyze procrastination: I over-plan, optimize, and research as an avoidance strategy that feels tied into my PTSD and the isolation I live with. I tend to intellectualize all of this instead of naming the fear outright, so I'm here to try and unpack that without turning it into another 'task.'

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that loop of worrying, what happens just before you start procrastinating – the moment the anxiety kicks in – is that you feel a little disconnected from what matters most to you.

Patient: Yeah, that hits close. I think of it as a predictive-mismatch — my brain forecasts harsh evaluations, so I emotionally detach from my core goals to minimize perceived threat, which then gets externalized as overplanning and research as safety behaviors. I can describe that pattern in detail, but actually naming the underlying fear or sadness feels slippery and kind of embarrassing.

Therapist: It sounds like that "predictive-mismatch" makes sense as a way to explain how your anxiety shows up – especially when it feels tied to your PTSD and isolation.

Patient: Yeah, that lands. I can map it pretty cleanly as a predictive-mismatch—my brain simulates catastrophic evaluations, so I detach as a protective heuristic and then channel energy into overplanning and research. I notice I'm doing that verbal modeling instead of saying "I'm scared" or "I'm lonely," which feels raw and embarassing, so I default to theory. I want to try actually naming the fear, but I don't know how to access it without turning it into another task.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to name the fear, you notice it feels connected to being "raw" and "embarrassing." Would you be willing to try something small – just a tiny step – with that feeling of discomfort, to see what might happen if you didn't try to protect it or turn it into "theory"?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try a tiny step. Right now, when I even consider saying “I’m scared,” I notice a tightness in my chest and a slight nausea in my gut; it feels exposing and a little humiliating to put into words. I can try sitting with that sensation for 30 seconds if you want—I'm skeptical that'll feel useful, but I'm willing to see what happens.

Therapist: Would you be willing to notice that tightness in your chest and nausea right now, not because of what it means or what you're trying to avoid, but just because it's there?

Patient: Okay — I'm noticing a tight band across my chest, like pressure behind the sternum, maybe a 5/10, and a low queasy hum in my gut. My brain immediately wants to label it as another predictive-mismatch and start strategizing, which pulls me out of the raw feeling and into analysis; sitting with the sensation feels uncomfortable and slightly shameful. I'll try to stay with it for a bit and notice if it shifts or if the commentary just keeps taking over.

Therapist: It sounds like the sensation of that tight band and queasy hum is showing up right now – not as a "mismatch" or a problem to solve, but just as it is. When you notice that your brain wants to label it as another predictive-mismatch, what happens if you just let that thought be there, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I let that thought just be, it kind of stays as a background narrator — the label doesn't vanish, but the somatic stuff shifts: the tightness drops from about a 5 to a 3 and the nausea becomes more of a dull hum. My brain immediately generates a meta-theory — like "oh, habituation is happening" — which yanks me back into analysis and away from the felt experience. It's awkward and mildly humiliating to notice that a couple of breaths can change it, and I'm suspicious I'll just convert this into another controlled experiment. I can keep sitting with it for a bit, but I'm not sure how to do that without the commentary hijacking it.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the tightness dropping and the nausea becoming a hum, your brain tries to make sense of that shift by creating a meta-theory about habituation. What if, instead of trying to make sense of it or change it, you simply noticed that "meta-theory" showing up – without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: Yeah — I can hear that little narrator: "habituation," "coping mechanism," etc. If I name it as just another mental event it actually thins out — the tightness drops a notch — but then I'm embarrassed because my brain immediately wants to catalog that as another technique to optimize, and I worry I'll just proceduralize the noticing into another avoidance. I can keep tracking the narrator and the body sensations together, though; it feels awkward but maybe useful.

Therapist: It sounds like when you name the narrator as just another mental event, the tightness does drop – but then your brain starts to worry about "optimizing" that noticing, which feels like a familiar pattern. What if, instead of trying to change it or optimize it, you just kept noticing the narrator and the sensations together, without trying to fix or control them?

Patient: Okay — I'll try noticing both the narrator and the sensations together without trying to fix anything. The internal narrator's still whispering optimization heuristics, but it's quieter; the chest pressure eases a bit and there's a faint warmth that I register as embarrassment more than raw fear. I'm aware I'm still describing it instead of sinking into it, and that awareness itself feels like another thing to manage, but I can stay with this for a little while and see what shifts.

Therapist: It sounds like you're able to notice the narrator's whispering optimization ideas without letting it take over – and that's allowing you to stay with the sensations for a bit longer. What happens if, instead of trying to manage that awareness itself, you just noticed it as "awareness" – without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I notice the awareness itself as a sort of neutral lens, and when I do that the narrator quiets and the chest pressure eases to about a 2/10. There’s still a reflex to turn that noticing into a repeatable strategy — which feels exactly like the avoidance pattern I’m trying to not use — and that makes me mildly ashamed. I can keep sitting with this, though I’m skeptical I won’t end up proceduralizing it into another thing to optimize.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the awareness as a neutral lens has helped you stay with the sensations for a bit longer – and that's still not enough to let go of the reflex to turn it into a strategy. What if, instead of fighting that reflex, you just noticed it as "that reflex" – without judgment or trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — when I call it "that reflex" the narrator's volume drops and the chest eases to about a 1–2, so it helps in the moment. Naturally my brain immediately wants to file that as another technique to deploy later, which makes me feel a bit ashamed and performative. I can keep sitting with it, but I'm not sure how to avoid proceduralizing this — what would you suggest we try next so I don't just turn it into another checklist?

Therapist: It sounds like even when you notice the reflex as "that reflex", your brain is still trying to use it as a tool. What if, instead of trying to "avoid" proceduralizing it, you tried to notice what would happen *when* you did turn it into a checklist – not while you're trying to avoid it, but while you're noticing it happening anyway?

Patient: Okay — if I let myself proceduralize, I immediately start enumerating steps: observe chest tightness, name the narrator, reframe it as "that reflex," take a few measured breaths, and mentally file it as "strategy A" for future deployment. That checklist produces an illusion of mastery — the somatic intensity dips a notch, but there's this performative shame and a sense that I'm buffering myself from the underlying fear rather than engaging with it. Noticing that double-state feels both relieving and corrosive; what would you suggest I try in the moment when I'm simultaneously calming down and also shutting down emotionally?

Therapist: It sounds like the checklist creates a temporary sense of control, but at the cost of shutting down emotionally. What if, in that moment when you notice the checklist happening, you tried to notice what's left when the checklist is gone – not what you're doing to calm down, but what's left of the fear or anxiety *after* you stop trying to manage it?

Patient: I'm suddenly more jittery and my focus keeps snapping away, which makes staying with this really hard right now. When the checklist falls away what's left is a hollow, low-grade dread — a tightness in my chest and this thin running commentary that I'm going to fail or be found out. My brain already wants to label that as a "threat to self-efficacy" and turn it into data, which feels protective and kind of cowardly; I can try to sit with the knot, but I'm worried I'll just proceduralize it — what would you suggest I do right now so I don't just make it another checklist?

Therapist: It sounds like the checklist is not just about managing the symptoms, but also about avoiding the underlying feeling of dread. What if, in this moment, you tried to notice the knot in your chest as it is – not as a "threat to self-efficacy" or a "fear of failure", but simply as a sensation that is present? Not to change it, but just to notice it – without judgment, without trying to push it away or make sense of it.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to notice it. There's a knotted pressure right under my sternum, like a fist tightened in my chest, my breaths are shallow, and there's a jittery flutter in my gut — maybe a 6/10 in intensity. My mind immediately wants to label it as a "threat to competence" and proceduralize the noticing, and when I catch that labeling it softens a bit, but then my attention keeps snapping away and I feel embarrassed that I'm already turning this into another tactic. Can you guide me through staying with it for a minute without making it a checklist?

Therapist: Notice the sensation of the knotted pressure *without* trying to label it as a "threat to competence". Just notice it: the tightness under your sternum, the shallow breaths, the flutter in your gut. When your mind tries to label it, notice that thought like a cloud passing by – "threat to competence" – and gently *let* it go. Don't try to push it away or change it, just let it be there while you keep noticing the physical sensations.

Patient: Okay — I'm trying. There's a tight knot under my sternum, breaths are shallow, and a jittery flutter in my gut, maybe a 6/10. I notice the thought "threat to competence" rise like a cloud, I let it drift, and that actually softens the knot to about a 4, but my attention keeps snagging on task-related worries and I feel kind of embarrassed that I'm proceduralizing the whole thing. Can you help me stay anchored with the sensation without turning it into another checklist?

Therapist: Notice the knot *while* you notice the thought "threat to competence". When the thought rises, don't try to push it away or change it. Just notice it as you notice the knot – the tightness under your sternum, the shallow breaths, the flutter in your gut. What happens when you focus on the knot, not on the thought?

Patient: When I focus on the knot instead of the thought, the cognitive chatter actually decouples a bit — the "threat to competence" mantra slides back and the somatic signal sharpens: a concentrated pressure under my sternum, breathiness, and a metallic loop of worry in my throat. That clarity is oddly exposing — it makes me feel more vulnerable, which my brain hates, so it immediately starts theorizing about why it's happening and trying to turn it into a reproducible tactic. I can keep holding it for a bit, but I'm already scheming about steps to make this sustainable — what would you suggest to help me stay with the sensation without proceduralizing it?

Therapist: Notice the *exposure* of the vulnerability – that feeling of being more open to pain and discomfort. What happens when you *don't* try to make sense of it, or turn it into a tactic? When you just notice the metallic loop in your throat, the breathlessness, and the pressure under your sternum – what's the relationship between that feeling and your desire to change it?

Patient: It feels like the exposure flips a switch — the urge to change becomes an emergency response: a meta-regulatory move to reduce unpredictability and protect my sense of competence, so I immediately start hunting for tactics. That insight brings this hot, familiar shame — it’s frustrating and kind of humiliating, and it just makes me want to fix it instead of feel it. I can try to sit with that, but I'm anxious and keep scheming on how to proceduralize this; how do we keep from turning it into another checklist right now?

Therapist: The shame is what's driving the urge to change – to avoid feeling vulnerable and incompetent. Notice how the shame *isn't* about being incompetent – it's about the emotional discomfort of being seen as vulnerable. When you notice that, what happens to the urge to change?

Patient: It kind of dulls the urgency — seeing it as shame about being seen reframes the impulse from "fix the task" to "protect myself," so that initial panic eases. But the change reflex doesn't go away; it just becomes a quieter, more habitual perfectionism that keeps me occupied. I'm feeling pretty drained by the loop and it's getting harder to stay curious instead of scheming. Can you help me stay with the shame itself for a minute without turning it into a technique?

Therapist: Notice the shame *without* trying to make sense of it. Just notice it as it is – the sensation in your body, the thought, the emotional tone. When you try to "fix" it, what happens? The loop just loops back up. What if you just let the shame be there, without trying to change it, for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay — one breath. There's a hot, collapsing feeling under my sternum and this small, sharp voice that says "hide" and "fix it," and when I just breathe into it for that beat the urgency dulls to about a 3/10. I'm pretty spent and it's hard to stay curious instead of scheming, but I can try to keep sitting with it if you want to guide me.

Therapist: Notice that when you breathed into the shame for that beat, the urgency didn't disappear completely – it just shifted to a 3/10. That's okay. What matters is that you're sitting with it, even when it's hard. What would it take for you to stay with that 3/10, not for a minute, but for just a tiny bit longer?

Patient: Practically, I think what would help is a time-boxed micro-task: I'll stay with that 3/10 for 30 seconds and on each exhale name the most obvious sensation — "pressure," "heat," "shame" — and if the scheming starts I'll just note "there's the schemer" and come back to the body. I'm skeptical this won't become another tactic, but I'm willing to try it; I'm pretty drained, so keep instructions minimal.

Therapist: That sounds like a tiny, manageable step. When you notice the 30 seconds are up, what happens?

Patient: When the 30 seconds end the knot does loosen—maybe down to a 2/10—and there's this small, airy gap where the panic was, which feels strangely peaceful and exposed at the same time. Almost immediately the schemer saunters back in with the checklist impulse, which brings a performative shame and makes me worry I'm just inventing another tool to avoid the real thing. I'm pretty drained by this loop—can we do another tiny step you guide me through that keeps instructions minimal so I don't just proceduralize it?

Therapist: When you notice the schemer coming back in, what happens *before* you try to push it away?

Patient: There’s a half-second freeze — my attention narrows, chest tightens, and a rapid internal audit starts: enumerate risks, simulate failures, draft countermeasures. That audit is what I call the schemer; it’s basically an automatic cost‑benefit calculation that almost always wins because it feels safer than feeling the vulnerability. Right before I try to push it away there’s this hinge-moment where either I proceduralize or I stay with the sensation, and honestly I usually default to proceduralizing because it feels like competence. I’m pretty spent — can you help me stay on that hinge without letting it flip into another checklist?

Therapist: What happens *just before* you decide to "push it away" – like the moment the schemer is about to win – what's the smallest thing you could do to let the freeze be there *with* the vulnerability, without trying to change it?

Patient: Right before I push it away there's a micro‑freeze — attention narrows, chest tenses, and the schemer starts queuing up a remedy list. The smallest thing that feels possible is one slow exhale and silently label the moment "freeze" and "vulnerability" (hold for three counts) — no action plan, no fixing, just letting the sensations coexist. I'm jittery and pretty drained, so that minimal anchor feels doable, even though part of me is already suspicious I'll turn it into another tactic.

Therapist: That's a tiny, tiny step. When you label it "freeze" and "vulnerability" and hold for three counts, what happens to the schemer's queuing up of a remedy list?

Patient: It stalls — the remedy list loses momentum and the rapid audit falters, like a gear skipping; the chest eases a couple of points and there's a small, quiet gap. But then my brain almost immediately tries to catalog that pause as "Strategy B," which triggers a prickly shame and a jittery urge to proceduralize again. I'm pretty drained—can you guide one tiny step to help me keep that gap open without my mind filing it away?

Therapist: What if, when you notice the cataloging happening, you don't try to "fix" it – just notice the cataloging itself, like a tiny voice saying "Strategy B" – without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I can try that. I notice the thin whisper of "Strategy B" and when I label it as just that the audit falters and my chest eases a bit, but then this prickly shame floods in like I'm being performative. My attention's jumpy and it's hard to stay, so can you give one very small, concrete anchor—no steps to memorize, just something minimal—to help me keep that gap open?

Therapist: When you notice the prickly shame, what happens *just* before your attention jumps away?

Patient: There's a split-second micro‑freeze — chest tightens, breath shortens, and the internal auditor clicks on with a rapid queue of fixes. That little bodily jolt feels like exposure (a hot, embarrassing spike) and almost immediately triggers the schemer to hijack attention into checklist mode so I can pretend I'm being competent instead of vulnerable.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is being triggered by the bodily sensation of being exposed. What happens if, when that happens, you simply notice the sensation of the chest tightening, without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: When I just notice the chest tightening without trying to change it, my brain actually gaps for a beat and the pressure feels more like a localized hot clamp behind my sternum; the urge to deploy fixes softens, but a sharp, embarrassed shame spikes in its place. I can hold that for a few breaths, though my attention keeps snagging and I feel kind of wiped — can you help me stay with it for one more breath?
