--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early fifties, back at school, and lately I've been wrestling with intense anxiety in social situations — I end up avoiding gatherings with friends even though my partner is really supportive. It's gotten worse since the kids left; the grief and this big life transition feel tangled up with the anxiety. I've tried things before and it doesn't work, so honestly, how is talking about it here supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already feeling really stuck and skeptical about what might help. That makes sense, especially when you've tried things before and they haven't worked out. 

What would it be like for you to hold onto the thought "I've tried before and it didn't work" while we're sitting here together, even if just for a minute? Not as a label on you, but just as a fact about what's happened in the past.

Patient: Okay, I'll try to hold that thought for a minute, but it's uncomfortable — my chest tightens and my mind starts cataloguing every time something I tried fell flat. When I sit with it, I get this urge to defend myself or prove I'm not helpless, because admitting it feels like admitting I'm stuck. How is that supposed to help, really?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you feel that urge to defend yourself, your mind starts to push away from what you're trying to hold onto – that thought about trying before and it not working. 

Notice that the urge to defend yourself shows up right after you try to sit with the thought. What happens when you try to make room for that thought, even if it's still uncomfortable – like when your chest tightens?

Patient: When I try to make room for it my chest really tightens, my breathing gets shallow, and my head starts listing every time something I tried failed — it feels like a rerun of embarrassment and shame. I want to run, check my phone, or find something to fix it so I don't have to sit with that feeling. But honestly, how is sitting with tightness supposed to help when every time I do this I end up panicking or shutting down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for that tightness, it feels like it's getting worse – like the thoughts are getting louder and the physical sensations are getting stronger. 

What if, instead of trying to make room for the tightness, you could notice it as something that shows up when you're trying to avoid that painful feeling of shame and embarrassment? Not because it's "wrong" to feel that way, but because it matters to you that you're feeling stuck and unsure – even if it feels like it's not helping right now.

Patient: Maybe that's right — the tightness is a sign I'm trying to dodge the shame. But I've tried "noticing" before and it just feels like watching a car crash; it doesn't stop my breathing or the urge to leave. How is paying attention to it supposed to actually change what happens when I'm at a dinner or a gathering?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness is just adding to the feeling of being stuck. 

What if, instead of trying to "stop" the tightness or make room for it, you could notice it as just one small part of what's happening when you're at a dinner – like the feeling of your chest when you're listening to someone talk, or the sensation of your feet on the ground? Not because you want to change it, but because it's already there – and it's already showing up even when you don't want it to.

Patient: I hear you, but honestly when I try to treat it like just one part, the chest-tightness hijacks everything — I can't follow conversations or even steady my breathing. I've tried noticing and mindfulness before and it didn't change the actual panic in the moment, so I'm skeptical: how is that supposed to stop me from bolting or freezing at a dinner? I want something that actually changes what happens when it hits, not just a new way to watch it.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing and mindfulness haven't worked as a way to change the panic in the moment – and that's frustrating. 

What if, instead of trying to change the panic, you could think about what matters most to you when you're at a dinner – not the panic itself, but what you value about being with friends and having a good time. Like, "I want to be able to laugh with my friends" or "I want to feel connected to them."

Patient: Sure — I do care about feeling connected and laughing with friends; that's why it hurts that I keep avoiding them. But in the moment the panic isn't a choice — saying "remember your values" feels like a platitude and my legs are already halfway to the door. How is focusing on values supposed to stop my heart from racing or the urge to bolt, and what would that actually look like in a real dinner, step by step?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make a connection between your values and what happens in the moment – but the panic is already happening. 

What if, instead of trying to "stop" the panic, you could ask yourself what would happen if you made room for that feeling of panic – just for a moment – while you're still thinking about what matters to you? Like, "If I let this feeling of panic show up, what would I notice about the dinner – even if I'm still scared?"

Patient: If I let the panic show up, I mostly notice the physical stuff — tight chest, shallow breath, a buzz in my head, and everything going a bit muffled. Every so often I catch a friend's laugh or my partner's hand on my arm, but usually the panic drowns that out and my feet are already moving. So how is noticing that supposed to help me actually stay in the room when my body is screaming to leave — what would make me stick around long enough to even notice those small things? I mean, it feels like asking me to watch a train wreck while it’s happening.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is just adding to the overwhelm – like trying to "watch" the train wreck while it's happening. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the sensations while the panic is still happening, you could ask yourself what would happen to the sensations if you weren't trying to "fix" them – if you just allowed them to be there, without trying to change them? Like, "If I didn't try to make this tight chest go away, what would it be like to just hold it there for a second – even if it's uncomfortable?"

Patient: I've tried "letting it be," and most of the time it just ramps up — my heart pounds harder, my head goes foggy, and I feel trapped. Sometimes if I can stay with it for several minutes it eases, but at a crowded dinner my legs are already halfway to the door before that happens. So honestly, how is asking me to hold it for a second supposed to help when my body's on autopilot and I don't have those minutes?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold the sensations for a second, they just get worse – and that's really tough. 

What if, instead of trying to hold the sensations, you could ask yourself what matters most to you in that moment – not when the panic is gone, but when it's still there. Like, "What would I be missing if I left the dinner right now – not because of the panic, but because of the connection with my friends?"

Patient: I'd miss the small, ordinary stuff — the laugh that actually gets me laughing, a friend who remembers something about the kids, feeling ordinary for a little while since the house emptied. But when the panic starts my body already wants out, so how is reminding myself what I'd miss supposed to stop that instinct in the moment? I've tried the "remember why" thing before and it doesn't keep me from bolting.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like reminding yourself of what you'd miss doesn't help when your body is already moving – and that's really frustrating. 

What if, instead of trying to "stop" the instinct to leave, you could ask yourself what would happen if you just moved one tiny step towards staying – not because the panic goes away, but because that small step feels like what matters most to you in that moment?

Patient: Maybe I could try one tiny step — like staying one minute longer or keeping my hands on the table instead of getting up — but I've done the "just one minute" thing before and my legs are already moving. So how is that actually supposed to slow me down when the panic spikes? If you want me to try, tell me a specific, doable action I can do at a noisy dinner and what to do if it doesn't work, because vague "tiny step" stuff just feels useless.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: I apologize for the vagueness of "tiny step" – I know it can feel unhelpful. 

Here's a specific suggestion: at a noisy dinner, I want you to notice what happens when you reach for your drink – just that one small action. 

If you're worried that your legs will move, notice what happens when you're holding the glass – what sensations do you notice in your hands, your arm, your shoulder? 

If you do reach for your drink and your legs start to move, I want you to notice what's happening when you notice that feeling – without trying to stop it or change it.

Patient: Alright—I can try the glass thing and notice the sensations in my hand and arm, but honestly that feels familiar and usually just makes me more aware while my legs still move. How is focusing on my hand supposed to actually stop my body from bolting? If it doesn't work in that noisy dinner, tell me the next specific action I should do in the moment—right then—because vague suggestions don't help me when panic's already in motion.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Focusing on the sensations in your hand might actually make your legs move faster.

When you notice your legs moving towards the door, I want you to notice where they touch the floor.

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. Right now I notice my heels pressing into the floor, a dull weight under the balls of my feet, and a little numbness around my left ankle. It grounds me for a second, but my legs still want to move — how is noticing that touch supposed to actually stop me from bolting when the panic hits?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Noticing the touch of your heels on the floor is a small step back from the panic. 

When you notice that the numbness around your left ankle is still there even though your legs are moving, I want you to notice what happens when you look down at your feet – not to try to stop the movement, but just to look.

Patient: When I look down I see my toes, the smudge on the floor, my heels pressing in — it does pull me back for a second, but my chest is still tight, my hands are shaking, and my thoughts are already leaping to reasons to leave. That tiny beat helps a hair, but it doesn't stop my legs from moving, and honestly I've done this grounding stuff before and it hasn't kept me. If looking down doesn't hold me, tell me the very next specific thing to do right then — I need a concrete step I can actually do in the moment, not another abstract suggestion.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: The chest tightness and shaking thoughts are still there. 

The next thing I want you to do is reach for the glass of water in front of you – not to drink from it, just to hold it in your hand.

Patient: Okay — I'm reaching for the glass now. My hand is shaking, the glass feels colder than I expect, and holding it pulls my attention there for a breath, but my chest is still tight and my mind is already scripting how to leave. It helps a hair, honestly, but not enough — if holding the glass doesn't stop me from bolting, what exactly do you want me to do next in that same moment?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: The chest tightness and the script about leaving are still there. 

In that moment, I want you to make room for your partner's hand on your arm – not to change the panic, but to notice the physical touch of their hand on yours.

Patient: Their hand is warm and steady on my arm — it eases the tightness for a single breath and that's something — but my chest is still pounding and my thoughts are jittery and scattered, like I just got a jolt. It helps a hair, really, but not enough to stop me from moving; if that touch doesn't hold me, what exactly do you want me to do next in that same moment? How is noticing this supposed to interrupt the automatic urge to bolt?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: The warmth of your partner's hand on your arm is a small anchor. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you lean slightly into their hand, without trying to hold it or change the panic – just to notice what it feels like to be in that space with them.

Patient: I lean into their hand and it steadies me for one breath, but then my heart spikes and my brain instantly starts scripting exits — I feel jittery and distracted. It helps a hair but not enough to stop the urge to bolt. How is leaning into their hand actually supposed to interrupt that automatic shove to leave, and if it doesn't work right then, what's the very next thing I should do in that same moment?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: The spike in your heart and the script about leaving are still there. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you take one small step back from the thought "I need to leave" – just one tiny step – and look at your partner.

Patient: Okay — I try to take that tiny mental step back and look at my partner. Their face is calm and a little worried, and for a breath I feel steadier, but then my chest jolts and my thoughts scatter into a dozen reasons to leave — my legs are already tensing. How is just looking at them supposed to stop that shove to the door, and if it doesn't work right then, tell me the exact next thing to do in that same moment.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: The calmness in your partner's face and the steadiness in your chest are small anchors. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you take a deep breath in together with your partner – just that one breath – and say "I'm here" to them.

Patient: I take the breath with them and force out "I'm here" — my voice comes out thin and shaky, and it pulls me back for a single beat, but my chest is still pounding and my thoughts are scattering all over. Honestly, it barely helps; my legs are already tensing. How is saying that supposed to keep me when my body's already on the move, and if it doesn't work right then, what exactly do you want me to do next in that same moment?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: The "I'm here" feels like a small act of courage. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you stop trying to control the sound of your voice – just for one second – and instead notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor.

Patient: I stop trying to shape my voice and let it be thin, and I look down at my feet — heels pressing into the floor, a little numbness at my left ankle, toes curled a bit — it steadies me for maybe half a breath, then my heart spikes and my thoughts zipping all over again. I'm more on edge than before — my hands are shaky, I'm feeling jangly and distracted, and the urge to get up is loud. Fine, I can notice my feet, but honestly that barely delays the shove to the door — if that doesn't hold me, what's the exact, concrete thing you want me to do next right then (what to do with my hands, legs, voice), because I've done grounding and it usually fails. How is this any different?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: The numbness at your left ankle feels like it's holding for a moment. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you make room for the shaky feeling in your hands – not to try to stop it, but to notice it as you reach for something. Not your partner's hand, not the glass, but something right in front of you.

Patient: Okay—I'm reaching for something in front of me, a napkin, and my hands are trembling so much the napkin scrunches; my fingers feel numb and cold and it only pulls me back for a breath. I'm more jittery and distracted than before — my heart's racing and my thoughts are bouncing around like static. If that doesn't stop me from getting up, tell me exactly what to do with my hands, my legs, and my voice right then — I need a concrete, usable step, because all this "notice" stuff has failed me before.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: The napkin scrunches. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you take the napkin and you unfold it, even though it's trembling – just the action of unfolding it.

Patient: I unfold the napkin—my hands are shaking so it comes out crooked, but it does pull my attention for a single breath. Now I'm suddenly more anxious and distracted; my chest tightens and my thoughts are sprinting again. How is unfolding a napkin supposed to stop my legs from moving? If this doesn't hold me, tell me the exact next thing to do right then—what to do with my hands, my feet, and what to say.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: The napkin unfolding feels like a small action. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you take a small step forward with your right foot – just one tiny step – while keeping your left foot on the floor.

Patient: I take the tiny step — my weight shifts forward, my right heel lifts, the numbness in my left ankle is still there, and for half a breath I feel a hair steadier. But then my chest tightens, my thoughts scramble to reasons to leave, and I'm suddenly more jittery and distracted than before — how is this supposed to stop the automatic shove to bolt? If that doesn't hold me, tell me the exact next thing to do with my hands, my feet, and my voice right then.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: The right foot lifts. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you bring your right hand back to the table, and you look at it – not at the napkin, not at the floor, just at your hand.

Patient: I look at my right hand — veins a bit raised, fingers trembling, palm clammy — and it pulls me back for maybe half a breath, but now I'm more anxious and distracted than before, my chest is tight and my legs are already tensing. Honestly, this feels like another tiny delay that doesn't stop the shove to the door — how is that supposed to help? If looking at my hand doesn't hold me, tell me exactly what to do next in that same moment with my hands, my feet, and my voice.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: The hand trembles. 

In that moment, I want you to make a small choice with your voice – just one tiny word – without trying to control the tremble.

Patient: I force out the word "here" — my voice is thin and trembling, and it buys me maybe half a beat. Now I'm actually more jittery and distracted; my chest's tight, hands shaking, thoughts racing — how is saying one word supposed to stop my legs from moving or this pounding? If that doesn't work right now, tell me exactly what to do next with my hands, my feet, and my voice in that same moment, because vague steps aren't cutting it.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: The word "here" is out. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you let your right foot rest on the floor, without trying to move it – just the sensation of it touching the ground.

Patient: My right foot resting feels like pressure under the ball and my toes curled a bit — it steadies me for a breath, but now I'm suddenly more on edge, my heart's racing, and my thoughts keep scattering to reasons to leave. How is focusing on that supposed to stop the shove to the door when my body's already in motion? If this doesn't hold me, tell me the exact next thing to do right then — with my hands, my feet, and what to say — because I'm getting impatient with vague steps.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: The pressure under the ball. 

In that moment, I want you to notice what happens when you say "I can stay" to yourself – not with conviction, but just as a simple statement – while keeping your right foot on the floor.

Patient: I mutter "I can stay" and it comes out thin — my right foot presses flat, my chest tightens, my hands start to tremble and my thoughts are already sprinting to exits. It's barely a beat of relief, if that, and I feel more on edge than before. How is that supposed to help, and if it doesn't, tell me the exact next thing to do with my hands, my feet, and my voice right then.
