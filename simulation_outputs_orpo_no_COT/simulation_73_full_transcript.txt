--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, lately I've been feeling really overwhelmed — this deep sadness and a kind of motivation slump since my job situation went south. It's bleeding into my relationship; I get distant or irritable and then feel guilty about it. I don't know, I guess I'm just stuck and don't know how to fix it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When you say "I don't know how to fix it," what happens in your body when you notice that thought – like if you imagine trying to push it away or tackle it head-on?

Patient: I don't know—when that thought comes up my chest gets tight and my breathing gets shallow, and there's this knot in my stomach. I guess my hands get a bit shaky and I just want to look at my phone or make a joke to dodge it. It's really uncomfortable to sit with, so I keep wanting to switch the topic.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: So when you're with that knot in your chest and the thought "I don't know how to fix it" shows up, what matters to you most in that moment – not the thought itself, but what's possible for you when it's present – even if it feels really tough.

Patient: I guess what matters most is not pushing my partner away — like being able to stay connected instead of snapping or shutting down. I don't know, I want to feel useful again and not like I'm dragging everyone down. But honestly, it's hard to sit with that without wanting to look at my phone or change the subject.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: Staying connected with your partner when you feel that knot in your chest – that sounds like a really important value for you. What would it be like to notice that knot showing up while you're still choosing to make room for your partner's needs – not to push them away, but to see them anyway?

Patient: I guess it would feel... calmer? Like maybe I could breathe a little and actually listen instead of zoning out. I don't know, though — as soon as that knot hits I start making jokes or scrolling my phone to dodge it, and it's kind of embarrassing to admit.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It's not about making jokes or scrolling – it's about noticing what happens when the knot shows up, and what matters most in that moment. Would you be willing to try one tiny step: when that knot hits, just notice it for 5 seconds – without trying to change it, or push it away, or make a joke – just notice what it feels like?

Patient: Okay, I can try that. I don't know if I can sit with it, but I'll give it five seconds. 

Right now my chest feels tight, like a band, my breathing's shallow, and my stomach's fluttering — my hands want my phone and my brain wants to make a joke. I guess that's what it feels like.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Just noticing that tight band in your chest, the shallow breathing, the fluttering stomach, and the urge to reach for your phone – all those sensations are present, without you needing to do anything about them.

Patient: Okay... I tried that for a few seconds. For a moment the band in my chest felt a little less sharp, but then my brain jumped to "what if I never find work" and I reached for my phone before I even realized. I guess I'm kind of embarrassed about how quickly I dodge it — I don't know what to say next, can we slow down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: When you reach for your phone, what happens if you let that hand just rest there, without trying to change the thought that's showing up – "what if I never find work"?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to just let my hand rest, it trembles and my heart picks up, and that "what if I never find work" thought kind of amplifies into a loop. I start imagining bills and my partner getting fed up, and my brain screams at me to do something—anything—so I reach for my phone. I guess if I actually keep my hand there for a few breaths the urge to escape eases a tiny bit, but it feels really uncomfortable and I almost want to change the subject.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Your hand trembling and the thought looping – that sounds really tough. What matters most in that moment, when you feel like your hand is trembling and your brain is screaming – not to push those thoughts away, but to notice what's possible when you stay with them, even if it feels uncomfortable?

Patient: I guess what matters most is not pushing my partner away — like being able to actually stay present and listen, and maybe feel useful again instead of helpless. I don't know, it's hard to talk about without getting weirdly emotional... can we slow down?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional – that's a sign that what matters to you is showing up. Let's take one more tiny step: when you notice your heart getting heavy, what would it be like to say to your partner, "I'm feeling really overwhelmed right now, but I'm here with you"? Not to fix the problem, but just to be present.

Patient: I guess it would feel... kind of relieving, like maybe less alone, but also really vulnerable. I don't know if I could actually say it — I'd probably blurt a joke first and then mumble, "I'm overwhelmed, but I'm here," and feel stupid. Can we slow down? I'm starting to get a little choked up.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: The feeling of vulnerability and relief – that sounds really important. When you imagine saying those words to your partner, what if, just for a moment, you could let the feeling of vulnerability show up without needing to fix it – not by making a joke, but just by being with it?

Patient: I guess if I let the vulnerability show it'd feel terrifying but maybe a little less lonely. I don't know if I could actually say it without a joke tacking on — I'd probably fumble it and then feel stupid. Can we slow down? I'm getting kind of choked up.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: The feeling of being stuck between needing to be with your partner and not wanting to make a fool of yourself – that sounds really tough.

Patient: I don't know... I guess I'm scared they'll think I'm weak or like I'm just a burden on them. So I crack a joke or switch the subject because it feels safer, and then I feel guilty and worse. Can we slow down? I'm getting really choked up and it's hard to keep going.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying around a weight of what might happen if your partner sees you as weak or a burden – that's a really painful thought. When you notice that thought showing up, what would it be like to hold it in your body for just a moment, without trying to change it – not to prove anything to your partner, but just to notice what's there?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to hold it I get this tight, panicky feeling in my chest and my mind just starts racing. I guess if I stayed with it even a bit I'd maybe see it's not as huge as it feels, but it's really scary, so can we... maybe slow down or talk about something a little lighter for a minute?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is connected to a big, scary feeling in your chest. When you're ready, we can try to come back to that feeling – but first, I want to make sure you're taking care of yourself. Would you be willing to take a few deep breaths with me, and notice how your body feels – not the thought, but just the sensation of the breath moving in and out?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. Breathing in, out — it's a little softer, like the band loosens for a moment, but my mind's still racing and my hands itch for my phone. I don't know, I guess it helps a bit, but can we slow down? I'm feeling pretty worn out and it's hard to keep going fast.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Noticing the band loosening just a bit – that's a small step. When you feel like you're running out of energy, what would it be like to slow down just enough to notice what matters most in this moment – not to fix anything, but just to be with it?

Patient: I guess if I actually slowed down, what matters most is not shutting my partner out — just being here even if I'm a mess. I don't know, my chest still feels heavy and my brain's fuzzy, and it's getting hard to keep going, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: That's a really honest statement – it sounds like you're willing to be here with your partner, even if it feels messy. When you notice that heaviness in your chest, what if you could just lean into it, even for a tiny bit – not to push through it, but just to notice what's there?

Patient: I can try, I guess. When I try to lean into it the tightness just digs in and this stupid image from before pops up and I feel ashamed like I screwed up — then my hands itch for my phone and I just want to escape. I don't really have the energy to go deep right now, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already doing what matters most – showing up for your partner, even when it feels hard. When that image of shame shows up, what if you could notice it without judgment – just as it is – and then ask yourself what it might be trying to protect you from?

Patient: I don't know... when that stupid image shows up I get this hot shame and it feels like it's trying to stop me from getting close because I'm terrified they'll see me as useless or a burden. I guess it's protecting me from getting hurt, but I'm wiped out and don't have the energy to dig into it right now — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like that image is connected to a deep fear of being hurt – and that's really painful. When you notice that image showing up, what would it be like to give it a tiny bit of space – not to change it, but just to notice what's there?

Patient: I don't know... I guess when I try to give it space it just turns into this hot, stupid shame and I feel like I messed up. My chest tightens, my hands itch for my phone, and I really don't have the energy to go much deeper right now — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already feeling really overwhelmed – and that's okay. When you notice that chest tightening and the urge to escape, what if you could just notice it without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to just notice it the tightness gets louder and that stupid shame pops up, like I messed up again, and then my hands itch for my phone. I guess I'm wiped out and it's really hard to stay with it—can we slow down or maybe talk about something a little lighter for a minute?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and shame are getting louder – and that's really tough. I'm so proud of you for showing up with that effort, even when it feels like too much. Would you be willing to take one tiny step towards noticing what's there – just for a second – without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay... I can try that for a second. When I do, my chest tightens, that stupid image sneaks in and I almost grab my phone. I don't know if I can stay longer right now—can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and the image are still really strong – and that's okay. You've already taken a big step by noticing what was there for a second. Would you be willing to just notice it again – not to change it, but just to see what's there – when you're ready?

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try to notice it again. When I do, my chest clamps up and that stupid image pops back and I feel like I messed up, and my hands just itch for my phone. I don't know if I can stay with it long—can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and the image are really hard to shake – and that's okay. You're not trying to push them away or change them, just noticing what's there. What matters most to you right now – not the thoughts or feelings, but what's showing up when you're with them?

Patient: I guess what matters most is not pushing my partner away — just being here even if I'm a mess. I don't know, when I'm with those feelings I shrink down and feel stupid, like I screwed up, and my hands just itch for my phone. Can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you notice those feelings, you're already trying to protect your partner and be present, even if it feels hard. When you notice your hands itching for your phone, what would happen if you just let that hand rest there – not to push anything away, but just to notice what's there?

Patient: I don't know... when I let my hand rest it trembles and my heart picks up, and that stupid image sneaks back and I feel like an idiot. I guess if I keep it there for a few breaths the urge to grab my phone eases a tiny bit, but I'm really wiped out — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like letting your hand rest for a few breaths is a tiny step that makes a small difference. When you notice your heart picking up and the image showing up, what would happen if you just held that feeling – not to change it, but just to notice what's there – for just one more breath?

Patient: Okay... one more breath. When I hold it, the band in my chest gets sharp and this hot shame rushes up, my hands tremble and the phone itch eases a tiny bit — I guess that's something. I don't know if I can go further right now, can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: That's a small victory – noticing the band in your chest and the shame showing up, even if it feels hard. When you're ready, you've already taken a step towards holding it for one more breath. What matters most to you right now – not the thoughts or feelings, but what's showing up when you're with them – even if it feels like too much?

Patient: I guess what's most important is not pushing my partner away — just being able to sit with them without turning everything into my panic. I don't know, my chest's heavy and I'm kind of zoned out; can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: You're not trying to change everything or push through the panic – you're just showing up with your partner, even when it's hard. When you notice yourself zoning out, what would happen if you just brought your attention back to that conversation – not to fix it, but just to notice what's there?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to bring my attention back I kind of feel like my chest tightens and I panic a little because I think I've missed something important, and then I zone out again. I guess if I actually stayed present I'd notice small things my partner says and maybe feel less alone, but my hands itch for my phone and my brain wants to dodge it with a joke. Can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto the connection with your partner while also staying present with your own feelings – that's really brave. When your chest tightens and you panic, what would happen if you just allowed that feeling to be there, even for a tiny moment, while you still tried to listen to your partner?

Patient: I don't know... when that tightness comes I kind of freeze — my chest clamps, that stupid image of screwing up flashes, and I feel useless. I guess if I let it sit for a moment I might actually hear my partner and not panic, but my hands itch for my phone and it feels impossible. Can we slow down a bit? I'm... having trouble keeping up.
