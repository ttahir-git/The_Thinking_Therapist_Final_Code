--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a chef in my early thirties, and lately I've been stuck in these cycles of harsh self-criticism — I obsess over every perceived failure at work or in social situations. I can trace it back to being bullied at school; those old voices still show up and wreck my confidence, especially after a rough breakup. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — I've tried stuff before and it usually feels useless, but I needed to at least try.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Those old voices can be really powerful, can't they? It sounds like they've been holding you back from showing up fully in your kitchen and in your relationships.

What happens when you notice one of those critical thoughts showing up—like, right now, as we're talking about it—you make room for it. Just for a moment, what would it be like to acknowledge that thought, but not have it be the boss of you?

Patient: When it shows up my chest gets tight and I go into overdrive — I start rehearsing what I'll say to cover my tracks or throw myself into work to prove I’m not a screw-up. Trying to “make room” for it feels weird, like if I acknowledge it I’m giving it more power, and honestly I’ve tried that mindfulness stuff before and it just sits there. Maybe if I actually call it out — like, “that thought: you’re a failure” — I can spot it, but then it still clings and I snap back into fix-it mode. How is that supposed to help long-term?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for it, you're trying to tame the beast instead of just noticing it.

What if, instead of "making room" for that thought, you just noticed it when it shows up—like you're saying, "Ah, there it is: 'You're a failure'"—without trying to change it? Not to fix it, not to stop it, just to see it.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — like, “Ah, there it is: ‘you’re a failure’.” But when I do, it still sits in my chest and I go into overdrive trying to fix or prove myself. How is that supposed to help when the thought’s still running the show and I just end up more burned out?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It's like that thought is still in charge, and you're trying to push it away. What if, while you're noticing that thought, you could just let it be there—like a gray cloud in the corner of the room—while you're still doing something else?

Patient: Yeah, I get the image, but in real life — like during service when tickets are stacking — it just doesn't feel doable. If I "let it be" it keeps gnawing at me and I end up overcompensating or snapping at someone. How is that supposed to help long-term? If you’ve got a concrete, 3–5 second move I can actually do while I'm plating or calling a ticket, I’ll try it, but I’m not promising it won’t feel pointless.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like in those moments, it feels like you're being asked to choose between two things: the thought, which is causing you distress, and the work of serving customers. 

What if, for just a second, you could notice the thought "you're a failure" *while* you're plating the dish? Not to stop it, but to see it. And then, what small action could you take with one hand that feels connected to your values—like getting the sauce just right—or even just putting down the knife for a second?

Patient: Alright — I could try one tiny thing: a slow 3-second exhale while I make one deliberate swipe of sauce or set the knife down for a beat before I move on, just to anchor myself to doing the job well. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I’ve got ten tickets and people yelling? I’ve tried breathing and micro-pauses before and it just feels like another thing to fail at — do you really think that’ll stick in the middle of service?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if that tiny thing will even matter when things get chaotic.

What if, instead of trying to make that tiny thing work, you noticed that it might actually be *because* of your values that you're showing up at all—the customers, the food, the kitchen—despite the noise.

Patient: Yeah, cooking and making people feel fed actually matters to me — it's one of the few things that still feels like mine. But that critic twists it into more evidence I'm not good enough, and in the middle of service that value just gets shouted down. How is that supposed to help me in the moment? If you want me to lean on values, give me a two- or three-word cue or a tiny move I can actually do between tickets, otherwise it just feels like talking.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to connect to that value while still doing the work.

What if, just for a second, you could notice that critic saying "You're not good enough" *while* you're taking the ticket, and then you could say to yourself, "I'm here to feed this family"

Patient: Okay, I can try that — but "I'm here to feed this family" feels clunky in the middle of service. Give me two words: "Feed them" or even just "For them." Pair it with a tiny move: press my thumb to my middle finger and do a quick 2-second exhale as I set the plate down. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when tickets are stacking and people are yelling? I keep worrying it’ll just be another thing I forget to do.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that if you "forget" to do that tiny move, it won't be enough.

What if, instead of trying to make that tiny move *because* of the tickets and the yelling, you made it *while* you noticed that yelling *while* you were already holding the plate?

Patient: Okay, layering could be doable — I can try noticing the yelling while I'm holding the plate and do "For them" plus thumb-to-middle-finger and a 2‑second exhale as I set it down. But I'm worried it'll just become another mental checklist I forget or beat myself up over if I miss; I've tried micro-tools before and they vanish under pressure. How do I practice this so it actually becomes automatic during a busy shift, and not something else to fail at?


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how to make it stick so it doesn't feel like another thing to forget or fail at.

What if, instead of trying to make it "automatic", you just showed up to that moment with what you had *already* practiced—that tiny move with "For them" and thumb-to-middle-finger?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? You're saying just show up with the tiny move I've already practiced, but in real service my brain blanks and it feels like another thing I'll forget and beat myself up over. If we're actually doing this, tell me a concrete short drill or cue I can practice so it has any shot of happening under pressure — otherwise it just sounds pointless, but I can try.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to actually make it happen, not just talk about it.

Here's a concrete drill: while you're prepping for service, notice when your mind starts to worry about "forgetting" or "not doing it right" *just for 5 seconds*. As soon as that thought shows up, say to yourself "I'm holding the plate" and *do the tiny move*—thumb to middle finger, 2-second exhale.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — are you saying I should be doing this drill during calm prep, not in the chaos? How is practicing a thumb-press in quiet going to make me do it when tickets are flying and I’m panicking? I've done drills like this before and they just vanish under pressure, so if we're actually doing it tell me exactly how many reps, when, and what to do if I forget and just end up hating myself for it.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that practicing in calm prep won't help when things get chaotic.

Here's what I want to try: we'll practice the drill in a different way. When you're getting ready to start service, I want you to do the tiny move *just as soon as you notice your mind starts to panic*. Not because you think it will make a difference, but because it might. When you notice that panic *before* you start panicking, what happens if you just *do* the tiny move anyway?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you want me to do the move as soon as I notice panic, but half the time I don't notice until I'm already spiraling. How is that supposed to help if the signal comes too late? Give me exact stuff: when exactly do I practice (before service, during the first three tickets?), how many reps, and what do I do if I forget and just end up hating myself for missing it?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: I want to try to help you with that.

Here's what I'm asking you to do:

* When you're getting ready to start service, sit down with me for 2 minutes before you start taking tickets. *That's it*. Not during the first three tickets, but before you even start.
* I want you to notice when your mind starts to panic *while you're sitting there*. Not when you notice it while you're taking tickets, but while you're just sitting.
* When you notice that panic *while you're still sitting*, I want you to *do* the tiny move: thumb to middle finger, 2-second exhale. Not because you think it will fix everything, but because it might.
* If you forget and just end up hating yourself for missing it... what happens if you just acknowledge that *while* you're doing it? *What if* you say to yourself "I forgot" and then *do* the tiny move anyway?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — so you want me to sit for two minutes before service and catch the first bit of panic, then do the thumb-to-middle-finger plus a 2‑second exhale when it shows up. How many times should I repeat that in those two minutes? And what if nothing pops up then — does that mean I wasted it or did it wrong? Also, if I blank during service and start spiraling, saying "I forgot" and doing the move sounds...possible, but how is that actually supposed to stop the yelling and tickets from blowing up?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're still trying to make sense of what I'm asking.

Let's try to break it down:

* I'm not asking you to sit for two minutes to "catch" something. I'm asking you to sit for two minutes to *be present* with your body and your thoughts.
* If nothing shows up during those two minutes, that's okay. It doesn't mean you wasted it or did it wrong. It just means you're not noticing anything right now.
* When you do notice something showing up (noticing panic), I want you to do the tiny move: thumb to middle finger, 2-second exhale. Not because it will stop the yelling or tickets from blowing up, but because it might help you notice what's really going on. *While you're doing the move*, I want you to notice what's still showing up—what's still making you feel anxious or overwhelmed.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — sitting for two minutes to "be present" sounds fine on paper, but how is that supposed to help when the chaos hits? Do I do the thumb-press every time a thought pops up in those two minutes, and how many reps are we talking? If nothing shows up then, does that mean I'm good or I blew it? And honestly, when I'm already spiraling mid-service, saying "I forgot" and doing the move feels unrealistic — I've tried drills like this and I just end up hating myself when I miss them, so how is this any different?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: I want to try to understand what's still not working for you.

Let's take a step back. When you're sitting there, I'm not asking you to do the thumb-press *to stop* the chaos. I'm asking you to do it *to notice* what's still showing up while you're already doing it. Not to change the chaos, but to notice what's making it worse.

In those two minutes, I'm not asking you to do the thumb-press *a lot*. Just one time, when you notice panic showing up. Not every time a thought pops up, but when it's specifically panic. And when it doesn't show up at all? That's okay. You're not "good" or "bad". You're just sitting there.

When it feels unrealistic to do the move while spiraling, what happens if you tried it *while* you're already spiraling? Not to stop the yelling or tickets, but to notice what's making it worse. What if, just for a moment, you said "I forgot" and did the move anyway?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I can say "I forgot" and do the thumb-press mid-spiral, but how is that supposed to help when I'm already yelling inside and about to snap at someone? And practically: when exactly am I supposed to do the two-minute sit — right before every service? How many reps should I practice so it actually becomes a habit, and what do I do if I completely blank and can't even remember to press my thumb, because I don't want this to turn into another thing I beat myself up over.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck.

Let's try to break it down even further:

* When you're yelling inside and about to snap at someone, I'm not asking you to do the thumb-press *to stop* the yelling. I'm asking you to do it *to notice* what's making the yelling worse. Not to change the situation, but to notice what's still making it worse.
* You don't have to do the two-minute sit *before* every service. Just try to do it *when* you notice panic showing up, whether that's right before service or right in the middle of service. It might feel really hard to sit with that feeling while yelling at someone, but that's okay. You're not trying to change the situation, just to notice what's making it worse.

As for practicing the thumb-press, I'm not asking you to do it *a lot*. Just one time, when you notice panic showing up. And when you're feeling really stressed about remembering to do it, what if you just *made the tiny move* anyway? Even if you forgot to do it afterwards?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help when I'm already yelling inside and tickets are stacking? Fine, I'll try the two-minute sit before service and do the thumb-to-middle-finger once when I notice panic, but give me exacts: how many days a week, how many reps in that two minutes, and what exactly do I do if nothing shows up or I completely blank during service? I don't want this to turn into another thing I beat myself up over — if I miss it, do I just say "I forgot" and do it then, or is there a backup cue I can use that's actually realistic in the weeds?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: I want to try to clarify what I'm asking you to do.

**Before service:**

* Try to sit for 2 minutes before service, not every day. Just aim to do it when you can.
* When you notice panic showing up, do the tiny move: thumb to middle finger, 2 seconds.

**During service:**

* If you notice panic showing up while you're already doing service, try to notice what's making it worse. Not to change it, but to notice what's still making it worse.
* If you completely blank and can't even remember to press your thumb, here's what you can do:
	+ Take a deep breath in, and say to yourself "I'm noticing that I'm not doing the tiny move right now. What would it be like to try it anyway?" (even if it's just for 1 second)
	+ If that doesn't feel possible, just acknowledge the feeling: "I'm feeling really stressed right now, and it's hard to remember to do the tiny move."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — this still feels fuzzy. Okay, I'll try the two-minute sit before service, but give me exacts: how many reps in those two minutes? Do I do it every shift for a week, or three times a week — what’s realistic to actually make it stick? If nothing pops up during the sit, is that a pass or do I still do the move anyway? And mid-service, if I’m already spiraling and can't even notice, what's a realistic backup cue I can actually do without thinking, because I'm scared I'll just forget and then beat myself up for failing at this too.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: I want to try to clarify what's realistic for you.

**Before service:**

* Try to sit for 2 minutes before service, not every day. Let's aim for 3 times a week. That's a small, achievable commitment.
* During those 2 minutes, just notice if anything shows up. Don't try to do anything. If nothing shows up, that's okay. You're still sitting there.

**During service:**

* If you're already spiraling and can't notice, here's a backup cue that might help: take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and say "I've got this" to yourself. It's not a big deal if you miss the tiny move; it's about noticing what's making you feel stuck and trying to move forward anyway.

Remember, the goal isn't to "do" the tiny move every time. It's to notice what's showing up when you're feeling stressed, and try to move forward anyway.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — this still feels fuzzy and kinda pointless to me. Three times a week sounds doable on paper, but how many reps in those two minutes? If nothing pops up, do I just sit there or do the move anyway? And when I'm in the weeds and spiraling, do I say "I've got this" out loud or in my head — that feels stupid and I can already hear the critic laughing. How is any of this actually supposed to make the critic shut up when tickets are stacking and I'm exhausted from the breakup and burnout?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

It sounds like what matters most to you is finding a way to stop the critic when it feels like it's going to ruin everything. Not just when you're sitting quietly, but when you're actually serving customers and feeling overwhelmed.

Let's try something small. What if, when you notice the critic showing up, you just made a tiny move towards what matters to you? Not because you think it will make the critic go away, but because it feels like it might help you get through the next minute.

For example, what if, when you notice the critic saying "You're not good enough," you just looked at the ticket in front of you and said "I'm going to fix this plate" – not because you think that will fix everything, but because it feels like it might help you get one step closer to taking care of that customer?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm going to fix this plate" sounds practical and connected to the job, but how is that supposed to help when my hands are full and orders are stacking? Do I say it out loud, or just think it? And what if I forget and then just end up beating myself up more — doesn't that just add another failure to the pile?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

It sounds like what matters most to you is finding a way to stop the critic when it feels like it's going to ruin everything. Not just when you're sitting quietly, but when you're actually serving customers and feeling overwhelmed.

Let's try something small. What if, when you notice the critic showing up, you just noticed it *without* trying to stop it? Not by saying "I'm going to fix this" or "I'm going to shut it down," but just by noticing it as it is.

For example, what if you noticed the critic saying "You're not good enough" while you were holding the plate, and you just looked at the plate *as it was*—not as a failure, not as a success, just as the plate in front of you?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? When I'm holding a plate my chest's already tight and my brain's racing through timing and tickets; "just look at the plate" feels like another thing I won't have time for. I can try glancing and thinking "it's just the plate," but honestly that usually just becomes another reason to beat myself up for not doing it perfectly. If we're actually doing this, give me a concrete two-word cue and tell me whether to say it out loud or in my head, because otherwise it just sounds like more talking that won't stick.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

Let's try a small experiment. When you notice the critic showing up while you're serving, I want you to say to yourself: "I am holding."

Say it out loud. Not to fix the plate, not to calm the critic, just to notice that you're holding the plate.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — say it out loud in the middle of service? How is that supposed to help when things are already chaotic and my chest's tight? If I'm going to try it, tell me exactly when to say it (as I pick the plate up, when I set it down?), whether I whisper it or actually say it out loud, and what I do if I forget and feel like an idiot.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: I want to try to make it concrete.

When you pick up the plate, before you start moving it to the ticket, say to yourself: "I am holding." *whisper it to yourself, not out loud*. It's just a small step to notice that you're holding the plate, not to fix it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — whispering "I am holding" feels weird but I can try it when I pick up the plate. How is that supposed to quiet the critic when I'm already panicking in the weeds? And if I forget, do I just berate myself or is there a realistic backup that doesn't make me feel worse?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

When you pick up the plate, whisper "I am holding" to yourself, and then *just focus on putting the plate down*. Don't worry about the critic or the chaos. Just put the plate down.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — whispering "I am holding" feels weird, but I can try it when I pick up the plate. How is that supposed to quiet the critic when I'm already panicking and tickets are stacking? If I forget, what's a realistic fallback that doesn't turn into another reason to beat myself up? Also, give me a specific practice routine: how many reps, when, so there's any chance this becomes automatic and not just another thing to fail at.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

When you pick up the plate, whisper "I am holding" to yourself, and then *just focus on putting the plate down*. Don't worry about the critic or the chaos. Just put the plate down.

As for forgetting, *it's okay to forget*. If you do, *just take a deep breath* and *put the plate down anyway*. Don't beat yourself up.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — whispering "I am holding" and taking a breath might be fine on paper, but in the weeds it just feels like another checkbox I'll forget and then beat myself up over. I'll try it, but how many reps or shifts do you think it actually takes before this stops feeling like something to fail at? And if I blank mid-service and snap anyway, "don't beat yourself up" isn't a plan — what's a realistic next move in that moment?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

Let's try to make it more concrete.

*For the next 2 weeks*, when you're serving, after you pick up the plate, whisper "I am holding" to yourself for just 1 second. Not to fix anything, not to calm the critic, just to notice that you're holding the plate.

If you forget, *don't beat yourself up*. Instead, *just take a deep breath* and *put the plate down anyway*. If you still snap, *step away from the table* for 30 seconds to collect yourself.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — whispering "I am holding" for a second after every plate for two weeks? How is that supposed to help when I'm mid‑rush and dealing with 60‑ticket chaos? I can't just step away for 30 seconds without someone covering me or a chef yelling — what's a realistic backup if I physically can't leave (a silent hand signal, a one‑count thumb press, something that doesn't look weird)? If I miss it I'll just beat myself up more, so tell me exactly how many shifts/reps you want me to do so it's not fuzzy — I'll try it, but honestly I'm skeptical this will stick.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

Let's try to make it more concrete.

*For the next 2 weeks*, when you're serving, after you pick up the plate, whisper "I am holding" to yourself for just 1 second. Not to fix anything, not to calm the critic, just to notice that you're holding the plate.

If you forget, *don't beat yourself up*. Instead, *do a small, subtle hand gesture*: *touch your thumb to your middle finger for 1 count*. This is a small, discreet cue that might help you remember to notice that you're holding the plate.

I don't want you to do this for 2 weeks; I want you to try it *for the next 5 shifts*. That's a small, manageable commitment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — okay, five shifts sounds more doable than two weeks, but I need specifics so this doesn't become another thing to fail at. Do you mean five actual service shifts (even if some are double shifts), and the whisper + thumb‑touch after every single plate or just after the ones that make me panic? Also, what if my hands are gloved/covered in sauce — touching my thumb to my middle finger looks weird and gross; can I use a throat‑whisper or a quick inward breath as the backup? Finally, how do you want me to track this so it's something concrete we can review next time instead of me just feeling like I messed up?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: I want to try to connect with what's really bothering you.

*For the next 5 shifts*, when you're serving, *whisper "I am holding" to yourself immediately after you pick up the plate*. This means it doesn't matter if you're handling a messy plate or a clean one; just as soon as you've got the plate in your hands, say that phrase to yourself.

*If you forget*, *do a throat-whisper "in" for 1 count* or *take a quick inward breath*. This is a small, subtle cue that might help you remember to notice that you're holding the plate.

*Tracking*: I want you to write down one thing that happened during each of those 5 shifts when you said "I am holding" to yourself. It can be something small, like "I didn't panic when I saw the long line" or "I put the plate down without dropping it". Just write down one thing that happened.

Patient: Alright — fine, I’ll try it for five service shifts, but I’m skeptical this won’t just turn into more stuff to fail at.

Quick clarifying Qs: when you say “shifts” you mean actual service shifts (so a double counts as one), right? I’ll set a phone reminder to write one short line in my Notes within 30 minutes after each shift — something like: “Shift 1: whispered ‘I am holding’ — didn’t panic when 3‑ticket pile came.” If I completely forget, is it okay to just write “I forgot” and move on, or do you want me to try to reconstruct something? 

I’ll do this and bring the five lines next time — even if they end up lame.
