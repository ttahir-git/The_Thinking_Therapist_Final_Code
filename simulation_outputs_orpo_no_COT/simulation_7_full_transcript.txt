--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Since the breakup I've been on edge — I snap at people, get furious over little things, and then beat myself up about it. I'm a construction worker, used to handling tough days, but this anger's different and it's wrecking things for me. Honestly, I'm skeptical this is gonna help — how's talking supposed to fix that?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that anger feels really tied to your sense of control and competence, like it's a sign that you're not handling things like you normally would. When you snap at people or get furious over little things, what's the thought that follows those moments – something like "I'm failing" or "I'm not good enough"?

Patient: Yeah — it's a lot like "I'm not good enough" or "I messed everything up," but there's also this angrier side that thinks "They owe me" or "How could they do that?" I end up ashamed and furious at the same time, then kick myself afterward. But seriously, how's just naming those thoughts supposed to help? I've tried thinking about it before and it doesn't change the blowups.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Those thoughts do seem to fuel the anger and shame. When you notice that "I owe" or "How could they" show up, what's the moment that really matters – what matters when you're in the middle of that blowup, like when you're yelling at your coworker?

Patient: When I'm in it, it feels like I'm trying to grab control back — if I don't blow up, I’ll look like I let them walk all over me. Under that is this hollow shame, like I'm proving I'm worthless, so I lash out to cover it up. But yeah, how's talking about that in the middle of a blowup supposed to actually stop me from flipping out?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that sense of needing control is really close to what matters for you, even when it feels like it's getting lost in the blowup. What if, instead of trying to control the situation, what mattered most to you right now – like keeping that job or being able to be with your family – could stay present with you even when you were yelling at your coworker?

Patient: Yeah, I get the idea — keeping the job or my family in mind sounds right in theory, but when I'm mad I don't think about any of that, I just want to blow up. How's that supposed to help me in the five seconds before I explode? I've tried telling myself to remember what's important and it doesn't stop me — what do you actually want me to do when I'm about to flip?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: When you're about to blow up, what matters most to you isn't stopping the explosion itself – it's what happens right after. What if, when you feel that anger rising up, you could notice it without acting on it – just for a tiny moment – and see what happens when you do that?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? In those five seconds my brain's gone — I've tried counting to ten or telling myself to "think about the family" and it doesn't stop me. If you mean "notice it," what does that actually look like on the job — take a breath, mutter a phrase, or something else? I'm skeptical, but I'll try if you give me something concrete.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: When you notice that anger showing up, what if, instead of trying to stop it or think about what matters, you could just make room for it to be there – like opening a space for it to exist?

Patient: So you mean don't fight it — just notice it and let it be. On the job that would have to be something quick, like a deep breath, saying to myself "that's anger," and keeping my hands busy instead of snapping — but I've tried naming it before and it didn't stop me, so how is that actually supposed to help when I'm already boiling?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: When you try to name it before, what matters is that the blowup happens, not that you can stop it. What if, when you're already angry, you could just do that one small thing with your hands – what would that feel like?

Patient: Maybe I'd squeeze my fist, grab a rag, or shove my hands in my pockets — anything to stop me from swinging my arms and yelling. It'd feel like pinching down on that knot in my chest — weird and annoying, but maybe it'd buy me half a second to not go full blast. But honestly, I've done breathing and clenching before and it doesn't stick — how's this actually gonna be different when I'm already boiling?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: When you've tried breathing and clenching before and it didn't stick, what if that's because they weren't connected to what matters – what matters is that the blowup happens, not that you can stop it.

Patient: Okay, I get the idea you're saying — but I'm not convinced. When I'm about to blow, telling myself to "think about what's important" or squeezing my fist feels empty. How do I actually tie a quick move to something that matters so it cuts through that boil-up — like a one-word phrase, a tiny physical thing, or something I can do without anyone noticing? I'm skeptical, but if you can give me one concrete thing to try on the job, I'll try it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: I'm not going to give you a new technique. Instead, I want to ask you one more question: What's the smallest, most immediate thing you can do on the job that matters to you, that wouldn't make a difference if you weren't angry – but that might, just might, make it through to the other side?

Patient: Alright — the smallest thing I can do is grab my rag or a wrench, jam my hand around it, squeeze hard, say "steady" once under my breath, and take two slow breaths so my hands stay busy instead of flailing. It feels dumb and like it might not matter, but maybe that squeeze-plus-word could buy me a beat to not go full blast. I’m not convinced it’ll work, but I’ll try it next time and see if it stops me mid-explode.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've found a small step that might help you stay with what matters – not to stop the anger, but to make it through the moment. That's a good place to start.

Patient: Alright, I'll try the rag/wrench squeeze and say "steady," but I'm telling you now — I'm not convinced it'll stop me when I'm already boiling. If it doesn't work next time and I still blow up, what's the actual next move I can do in those five seconds? I'm getting frustrated with all this talk — can we slow down and be real about backup plans if that little trick fails?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: What matters most to you right now isn't that the squeeze works – it's that you can move forward, even if the anger shows up. If you can make room for that anger and keep moving toward what matters, what would that look like for you – not as a "fix" for the anger, but as a way to stay with what matters?

Patient: It'd look like me doing that squeeze-say-"steady" move, keeping my hands and head on the job instead of letting my arms fly, and then showing up for the family stuff afterward even if I'm still pissed. If I do blow up, I own it—apologize, fix whatever I broke, and do something practical to make it right so my job and family don't pay for it. But I'm still skeptical—if the squeeze doesn't stop me and I still flip, what's the actual backup plan? I'm getting frustrated with the vagueness here; can we slow down and map out a concrete next step if this fails?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: What if, when you feel that anger rising up, you could make a choice to keep doing the squeeze-say-"steady" move – not because it will stop the anger, but because it helps you stay present with what matters. And when you do blow up, instead of just owning it and fixing it, what if you could take a moment to connect with what matters most to you, even if it's just for a breath – what matters is that you're showing up for what matters.

Patient: Alright — I can try sticking with the squeeze-and-"steady" move to buy a beat. But if I still flip, I don't want vague stuff; what exactly should I do in that one breath to connect with what matters — mutter "for the kids," take a counted inhale, or do something practical like check the damage and text someone? Be specific — I'm skeptical, but I'll try whatever concrete thing you give me.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're looking for a specific action to take in that one breath. What if, when you feel the anger rising up and you still blow up, you could make a choice to take a single, small step toward what matters to you in that moment – not to fix it, not to calm it, but just to notice what it would mean to show up for it?

Patient: Alright — if I blow up, the one small step I'll try is a single slow, counted inhale (one-two-three), quietly say "for the kids" or "for the job" under my breath while I grab my rag or wrench so my hands are busy. Then I check the damage or send a quick text like "Sorry, I'll sort this" — not to fix how I feel, just to limit the fallout. I'm skeptical it'll do much when I'm boiling, but I'll try it — and if it doesn't work next time, we need a real backup plan, not more vague talk.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've found a concrete action that matters to you – not to stop the anger, but to show up for what matters when you blow up. That's a good place to start. If that doesn't work next time, and you still need a backup plan, what would you do to keep the job and your family safe while you figure out what to do with the anger?

Patient: Okay — here’s what I actually would do as a backup plan: if the squeeze/“steady” doesn’t cut it, I step away for 2–5 minutes — to the truck, the porta-potty, whatever — put tools down or lock them up so nobody gets hurt, and text a coworker “need a minute” so someone knows I’m stepping off. I won’t drive home if I’m still wired; I’ll call my sister or a friend to let the family know I might be late so they don’t worry. If I’ve already snapped at someone I’ll send a quick “sorry, I’ll sort this” text and then fix whatever I can right away. 

But seriously — what if there’s no time to step away? How am I supposed to do that when the boss is watching and the job’s gotta move?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really caught between what matters to you and what matters in the moment, especially when there's no time to step away. What if, instead of trying to step away, what if you could make a choice to keep showing up to what matters – not to the job, not to the anger, but to what matters about the job?

Patient: If you mean focus on the purpose — keeping folks safe, doing the job right so my family gets paid — I can get behind that. So when I can't step away I'll pick one tiny work task as an anchor: tighten a bolt, check a harness, sweep a spot, whatever keeps people safe, and say "steady" or "for the kids" quietly as I do it. That feels more real than breathing and pretending, but I'm still skeptical — if that doesn't yank me back when I'm boiling, what's the actual next move on-site? I'm getting annoyed with hypotheticals; give me a real backup plan.


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: I think we're getting close to what matters. When you're doing that one tiny work task as an anchor, what if, instead of trying to calm the anger, you could actually use that moment to notice what's holding you back – not from doing the task, but from showing up fully to what matters?

Patient: It's hard to even get through this right now, but if I'm honest the thing that holds me back is a heavy shame and this fear I'll look weak or like I can't handle my life. Naming it might help sometimes, but I'm skeptical it’ll do squat in two seconds — what exactly do you want me to notice or say in that split second so it actually lands?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto that shame and fear because it feels like it's connected to your sense of being in control – of your life, of your job, of your family. What if, in that moment, you could notice that shame and fear not as "you," but as "this" – as the weight that's showing up when you try to tighten that bolt or sweep that spot?

Patient: Maybe I try noticing it as "this" — like whispering "that's shame" or "that's fear" while I tighten the bolt. Feels kind of lame and I'm running on fumes, so how's that actually gonna cut through when I'm already boiling?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: Noticing it as "that's shame" or "that's fear" might be a tiny step, but what if, when you're tightening that bolt, what matters most to you isn't the shame or fear – what matters is that the job gets done, that your family gets paid, and that you can breathe again tomorrow.

Patient: Yeah... I can try that — tighten the bolt, whisper "that's shame" or "that's fear," and think "for the kids" while I do it. Feels small and kinda dumb and my energy's shot, but I'll give it a go. If that still doesn't pull me back when I flip, tell me one concrete two-second backup I can do on-site — no fluff.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: If that doesn't work, and you still feel like you're about to blow up, here's what you can do for 2 seconds: *lock the tools in the truck*.

Patient: Alright... I can do the lock-the-tools thing — seems simple enough and might stop me from flinging stuff. But if the boss is right there, locking up could look like I'm walking off; how am I supposed to do that without getting in trouble? And if that still doesn't stop me, what's the next concrete two-second move?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: If locking the tools makes you feel like you're walking off, what if you could make the lock-the-tools action *right there* on the job, without leaving your post?

Patient: Yeah... I can try that — pretend to check a bolt, slide the wrench into the box and click it shut without actually walking off, so it looks like I'm still working. Might buy me a second to not fling stuff, but if that doesn't do it, what's the next real two-second move on-site? I'm running on fumes here, so keep it simple.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: If that doesn't work, *make a phone call*.

Patient: Call who — my sister or one of my mates? I can't do a proper call on-site and the boss'll think I'm walking off. I guess I could ring, say "need a minute," hang up — but how's that actually supposed to help in two seconds? And if they don't pick up, what's the next move?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Call your sister. Just dial her number and say "need a minute" – that's the only two seconds that matters.

Patient: Fine... I'll try calling my sister and say "need a minute." But what if she doesn't pick up — do I hang up and fake-check a bolt, or text her? And if she does pick up, what exactly should I say in two seconds so it sounds urgent but not like I'm quitting? Also—if the boss sees me dial, what do I say to him so it doesn't look like I'm walking off? I'm running out of energy here; give me the exact short lines to use.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: If she doesn't pick up, hang up. If she does, say "I need to talk to you about something" or "I need to take a minute."

Patient: Alright... I can try that. If she picks up I'll say, in a quick two seconds, "Hey — I need a minute, can you call me back?" If she doesn't pick up I'll hang up and pretend to check a bolt or slide the wrench back so it looks like I'm still working. If the boss notices me dial, I'll say "Just needed a quick sec, I'm good" or "Give me one minute" and keep it tight. I'm not sold this'll work, but I'll try it — and if that still doesn't stop me, what's the next real move?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: If that still doesn't work, *step away for 2 minutes*.

Patient: Okay... I can try stepping away for two minutes — put the tools down and go to the truck. But if the boss is right there or there's no one to cover, that could look like I'm walking off and get me in shit; what do I actually say to him when I come back so it doesn't look like I'm slacking? And if two minutes doesn't do jack, what's the next real move — I'm running on fumes here.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: When you come back, say "I need to make a phone call" or "I need to step away for a minute." That acknowledges you're taking care of something important without making it sound like you're abandoning the job.

Patient: Alright... I can say that when I come back — “I need to make a phone call” or “give me a minute.” If the boss presses and asks why, can I just say “personal, I’ll be right back” and keep it short — is that believable? And if two minutes doesn’t help, what’s the next real on-site move, because I’m running on empty and I don’t want another vague plan.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: If the boss presses, saying "personal" is fine. If they ask why, you can just say "it's personal" and that's it. If two minutes still doesn't work, *walk to your truck and lock it*.

Patient: Okay... I can try walking to the truck and locking it if two minutes doesn't cut it, but if the boss sees me that could look like I'm walking off — what do I say when I come back? And what if there's no truck or it's unsafe to leave my post — how's that supposed to help then? I'm running on fumes thinking through all these backups; if locking the truck doesn't stop me, give me one last concrete two-second move that actually does something.
