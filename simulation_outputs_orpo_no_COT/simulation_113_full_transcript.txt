Patient: I've been putting things off more than usual to avoid how anxious and unsettled I feel about recent changes and the money worries. I guess I use procrastination to numb those uncomfortable feelings, and it's spilling into my work as a manager. I don't know, talking about this feels... awkward.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that anxious, unsettled feeling showing up, you quickly reach for procrastination as a way to make it go away. And now, it's starting to affect your work with your team.

Can you imagine what might happen if, instead of trying to push those feelings away, you made space for them to be there – even just for a tiny moment – while you were working?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it sounds okay in theory, but in practice I freeze — deadlines and money worries take over and I start putting things off. Maybe I could try just noticing the feeling for a minute, but I'm worried that'll make me fall behind.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from falling behind, but that's actually where the anxiety and freeze happen – when you start to worry about the consequences.

What if, instead of trying to notice the feeling for a minute, you started with just one tiny step – like making a cup of coffee or taking a deep breath while you're already at your desk?

Patient: I guess I could try that — like making a cup of coffee or taking two slow breaths before I open an email. I don't know, it feels almost too small and I'm worried it won't stop me from spiraling when I see the to-do list. Could you help me think of a simple cue so I actually remember to do it when I start to freeze?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: When you notice that freeze happening, what's one thing that you can actually control in that moment – like the feeling of your feet on the ground or the sound of the air moving in and out of your body?

Patient: I guess I can control my breathing — like taking two slow, deliberate breaths — and feel my feet on the floor. I don't know, maybe putting my hands on the desk or naming three things I can see could help ground me. I'm worried it'll feel silly and I’ll still freeze when the inbox pings.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try those small steps, even if it feels a little awkward or silly. What if, instead of trying to control everything, you made room for it to be okay if you still freeze – just for a moment – and then noticed what happens after that?

Patient: I don't know. I guess part of me thinks giving myself a moment could help, but I'm scared it'll just turn into more procrastination and I'll fall further behind. Maybe I could try something tiny — two slow breaths and naming three things — but I worry I won't remember or it'll feel pointless. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed talking about this.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Let's take a break from talking about it for a moment. Would you be okay with sitting here in silence for just 30 seconds, noticing what's going on in your body and mind?

Patient: I guess I can try. I don't know if I can stay completely silent — silence makes me jittery — could you stay with me and tell me when the 30 seconds are up? I'll try to notice my breathing and my feet on the floor.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: I'll be here with you. When I count to 30, you can start noticing your breathing and your feet on the floor.

Patient: Okay, I guess I'm ready. Please start when you are — I'll try to notice my breath and my feet, though I don't know if I can stay still; my mind will probably jump to the to-do list. Could you tell me when the 30 seconds are up?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... 21... 22... 23... 24... 25... 26... 27... 28... 29... 30.

(I'll wait for a moment before speaking again.)

Patient: I tried. My breathing was there and I could feel my feet, but my mind kept ricocheting to the inbox and the bills. I guess I felt a tiny bit calmer for a moment, but then the worry rushed back and it felt awkward. I don't know—can we try to come up with a simple, not-silly reminder I can actually use at my desk when I start to freeze?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you noticed the tiny calm moment, and then the worry came back – that's okay. What if, instead of trying to push it away, you just remembered that one tiny moment of calm – even if it was just for a second – and said to yourself, "I've got this."

Patient: I guess I could try that — saying "I've got this" when I notice that tiny calm. I don't know, it sounds a bit cheesy and I worry it won't help when the inbox pings. Maybe a sticky note on my monitor or a little phone chime could actually remind me. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about all this; can we slow down and focus on one tiny, realistic step I can actually remember?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on just one tiny step. What if, when you notice your feet on the floor and your breathing, you simply looked down at the sticky note on your monitor – just for a second – and said to yourself, "I've got this." No need to change anything, no need to push away the worry. Just noticing the note and saying that one word.

Patient: I guess I could try putting a sticky note on my monitor that just says "Breathe" and looking at it after two slow breaths. I don't know, it still feels a bit silly and I'm worried I'll ignore it when the inbox pings. Can we slow down and pick one spot and one word that feels less cheesy so I might actually use it?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on just one spot and one word. What if, when you notice your feet on the floor and your breathing, you simply looked down at the sticky note on your monitor that says "Breathe" – but only for a second – and didn't do anything else? No trying to change it, no pushing away the worry. Just noticing the word "Breathe".

Patient: I guess I could try that, but "Breathe" feels a bit cheesy to me. I don't know—maybe something shorter like "Pause" or even just a small dot would feel less silly. Can we slow down and pick one word and one spot that won't make me roll my eyes when the inbox pings?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on one word and one spot that feels manageable. What if you looked down at a small dot on your monitor – just a tiny dot – and said to yourself, "Pause" when you noticed your feet on the floor and your breathing?

Patient: I guess I'll try a small plain black dot on the bottom-right of my monitor and the word "Pause" — something simple so it doesn't feel cheesy. I don't know if it'll actually catch me when the inbox pings; could you help me think of a quick way to make that cue show up right when I open email? I'm getting a bit jittery talking about this — can we slow down a little?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on making that dot appear when you open email. What if you set up a keyboard shortcut – like Ctrl+Space – so that when you press it, a small black dot appears on the screen? That way, when you open email and press Ctrl+Space, the dot shows up right away, and you can use it to pause for a moment.

Patient: I guess that could work in theory, but I don't know how to set up keyboard shortcuts and I'm worried I'll forget to press it when the inbox pings. Maybe something automatic would be better — like the email window showing a tiny dot when it opens, or even a small sticker on the corner of my keyboard so it's there without me having to remember. I don't know, can we slow down and pick the simplest thing I can actually manage?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on something super simple. What if, when you open your email, you just notice that there's a small sticker on the corner of your keyboard – that tiny dot is already there, and it doesn't require you to remember to press anything?

Patient: I guess that actually might be the simplest — a tiny sticker on the keyboard corner that's already there when I open email. I don't know, I'm still worried I won't notice it when the inbox pings; maybe my phone needs one too or somewhere my hands naturally go. I'm getting a bit jittery talking about this — can we slow down and just decide exactly where to put it and what it should look like?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on making a small decision. What if you put a tiny sticker on the corner of your keyboard where your mouse pointer used to be – the spot where you naturally click when scrolling or selecting things?

Patient: I guess I could try that — put a tiny sticker where I usually click on the keyboard. I don't know, I'm worried I still won't notice when I'm panicking; maybe also one on my phone near the home button so it's harder to miss. Can we slow down? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed deciding this.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: Let's take one small step. What if you just put the tiny sticker on your keyboard, right where your mouse pointer used to be – just for today, and just for one email session?

Patient: I guess I can try putting the tiny sticker on the keyboard just for today and for one email session. I don't know—I'm worried I still won't notice it when I start panicking; could you help me pick the exact spot and maybe remind me once before I open email? I'm getting jittery, can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on just one thing. What if you put the tiny sticker right where the cursor would be when you're about to type your first word in the email?

Patient: I guess I can try putting the tiny sticker right where the cursor sits when I start an email — maybe a small black dot about the size of a pencil eraser. I don't know if it'll catch me when I'm panicking; could you remind me once right before I open my inbox today? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed deciding this.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Let's make a small plan. I'll remind you to put the sticker right where the cursor sits when you open your inbox today, and you can try putting the small black dot – about the size of a pencil eraser – there.

Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds doable — I'll try putting the small black dot where the cursor sits, just for today. I don't know, I'm still worried I'll miss it when I start panicking; could you remind me once right before I open my inbox today? I'm getting jittery thinking about actually doing it, so can we slow down a bit and figure out exactly when you'll remind me?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: Let's make a tiny plan. I'll remind you 5 minutes before you open your inbox today. Just 5 minutes before you start checking email, I'll say "Remember to put the sticker there." That way, you'll have a tiny bit of time to focus on doing it, even when you're feeling anxious.

Patient: I guess that sounds okay — I'll try. I don't know if I'll remember, so could you send the reminder here as a quick message five minutes before I open my inbox? I'm getting kind of jittery about actually doing it; can we slow down and do a short run-through now so it feels less weird?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: I'll wait for you to open your inbox. In 5 minutes, I'll send a quick message here saying "Remember to put the sticker there." 

For now, let's just imagine you're about to open your inbox. What happens if you take a deep breath and look at the cursor where you put the small black dot?

Patient: I guess if I take a deep breath and look at the cursor with the dot, there's a tiny shift — my shoulders relax a bit and my head stops racing for a second. Then my mind jumps to the bills and the unread messages and my chest tightens and I want to shut it all down. I don't know, it feels awkward and like it might just be a momentary trick I won't stick with. Can we slow down and maybe rehearse exactly how long to pause and what to do if the panic comes back?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Let's break it down. When you notice your shoulders relaxing and your head stops racing – that's the small shift you mentioned – what's the next moment that matters? Not the panic, not the bills, but what's right after that shift?

Patient: I don't know. I guess the next moment is when I actually make one tiny move—like hovering my fingers over the keyboard or opening the first message—and there's this small, almost-noticeable "okay" before my mind starts yelling about the bills. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and practice what that first tiny action would actually look like?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Let's focus on that tiny move – hovering your fingers over the keyboard. What would it look like, right before you make that move, if you said to yourself, "I'll just put my finger on the spacebar for 2 seconds"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess right before I'd feel my chest tighten and my fingers fumble, then I'd rest one finger on the spacebar for two seconds and try to take a slow breath. It feels a bit awkward to rehearse, and I'm getting jittery—can we slow down and practice that once or twice?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: Let's try it once. Just for a moment, let's imagine you're sitting with your fingers hovering over the keyboard, and you say to yourself, "I'll just put my finger on the spacebar for 2 seconds." What happens when you rest that finger on the spacebar?

Patient: I don't know — when I actually rest my finger on the spacebar for those two seconds, there's this tiny softening in my chest and my breathing slows a bit, like a little pause. Then my brain bangs on about the bills and the unread messages and I feel the urge to shut it all down again. I guess it felt possible for a second, but can we slow down and try that once more, maybe even count the two seconds together?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: Let's try it again, counting the seconds together. When your finger is on the spacebar, you say to yourself, "One... two..."

Patient: One... two.

I don't know — when I did that my chest softened a bit, but then the worry about bills and the inbox rushed back. I'm getting a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and try that again, maybe even count more slowly so it feels less rushed?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: Let's try it again, counting even slower: "One... slow breath... two..." What happens when you rest your finger on the spacebar and you're just with that one breath?

Patient: I don't know. I guess when I rest my finger there and take that one slow breath my chest actually softens for a tiny moment and the racing eases up a bit. Then the worry about the bills and the inbox sneaks back in and I feel like I want to run. Can we slow down and try counting slowly together one more time?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: Let's try it again, counting really slowly: "One... slow breath... two..." This time, when you rest your finger on the spacebar, I want you to notice that softening in your chest, just for a moment – before the worry shows up.

Patient: I don't know — when you counted really slowly my chest did soften and there was that tiny bit of calm for a second. I guess it feels almost silly how small it is, but it did matter. I'm getting jittery though; can we slow down and try that counting together one more time, maybe staying with the softening for a few more seconds?
