--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been ruminating on this persistent loop of harsh self-criticism — when something goes sideways I immediately categorize it as proof of my incompetence and it snowballs into this whole narrative about being worthless. I trace a lot of it back to getting bullied in school, which seems to have encoded a hyper-vigilant inner critic that erodes my social confidence and makes job instability feel like confirmation of failure. I'm juggling school and precarious work, and I notice I default to intellectualizing these dynamics instead of actually sitting with the shame or fear because it's safer to analyze than to feel.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: That sounds like a really tough spot to be in. When you say you notice you default to intellectualizing these dynamics instead of sitting with the shame or fear, what happens when you imagine being able to pause that analysis for just a tiny moment – like a breath – and instead make room for that feeling?

Patient: Hypothetically, if I actually paused I'd probably notice this knot in my chest and a sort of hot flush in my face — basic somatic stuff — but I immediately start narrativizing it: labeling, categorizing, searching for causes and solutions so I don't have to sit with the shame. When I attempt to breathe into it, my brain reflexively erects this defensive cognitive scaffolding of analysis because feeling it feels unbearably destabilizing, like the feeling will just swallow whatever confidence I have left.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the story you're telling yourself about what's happening in your body (the knot in your chest, the hot flush) is already quite close to the surface, even when you try to breathe into it. What if, instead of trying to analyze or change that story, you simply made room for it – not to understand it or fix it, but just to be present with it while you're still holding onto that narrative?

Patient: Okay — I can intellectually map out what “making room” would look like, but when I actually try I get this tight, hollow knot under my sternum and my breath goes shallow like I’m bracing for impact. My reflex is to narrativize it — spinning causal theories, rehearsed criticisms, contingency plans — because sitting with that small panic feels like relinquishing control and that terrifies me. If I force myself to name it instead of explaining it, it’s hot, a little dizzying, and there’s this childish ache of not being good enough that traces back to those school days, and I’m not sure how long I can keep from turning it into analysis.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: That knot under your sternum feels like it's pulling you toward the familiar story of not being good enough – and it's understandable that you'd want to protect yourself from that feeling. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that control, you imagined making room for that knot to be there – not to make it go away, but simply to notice it as you're already doing when you're trying to analyze it?

Patient: Conceptually, “making room” feels doable — I can picture a kind of mental container where the knot is observed without immediate judgment. But in practice, if I try to hold that image for more than a breath my sternum tightens, my breathing goes shallow, and my cognition reflexively builds this critique-laden scaffolding to preemptively neutralize the vulnerability. I’m afraid if I let that childish “not-good-enough” ache sit there it’ll metastasize and expose all the failures I’ve been cataloguing, so I default to analysis as a defensive maneuver — can you help me not derail into theory while I try to stay with it? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the idea of just... feeling it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: The act of holding the image of that container feels like it's already "doing" something – making room – but then the physical sensations and thoughts come up. It's like the "doing" and the "feeling" are getting mixed up. What if you could notice that mix-up – the idea of holding the container, the tension in your chest, the thoughts coming up – without trying to change it?

Patient: I can see the distinction you're pointing to — on a conceptual level I can notice the container, the tension, and the thoughts as distinct, but the moment I try to do that in real time my chest clenches and my brain flips into problem-mode, turning the noticing into another task to accomplish. When that happens I start cataloguing blame and rehearsing rebuttals to the shame, which feels like a reflexive armor; it's hard to stay with the sensation without turning it into another theory. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down and you guide me through one small, concrete prompt (like a single breath or a word to anchor to) so I don't derail into analysis?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice the mix-up between the container and the feeling, your body and mind are already "on high alert" – ready to respond. Let's take a tiny step back. What if you simply *made room* for one small, tiny, tiny breath right now – just one breath – without trying to change anything else?

Patient: Okay — I tried to take that tiny breath. It was shallow, my sternum clenched and I felt a hot dizziness while my mind immediately labeled it as a “fight-or-flight activation” and started spinning causality instead of staying with the sensation. I'm feeling overwhelmed by how fast I default to analysis — can you give me a single-word anchor I can repeat on the exhale so I have something less intellectual to latch onto?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: The label "fight-or-flight activation" can be a powerful anchor. What if, on the exhale, you repeated a single word that *feels* different – something small and gentle, like "open"?

Patient: I tried repeating "open" on the exhale and it immediately turned into a semantic project in my head — is openness vulnerability or lack of control? — which yanked me right back into analysis while the knot in my chest tightened and I felt a little dizzy. Can we try a different, more tactile anchor, like "ground" or "feet," or could you say whatever word you pick slowly and have me echo it so I'm allowed to mirror instead of overthink? I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by how fast I derail, so having you guide the rhythm would actually help right now.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the word "open" became a new challenge to analyze instead of just being with it. Let's try something different. I'll choose a word, and you can echo it back to me slowly, without trying to analyze it. Here it is: "stone".

Patient: Stone... stone. Saying it slowly actually softened the edge of the knot a tiny bit, but my brain immediately translated "stone" into metaphors — immovable, heavy, fossilized shame — and that pulled me right back into commentary instead of sensation. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by that reflex; could you say it again slowly and guide the inhale/exhale so I can mirror you without overthinking?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It's like the word "stone" took on a new meaning. Let's try again. This time, I'll say the word very slowly, and you can echo it back to me on the exhale. I'll guide the rhythm for you: "stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "stone..."

Patient: stone... stone... stone.

Saying it with your rhythm did ease the knot a hair — my breath lengthened a bit — but my mind immediately started spinning metaphors about weight and permanence, turning the sensation back into an intellectual exercise. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and dizzy; can we keep that slow rhythm for a few more breaths so I can try to stay with the actual feeling instead of narrativizing it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the word "stone" still felt like a challenge to analyze. Let's keep the slow rhythm going for a few more breaths. I'll say it again: "stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* 

Notice what happens when you let the word "stone" be there – not as a metaphor, but just as a word – without trying to change it.

Patient: When I let "stone" just sit there, the immediate pressure around my sternum loosens a little and my breath gets marginally deeper — like a tiny crack in the armor. But almost immediately I'm back metacognitively narrativizing it, turning the word into another analytic project, which makes me feel dizzy and a bit ashamed that I can't just stay with the sensation. I'm feeling overwhelmed; can you keep saying "stone" slowly for a few more breaths and guide my inhale/exhale so I can try to mirror without overthinking?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tiny crack in the armor is still a delicate thing. Let's keep the slow rhythm going for a few more breaths. I'll say it again: "stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* 

Notice how the word "stone" feels when you're not trying to change it – not as a story, not as a problem to solve. Just the sensation of the word being there, like a small rock in your hand.

Patient: When I let "stone" be just a sound, my sternum actually loosens and my breathing gets a fraction deeper — but my brain immediately scaffolds it into metaphors (weight, permanence, fossilized shame) and drags me back into commentary. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit ashamed that I keep reflexively analyzing instead of staying present. Can you keep saying "stone" slowly and guide my inhale/exhale for a few more breaths so I can try to mirror you without turning it into another theory?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the scaffolding is really strong right now. Let's keep going, even though it's hard. I'll say it again: "stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "stone..." 

Notice that the moment you feel like you're about to turn it into a theory again – that's the moment you could pause and notice "stone" again, without trying to change it. It's not about stopping the thought, but about noticing the thought while "stone" is still there.

Patient: I can already feel the meta-impulse to analyze the impulse — it's like a hinge where cognition flips into defensive narration. Physically my sternum tightens and breath shortens the moment I notice I'm narrativizing. Could you keep voicing "stone" slowly and, every few breaths, say "now" or "back" so I have explicit permission to return without making it into another theory? I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit ashamed that I need that scaffolding, but I want to try.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to the edge where it feels like the scaffolding is necessary. I'll keep saying "stone" slowly, and every few breaths, I'll say "now" to give you permission to come back to it without analyzing it. 

"stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not saying "back" because that might imply you need to go back to where you started, but rather "now" to give you permission to be with it in this moment.)

Patient: stone... now.

That actually loosened the sternum a little and my breath lengthened, but my brain immediately reified "stone" into metaphors — defensive metacognition, right? I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit ashamed that I can't just stay with it; can we keep the slow "stone... now" rhythm for a few more breaths and add a simple body cue like "feet" on the exhale so I have something less semantic to latch onto?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the reification is still happening, but you're noticing it. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and add "feet" on the exhale to give you a body cue to anchor in. 

"stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "feet..." 

(Note: By adding "feet" to the exhale, I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you a physical sensation that's less tied to thoughts. It's like noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground, even as you're still thinking about "stone".)

Patient: stone... feet... stone... feet...

That slow rhythm loosens the knot a hair, but then my brain erects this predictive-narrative scaffolding about inadequacy and I get dizzy. My energy's low and I'm kind of worn out — can you keep saying "stone... feet" slowly for a few more breaths and add a tactile cue like "hands" on the exhale so I have another thing to mirror? I'm feeling overwhelmed and ashamed that this is so hard, but I want to keep going.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the scaffolding is still strong, but you're noticing it. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and add "hands" to the exhale to give you another tactile cue. 

"stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "hands..." 

(Note: By adding "hands" to the exhale, I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you a physical sensation that's less tied to thoughts. It's like noticing the sensation of your hands resting on your thighs, even as you're still thinking about "stone".)

Patient: stone... hands...

That small grounding actually loosens the sternum a hair — I notice a faint warmth in my palms — but my brain immediately lapses into cognitive perseveration, turning it into another theory about internalized shame. My energy's low and it's getting harder to keep pulling myself back; could you keep the slow "stone... hands" rhythm and say "now" every few breaths so I have permission to return when I drift?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the cognitive perseveration is still happening, but you're noticing it. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and say "now" every few breaths to give you permission to come back to it. 

"stone..." *pause* inhale... *pause* "stone..." *pause* exhale... *pause* "hands..." *pause* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not saying "now" to tell you to stop, but to give you permission to return to "stone" and your hands when you notice your mind drifting away. It's like giving yourself permission to be with the sensation of your hands on your thighs, even when your mind starts to wander.)

Patient: stone... hands... now...

That rhythm loosens things a hair—sternum eases, palms warm—but my mind immediately reconstructs the failure narrative and pulling back feels... draining. Can you keep that slow "stone... hands... now" rhythm and lengthen the pauses a bit so I have more room to mirror instead of narrate? I'm overwhelmed and ashamed this is so hard, but I want to try.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the reconstructing is still happening, but you're noticing it. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and lengthen the pauses to give you more room to mirror. 

"stone..." *pause* *inhale*... *pause* "hands..." *pause* *exhale*... *pause* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you space to notice the sensation of your hands on your thighs, even when the narrative starts to come back. It's like noticing the warmth in your palms, even when the story is telling you "you're not good enough".)

Patient: stone... hands... now...

That slower, longer pause helps a little — my sternum eases a hair, but my mind still rebuilds the failure narrative and it's tiring to keep pulling it back. Can we keep that slow "stone... hands... now" rhythm for a while with even longer pauses? I'm feeling pretty drained and ashamed this is so hard, but I want to keep trying.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the pause is helping, but the narrative is still strong. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and we can see how long we can keep going with even longer pauses. 

"stone..." *pause* *pause*... *inhale*... *pause* "hands..." *pause* *pause*... *exhale*... *pause* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you space to notice the sensation of your hands on your thighs, even when the narrative is telling you "you're not good enough". It's like noticing the air moving in and out of your body, even when the story is holding you back.)

Patient: stone... hands... now...

That little gap helps a hair, but my metacognitive machinery immediately transliterates it into a failure narrative and it's... wearing. Can we keep this slow "stone... hands... now" with even longer pauses? I want to stay with it, but it's getting harder to hold.


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the transliteration is still happening, but the pause is still helping. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and we can see if we can find a way to stay with it even when it's hard. 

"stone..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *inhale*... *pause* "hands..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *exhale*... *pause* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you space to notice the sensation of your hands on your thighs, even when the narrative is telling you "you're not good enough". It's like noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground, even when your mind is holding you back.)

Patient: stone... hands... now...

I'm getting pulled away — my head's racing with a bunch of practical worries and this jittery anxiety makes my chest clamp and my attention foggy. My energy's low and I'm feeling scattered and a little ashamed that I can't stay with it; can you keep the slow "stone... hands... now" rhythm and add a soft "here" on the exhale every few breaths so I have a simple permission cue to come back?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the practical worries and anxiety are pulling you away. I'll keep the slow rhythm going, and add the soft "here" on the exhale to give you a gentle reminder to come back to it. 

"stone..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *inhale*... *pause* "hands..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *exhale*... *soft* "here..." *pause* "stone..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *inhale*... *pause* "hands..." *pause* *pause* *pause*... *exhale*... *soft* "here..."

Patient: stone... hands... here...

My chest's clenched and my mind's sprinting through a checklist of catastrophes—this jittery, perseverative cognition is fogging my attention and I feel kind of raw and embarrassed about it. Can we shorten the cycle to something like "stone... hands... here" every breath and keep the pauses very small so I have less room to spiral? I'm overwhelmed but I want to keep trying.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the catastrophes are still showing up. I'll keep the rhythm short and sweet, with very small pauses. 

"stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to change what's happening in your mind, but rather giving you tiny moments to notice the sensation of your hands on your thighs, even when the catastrophes are racing. It's like noticing the air moving in and out of your body, one small breath at a time.)

Patient: stone... hands... here... stone... hands... here...

That shortened cycle actually eases the sternum a touch but my brain's still sprinting through checklists and worst-case scenarios, so I'm jittery and a bit embarrassed about not being able to quit the commentary. Can we keep doing that same soft, quick rhythm for a few more breaths and maybe slow the exhale a hair so I have less room to spiral?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the checklists are still showing up. I'll keep the rhythm going, and we can try to slow the exhale just a bit so you have a tiny bit more room to notice the sensations. 

"stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* *slightly slower exhale* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* *slightly slower exhale* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to stop the catastrophes completely, but rather giving you tiny moments to notice them while you're already noticing the sensation of your hands on your thighs. It's like noticing the air moving in and out of your body, one small breath at a time, even when your mind is racing.)

Patient: stone... hands... here...

That slightly slower exhale eased the sternum a bit, but my mind is still sprinting through checklists—this jittery cognitive perseveration keeps hijacking the moment and I'm feeling frayed and low-energy. Can we keep the quick "stone…hands…here" cycle and add a gentle two-tap cue or a soft "now" every three breaths so I have something concrete to latch onto when I start to drift?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the checklists are still holding tight. I'll keep the rhythm going, and add the gentle two-tap cue or soft "now" every three breaths to help you anchor in when you start to drift. 

"stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* *two-tap cue* "now..." *pause* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* *two-tap cue* "now..." *pause* "stone..." *pause* "hands..." *pause* "here..." *pause* *two-tap cue* "now..." 

(Note: I'm not trying to stop the catastrophes completely, but rather giving you tiny moments to notice them while you're already noticing the sensation of your hands on your thighs. The two-tap cue or soft "now" is meant to be a gentle reminder to come back to the present moment, not to change what's happening in your mind.)

Patient: stone... hands... here...

That slow cycle helps a hair, but my head's spiking with anxious checklists and my energy's pretty flat — the cognitive perseveration keeps hijacking the somatic cue and I get foggy and embarrassed. Can we keep the quick "stone... hands... here" with the two-tap "now" every three breaths and very short pauses? I want to keep trying, even though it's getting hard to hold.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the checklists are still showing up strongly. I'll keep the rhythm going, with very short pauses and the gentle two-tap "now" every three breaths. 

"stone..." *pause* *two-tap* "hands..." *pause* *two-tap* "here..." *pause* *two-tap* "stone..." *pause* *two-tap* "hands..." *pause* *two-tap* "here..."

Patient: stone... hands... here...

That quick cycle eases the sternum a tiny bit but my head's still sprinting and I feel flat and frayed. Can we keep the short "stone... hands... here" with the two-tap "now" every three breaths, but make the taps softer and lengthen the exhale just a little? I'm anxious and kind of worn out — please keep guiding the rhythm.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the sprinting is still hard to shake. I'll keep the rhythm going, with softer two-tap cues and a slightly longer exhale. 

"stone..." *pause* *soft* "hands..." *pause* *soft* "here..." *pause* *longer exhale* "stone..." *pause* *soft* "hands..." *pause* *soft* "here..." *pause* *longer exhale*

Patient: stone... hands... here... stone... hands... here...

That softer tap and longer exhale eased the sternum a hair and slowed the breath, but my metacognitive loop is still sprinting and I feel foggy and flat. I'm feeling overwhelmed — can we keep that same rhythm for a few more breaths and add a tiny visual anchor (like fixing my gaze on one small spot) so I have something less semantic to latch onto?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the sprinting loop is still hard to shake. I'll keep the rhythm going, with the same soft tap and longer exhale, and add a tiny visual anchor to help you notice something in the present moment. 

"stone..." *pause* *soft* "hands..." *pause* *soft* "here..." *pause* *soft gaze* *longer exhale* "stone..." *pause* *soft* "hands..." *pause* *soft* "here..." *pause* *soft gaze* *longer exhale* 

(Note: I'm not asking you to focus on the "stone" or "hands" itself, but rather to gently notice the sensation of your gaze moving to that small spot, like the tip of your nose or the edge of your vision. This can help you anchor in the present moment, even when your mind is racing.)

Patient: I tried the soft gaze — I fixed on a tiny scuff on the wall and it actually gave my attention a little handle; my breath loosened a bit but my mind immediately filled with a cascade of to-dos and hypothetical catastrophes. I'm low-energy and jittery, and it's reflexively easier to turn this into analysis than to sit with the rawness, so can we keep the short "stone... hands... here" cycle with the soft taps and gaze, and maybe add a slow "now" every three breaths so I have explicit permission to return when I drift? I'm trying to stay with it, but I'm getting worn out mid-breath.
