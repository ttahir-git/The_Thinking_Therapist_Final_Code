Patient: Hey — lately I've been stuck in this loop where a persistent meta-anxiety about my competence in the kitchen hijacks my workflow and paradoxically produces procrastination. Since losing someone close, the usual kinetic energy I bring to service feels blunted, and I catch myself intellectualizing my feelings instead of actually experiencing them, which is both a coping mechanism and kind of exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like when that meta-anxiety shows up, it's not just about the kitchen work itself, but about the story you're telling yourself about needing to be perfect – like you're "not good enough" or "failing" somehow. And when you try to intellectualize those feelings, it's like you're trying to keep the anxiety at bay, but it's still there, making it hard to move forward.

What would happen if you made room for that meta-anxiety – just for a moment – while you're actually standing in the kitchen, trying to cook? Not trying to fix it, but just noticing it, like it's a physical sensation in your body.

Patient: Hypothetically, making room for it would mean treating the anxiety as somatic data — a constriction in my chest, this adrenaline tingle in my palms, a tendency to motor-freeze at critical moments — and simply cataloguing that without launching into self-critique. In theory that kind of momentary acknowledgment could attenuate the recursive story-work that consumes my attention and thereby reduce the procrastination loop, but I'm also afraid that noticing it will magnify it and slow me down during service. I know that reads like a cognitive model instead of an embodied answer — which, honestly, is exactly what I do instead of actually feeling it.

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of noticing the anxiety is tied to the fear of losing control – like if you acknowledge it, you'll get caught up in it even more. 

What if, instead of trying to "make room" for the anxiety, you could try making room for the sensation of trying to avoid it? The sensation of that freeze, the urge to intellectualize – what if you could notice that happening in your body, and then say to it: "I see this happening. I'm not going to change it, but I can choose to notice it while I'm still doing the work."

Patient: That actually lands — I can envision doing a quick, almost clinical label in the moment: "tight chest, motor-freeze, story-making," then nudging myself back to the pass. My worry, though, is that even that micro-label will calcify into another cognitive ritual and escalate the very loop I'm trying to interrupt, which is why I default to elaborate theorizing instead of actually sitting with anything. Can we map out a super-brief, kitchen-friendly cue — like a two-breath anchor or a one-word prompt — that wouldn't feel like another performance task?

Therapist: Let's explore something tiny that might be just enough to help you sit with the sensation without adding another layer of thinking. What if, right before you reach for the stove, you simply said to yourself: "Start." No explanation, no justification – just "Start."

Patient: Okay — that actually lands as plausibly useful. My immediate reflex is to lexicalize it into another performance metric, though: if I don't "Start" fast enough, I already hear the failure narrative gearing up. Could we make it a neutral micro-ritual — like whisper "Start," inhale twice, and then just move — something so tiny it can't be judged? Would you want me to try it tonight on a simple ticket and notice any somatic shift, then report back?

Therapist: Let's keep it tiny. What if, instead of a verb, we use a word that's more about presence – like "Here". Just whisper "Here" to yourself, inhale twice, and then move towards the stove. No expectation, no performance – just notice what happens when you say that word.

Patient: Okay — that actually feels doable. I can conceptualize "Here" as a micro-liminal anchor that interrupts the anticipatory narrative and converts it into a somatic event: whisper, inhale twice, move. My immediate meta-worry is predictable — I'll turn the latency into a metric and start judging myself for how quickly I "land" — but I'm willing to try it tonight on a simple ticket and notice whether the chest tightness shifts or I just produce another rubric. I'll do it and report back what the body actually does, not just the theory.

Therapist: That sounds like a great way to start. Remember, it's just about noticing what happens when you do the small ritual – not about whether you're "doing it right" or not. Just the fact that you're willing to try it tonight is a big step.

Patient: Alright — I'll try it tonight on a simple ticket: whisper "Here," inhale twice, then move. I can already predict the meta-narrative will try to convert that into a KPI — measuring latency, execution, and then shaming me for any variance — which, predictably, is my default intellectualization. If that judgment ping shows up mid-service, what's a kitchen-friendly micro-response I can use that won't just become another checkmark? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down and unpack what that contingency might actually look like in real time?

Therapist: Let's take a step back. When you notice the judgment pinging up, what's the physical sensation in your body right then – not the thought, but the sensation of it? Just notice what's happening with your chest, shoulders, or hands.

Patient: It's a constricting band across my chest—breath gets shallow and quick—my shoulders hitch up and my hands go a little cold and fidgety, like they want to fold into my pockets or freeze over the prep. Almost immediately my brain starts narrating the sensation into a taxonomy—why I'm tense, what that tension predicts—so it's hard not to leap into analysis instead of just feeling the tightness. Does that map sound useful, or do you want me to try holding just one of those sensations for a breath and report what shifts?

Therapist: That sounds like a clear picture of what's happening when you notice the judgment pinging up. It's like you're already describing it like a story – "my brain starts narrating the sensation into a taxonomy" – which is actually just another way of noticing the thinking that's happening when you feel the tightness.

What if, instead of trying to analyze it, you simply noticed the feeling of the constricting band across your chest for just one more breath? Not to change it, not to fix it, just to notice it – like you're holding a small, physical space for that sensation to be there.

Patient: Okay — I can imagine doing that: allotting one breath as a tiny act of somatic witnessing. My immediate meta-worry is that it will become another metric to fail at, but if I actually pause I predict the band will loosen a notch, my shoulders will drop a little, and my hands might stop wanting to clamp up — and then, predictably, the narrative will start annotating the experience. I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed thinking about trying it mid-service; can we pick a single, nonjudgmental fallback word I can say if the narration pings in—something that won't feel like another performance?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing the pattern of trying to hold onto the feeling while it's still tight – which makes sense. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto it, you simply said "open" to yourself if the narrative pings up? Not to change the feeling, but just to acknowledge it's there – like you're giving yourself permission to notice it.

Patient: "Open" actually lands—it reads as permission rather than a to-do, which feels less antagonistic. My immediate meta-worry, though, is predictably that I'll metricize it into another performance rubric, so attaching it to an exhale (whisper "open" on the out-breath) might make it feel more like letting go than executing. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed imagining adding rituals mid-service; can we agree on keeping it to that single exhale cue and then I'll try it on a simple ticket tonight and report what the body does?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that adding another step (attaching it to an exhale) might make it feel like you're trying to control the experience instead of just noticing it.

Let's agree to keep it simple: just whisper "open" on the out-breath tonight, and notice what happens without adding any expectations or performance tasks.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the exhaled "open" tonight. Metacognitively I can already feel the narrative scaffolding trying to convert it into a KPI, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just imagining that happening mid-service. Quick clarification: if I'm in the middle of a rush and whispering feels impractical, is a silent, internal "open" on the exhale still faithful to the exercise? I'll test it on a simple ticket and report back with what the body actually does, not just the theory.

Therapist: If whispering feels impractical, a silent "open" on the exhale can still be a way to connect with the feeling without adding more complexity. The goal is to notice the sensation of the constricting band across your chest, not to perform a ritual that feels forced.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is a silent "open" on the exhale supposed to actually modulate that tight band when I'm three tickets deep? It feels like swapping one covert ritual for another, and I'm already getting overwhelmed imagining that extra choreography mid-service. Can you give a concrete micro-example of what I should notice in the first 5–10 seconds after the internal "open" so I don't just turn it into another KPI?

Therapist: Let's try to simplify it. Imagine you're 3 tickets deep and you whisper "open" on the exhale. As soon as you say it, notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Not the tightness in your chest, not the narrative, just the sensation of your feet on the floor. That's the first 5-10 seconds after saying "open".

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it feels like you're asking me to pivot attention to something almost arbitrarily distant from the constricting band, which sounds more like displacement than intervention. Concretely: in those first 5–10 seconds after a silent "open," what exactly should I expect to notice in my feet — pressure at the heels, a shift forward, warmth, pins-and-needles? I can already feel the meta-narrative ready to metricize whatever comes up, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just imagining adding another observation to my service choreography. Can we slow down and unpack a single, kitchen-friendly sensory sign I can look for so this doesn't become another thing to fail at?

Therapist: You're right that noticing the sensation in your feet might feel like displacement. 

Let's try to simplify it even further. In those first 5-10 seconds after a silent "open", notice if your hands feel heavier or lighter. Not trying to change that, just noticing what happens.

Patient: Okay — I can try that: after the silent "open" I'll check for 5–10 seconds whether my hands feel heavier or lighter. My instinct is to immediately annotate and metricize the result, so if that ping happens mid-service can I just label it "heavier" or "lighter" and let it sit without commentary? I'll test it on a simple ticket tonight and report what the hands actually do, not the story.

Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. If you notice your hands feeling heavier or lighter after the silent "open", you can label it as "heavier" or "lighter" without adding any more commentary. The goal is to notice the sensation, not to fix it or change it.

Patient: Okay — I'll try the silent "open" and then for 5–10 seconds just notice whether my hands feel "heavier" or "lighter" and label it without commentary. I can already hear the meta-narrative queuing up to turn that into data, and I'm kind of drained imagining yet another micro-task mid-rush. One practical thing: if there's no perceptible change or I can't tell, what's the simplest neutral label I should default to so it doesn't become another thing to fail at?

Therapist: If there's no change, and you can't tell if your hands feel heavier or lighter, the simplest neutral label you can default to is: "same". That way, you're not adding any judgment or commentary, and you're still acknowledging that you noticed your hands.

Patient: Okay — I'll default to "same" if there's no perceptible change. Plan: silent "open" on the exhale, 5–10 seconds scanning my hands, then internally label heavier/lighter/same. 

I can already feel the meta-narrative itching to metricize this and I'm kind of wiped just imagining another micro-check mid-rush — can we agree on a hard cap: if I can't tell within 5 seconds I just move on, no extra revisits?

Therapist: If you can't tell within 5 seconds, you'll just move on to the next step. No revisiting. That's a clear boundary to help you avoid getting caught up in the narrative.

Patient: Okay — that 5-second hard cap feels doable; I can commit to moving on if nothing's perceptible. I'm already anticipating my brain will lexicalize that boundary into another KPI, which is kind of draining, so can we pick one tiny rehearsal I actually do off-service tonight (two minutes at the pass: silent "open" + 5s hands-scan) so there's some embodied memory to pull from? And if the narrative hijacks me mid-rush, what's the single-syllable internal cue you'd want me to use to snap back to action without layering more ritual on top?

Therapist: For the tiny rehearsal, let's do just 2 minutes at the pass: silent "open" on the exhale, and 5-second hands-scan. 

When the narrative hijacks you mid-rush, your single-syllable internal cue is: "work". Just say "work" to yourself, and gently bring your attention back to the task at hand.

Patient: Okay — I'll do the two-minute rehearsal at the pass tonight: silent "open" on the exhale, 5 seconds scanning my hands, label heavier/lighter/same, and move on if nothing's perceptible. I can already feel my cognition schematizing this into another KPI and, honestly, I'm kind of wiped just thinking about adding one more micro-choreography. Quick clarification: is "work" meant to be strictly internal (silent) so it doesn't attract attention in the kitchen, or is a whispered micro-cue okay if the moment allows? And if a wave of grief actually surfaces mid-rush — do I still do the silent "open" → hands-scan → "work" sequence, or is there a different immediate default you'd want me to use so I don't get lost?

Therapist: When you say "work", it can be either silently internal or a whispered micro-cue – whatever feels most natural in the moment. The goal is to simply bring your attention back to the task without adding more complexity. 

If a wave of grief surfaces mid-rush, your immediate default can be: "breathe". That's not about fixing the grief, but just noticing it while you're still doing the work.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "breathe" reads a little abstract to me when a grief wave actually lands mid-rush. I get this sudden hot shame and my hands feel like they betray me, and an internal "breathe" risks becoming another half-step I forget. Practically: do you mean one slow in/out, a quick three, or something else? And if that doesn't ease it, do I flip to "work" or keep trying to breathe?

Therapist: When a grief wave lands, a slow, short inhale-out (just one slow breath) might feel like a tiny anchor to help you stay present with the physical sensations. It's not about fixing the grief, but just noticing it while you're still doing the work.

If that slow breath doesn't ease the hot shame, your internal cue can shift to: "move". That means taking one small step towards the task, even if it feels like a tiny, insignificant action. It's not about avoiding the grief, but about finding a way to move forward, even when it's hard.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when you say one slow in/out, do you mean a clearly timed inhale/exhale (like a slow three-count) or just one obvious, non-technical breath? If after that breath my chest is still burning and my hands are wobbling, is "move" literally any micro-action (pick up a spoon, step to the pass) or does it need to be something more concrete? Conceptually I get that "move" is behavioral activation, but practically I keep imagining that hot shame spiking and then I'm pissed at myself for being derailed — it's ugly and draining. Can we pin down one example I can actually use mid-service so this doesn't become another abstract thing to fail at?

Therapist: When I say "one slow in/out", I mean a brief, obvious breath – not a timed inhale-exhale, but just one clear, natural breath. It's not about fixing the shame, but about noticing it while you're still doing the work.

If your chest is still burning after that breath, "move" can be a small, concrete action like picking up a spoon or wiping down the counter – anything that helps you connect with the task at hand, even if it feels like a tiny, insignificant action.

To make it more concrete, let's try this: when you notice the hot shame and your hands start wobbling, your single-syllable cue can be: "scoop". Not to fix the shame, but just to notice it while you scoop out that first ingredient – like it's a small, manageable piece of the task that you can do right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "scoop" lands as concretely behavioral, which I actually like, but I can already feel that hot shame flaring and my brain greasing the wheels of critique. Practically: is "scoop" internal or whispered, and is it meant to cue a single, tiny motion (one spoonful) or a broader shift into the task? I'm kind of wiped just thinking about adding another choreography, so can we pick one explicit micro-rehearsal for tonight (two minutes at the pass: silent "scoop" + one spoonful) so I have something embodied to try?

Therapist: When you say "scoop", it can be either whispered or internal – whatever feels most natural in the moment. 

As for the scope, let's focus on just one tiny motion: one spoonful. Not to change the task, but to notice it while you scoop out that first ingredient. It's a small, manageable piece of the work.

For tonight's reheasal, let's do two minutes at the pass: silent "scoop" + one spoonful. That's it. Just that tiny action, and nothing more.

Patient: Okay — I'll do the two-minute rehearsal at the pass: silent "scoop" + one spoonful. I can already feel that hot shame spike—chest tightens, hands clench, and my brain wants to reframe it as another performance metric, which is infuriating and kind of exhausting. Quick practical thing: do you want me to run it right before service so it's freshest, or after prep when things are quieter?

Therapist: When you're ready to rehearse, I'd suggest doing it right before service. The fresh energy of being about to start service might help you stay present with the sensations, even when the hot shame shows up. Plus, it's a great way to test how "scoop" works when it really matters – not just in a quiet moment.

Patient: Okay — I'll try it right before service tonight. Conceptually it seems right, but I'm worried the pre-service adrenaline will collude with that hot shame memory and make the rehearsal feel performative instead of stabilizing. Quick practical question: stick to the two-minute silent "scoop" + one spoonful just once, or repeat it a couple times? And if the pass is already bonkers, is it okay to tuck it into the last five minutes of prep instead? I'm already feeling kind of drained imagining this, but I'll give it a shot and report back on what actually happens.

Therapist: For tonight's rehearsal, let's just do it once: two minutes of silent "scoop" + one spoonful. Don't worry about repeating it if you feel like it's not working – just the one try. If the adrenaline makes it feel performative, that's okay. We're not trying to control it, just notice it while you scoop. And if the pass is already crazy, tucking it into the last five minutes of prep might be a good way to save it for when it really matters.

Patient: Alright — I'll do the single two-minute rehearsal right before service, or shove it into the last five minutes of prep if the pass is bonkers. I'm already hit with that flash of failure — chest clamps, hands go tight — and it makes me want to bail because I'll just turn it into another KPI. Quick clarification: if that flash spikes during the rehearsal, do I do the one slow in/out "breathe" first and then "scoop" the spoon, or skip the breath and just cue "scoop" so I don't get stuck ruminating?

Therapist: If the flash spikes during the rehearsal, I'd suggest doing the one slow in/out "breathe" first. That tiny breath can help you stay present with the sensations, even when they're intense. Then, if you're ready, you can try to do the one spoonful of "scoop". If that feels too overwhelming, skipping the breath and just trying to cue "scoop" might be okay too – but I think the breath might give you a tiny bit more room to move.

Patient: Okay — I'll do the one slow in/out breath, then the silent "scoop" spoonful in the two-minute rehearsal before service. I can already feel that hot shame gearing up — chest clamps, hands jitter — and my meta-narrative will try to transmogrify the whole thing into another KPI, which makes me want to bail. Quick practical thing: if the breath doesn't land and the shame spikes during the rehearsal, should I drop straight to the spoonful, or use a neutral word like "same" and move on?

Therapist: If the breath doesn't land and the shame spikes, I'd suggest using a neutral word like "same" instead of "scoop". Saying "same" doesn't try to fix the shame or change what's happening – it just acknowledges it while you move on to the task. You can use that tiny bit of space to get the spoon out, even if the shame is still there.

Patient: Okay — I'll use "same" if the breath doesn't land. I can already feel that flash of shame—the chest clamps, the irritation at myself—that makes everything feel sticky and performative, and I'm pissed off that I keep turning these tiny stabilizers into metrics. Quick practical thing: should "same" be strictly internal so it stays invisible, and if "same" itself starts to feel like another KPI mid-rush, what's the immediate fallback you want me to do (a single micro-action or a different one-syllable cue)?

Therapist: When you say "same", I want it to be just a tiny whisper, not something you're trying to control or change. If it starts to feel like another KPI, I'd suggest using the one-syllable cue "move" instead. "Move" is a small action that can help you get past the stuckness and just take the next step.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — it still feels like extra choreography and my chest already tightens just thinking about doing it. That flash of shame keeps pinging, and intellectually I can see how "same" → "move" scaffolds behavioral activation, but emotionally I'm flat and kind of wiped. Can we simplify it so that if "same" feels judged I default straight to an internal "move" — no whisper, no breath, just one tiny action?
