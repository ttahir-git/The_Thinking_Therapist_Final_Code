Patient: Hi, I'm a senior small business owner and since my recent move I can't stop imagining that any little slip-up at work will trigger a chain reaction — staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, and I definitely lose the business and everything I've moved for. That nonstop fortune-telling freezes me so I procrastinate instead of actually doing the work.

Therapist: It sounds like when that imagined chain reaction shows up, you feel stuck and paralyzed, and that's when the procrastination starts. Can you tell me what would happen in that moment if you could just make room for that "what-if" story – even for just a tiny fraction of a second – while still showing up to do the work?

Patient: If I even let that "what-if" whisper in for a second it snowballs — I see a staff mistake, I panic, I micromanage, someone quits, clients get annoyed, cash dries up and I'm bankrupt. I try to show up but my hands freeze and I end up scrolling or doing tiny busywork instead of the real stuff. Thinking it could stay small or turn out okay just feels unrealistic to me.

Therapist: So when that imagined chain reaction shows up, it feels like your whole sense of control and safety is tied to being able to prevent it – even if that means you're not showing up to the work that matters. It's like your hands are literally frozen because the thought of losing everything feels so real. What matters to you in that moment – what would you need to feel like you're not just doing busywork, but actually moving toward what matters to you?

Patient: I think I need a guarantee — like a step-by-step plan with clear signs that nothing catastrophic will follow if I do the work. Without that, I just pace and do shallow stuff because it's safer than risking the spiral. And honestly, expecting anyone to promise that feels dumb, so I end up frozen anyway.

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving a sense of control and safety that feels tied to having a clear plan – but when you think about trying to find someone to promise that, it feels like it's not going to work anyway. What if, instead of looking for a guarantee or a plan, you just noticed what matters to you in that moment – like "I need to be able to serve my customers" or "I need to trust myself to make good decisions" – without needing anything else to be true?

Patient: I can tell myself that serving customers or trusting myself matters, but the moment I notice that the fortune-teller kicks in and narrates the collapse — one mistake, angry clients, staff panic, bankruptcy. Saying "notice what matters" feels like a slogan that doesn't touch the panic, so I just go hide in busywork. Honestly, unless I get something concrete to prove it won't blow up, I can't trust that noticing will change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the panic, the "fortune-teller" shows up and you feel like you're back to square one – like nothing's changed. And when you think about noticing what matters, it feels like it's just a way to distract yourself from the panic. What if, instead of trying to "prove" it won't blow up, you could just make room for that noticing – not to change the panic, but to see what's happening when the panic is there?

Patient: I hear you, but when I try to "make room" the fortune-teller doesn't quiet down — it screams that one slip will start the cascade: staff panic, clients leave, cash dries up, I'm ruined. Just watching it feels like letting the collapse happen, not preventing it, so I freeze or busywork instead. I'm getting overwhelmed by this — can we slow down? I'm not sure how noticing won't just feed the spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to "make room" for noticing, the panic feels like it's getting louder, like you're trying to hold onto control when the thought of losing it is so strong. It's like the panic is saying, "If you don't stop it, it'll happen anyway." What if, instead of trying to notice while holding onto control, you could just be with the feeling of overwhelm – without trying to change it – for a tiny moment?

Patient: I can try, but the second I try to sit with it the fortune-teller goes full throttle — one tiny mistake becomes staff quitting, clients vanishing, cash gone, me ruined. It feels like letting the collapse happen instead of preventing it, so I almost immediately panic and start doing busywork. I’m getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don’t buy that just “being with” it won’t make the spiral louder.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to sit with the feeling of overwhelm, it feels like you're letting the panic take over, and the thought of losing control makes it even worse. You're right, "just being with" it might not feel like a way to avoid the spiral. What if, instead of trying to "be with" it or change it, you could look at it like a small, steady hum in the background – one that shows up when you're trying to control the panic?

Patient: A "hum" sounds nicer, but for me that hum instantly turns into a blaring siren — the fortune-teller ratchets it up: one slip, staff freak out, clients bolt, cash gone, me bankrupt. I want to believe it's just background noise, but the minute I try to label it the story grabs me and I end up scrolling or doing busywork instead of the real stuff. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you try to label the hum as "background noise", the siren gets louder, and the story takes over again. When that happens, what matters is that you're stuck – not in the story, but in the feeling of needing to control it. What if, instead of trying to change the story, you could notice what matters right now – not about stopping the siren, but about what shows up when you're trying to make sense of it?

Patient: When I try to make sense of it, my chest tightens and the fortune-teller goes full throttle — one tiny error becoming staff panic, clients bailing, cash gone, me bankrupt. I get ashamed and paralyzed, so I hide in busywork because it feels safer than facing the spiral, and saying "remember what matters" just sounds like a slogan that won't stop it. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I'm not convinced noticing won't just make the story louder.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make sense of it, the tightness in your chest makes the story even more urgent, and the shame and paralysis feel like they're holding you back. When you say "remember what matters", it feels like a way to avoid the feeling, rather than being with it. What if, instead of trying to notice what matters, you could just notice what's happening in this moment – not about stopping the story, but about what's showing up when you're trying to make sense of it?

Patient: When I try to notice what's happening I get flooded — my chest tightens and that fortune-teller goes straight to the worst: staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, I'm definitely ruined. Trying to just observe feels impossible because the story grabs me and I end up frozen or scrolling, like I'm letting the collapse happen instead of stopping it. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I'm not convinced noticing won't just make the spiral louder.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening feels like trying to hold onto a wave – the tighter you try to grasp it, the more it pulls you under. When you say "I'm letting the collapse happen", it's like you're acknowledging that's what's already happening, even if it feels like you're not in control. What if, instead of trying to notice what's happening, you could just acknowledge that feeling of overwhelm – not as a problem to be solved, but as what's showing up right now?

Patient: I get that idea, but when I even try to acknowledge it the fortune-teller goes berserk — one slip, staff freak out, clients bolt, cash dries up, I'm ruined. My chest tightens, I freeze and default to busywork, so "acknowledging" just feels like making the collapse louder. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't see how that would help.

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to acknowledge the feeling feels like pushing the story further – like you're saying, "Okay, fine, I'll notice this, and now it's even worse." When that happens, what matters is that you're stuck – not in the story, but in the feeling of needing to control it. Instead of trying to notice or acknowledge, what if you could just be with that feeling – without trying to change it, or make it smaller, or even notice it – just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I can try, but the second I try to be with it my fortune-teller brain goes full-on: one slip, staff panic, clients bolt, cash dries up, I'm ruined. Sitting with it feels like giving the collapse a microphone, so I freeze and do busywork instead. I'm getting overwhelmed—can we slow down? I'm not convinced this won't make the spiral louder.

Therapist: It sounds like even trying to be with the feeling feels like letting the story take over – like you're giving it a platform. When that happens, what matters is that you're stuck – not in the story, but in the feeling of needing to control it. Instead of trying to notice or be with it, what if you could just... stop.

Patient: Stop? That feels impossible — if I stop, even for a second, the fortune-teller screams that one slip will set off staff panic, clients leaving, cash drying up, and I'm ruined. I'm already flooded and my hands go straight to scrolling; I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of stopping feels like it would trigger the very worst-case scenario – and that's what's keeping you stuck. When that thought shows up, what if you could notice it – not as a reason to keep doing what you're doing, but just as a thought?

Patient: I wish that worked, but the second I label it "just a thought" the fortune-teller gasses up the engine — one mistake, staff panic, clients bolt, cash gone, I'm ruined — and suddenly it's not just a thought, it's a prophecy. Trying to notice it that way just feels like admitting the collapse is possible, and my hands go straight to scrolling or fiddling because I can't cope. I'm getting overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like labeling it as a thought feels like a failure, because it doesn't stop the story from showing up. When that happens, what matters is that you're already doing what matters – noticing what's happening, even if it feels like it's not working. Instead of trying to stop the story, what if you could just... breathe?

Patient: Breathing? I try, but the second I slow down that ugly narrative kicks into overdrive — one slip, staff panic, clients gone, cash gone, I'm ruined — and my chest tightens even more. It also dredges up this shame like proof I already messed up once and will do it again, so my hands go straight to scrolling to avoid it. Can we slow down? I don't see how breathing won't just make the story louder.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to breathe, the story feels like it's going to drown you. When that happens, what if you could notice what matters most to you, right now – not in a way that's trying to stop the story, but in a way that's already showing up even when the chest is tight?

Patient: What matters most is keeping the business running so my staff can get paid and my clients aren't left hanging — and not being that screw-up who ruined everything for my family. But the fortune-teller immediately turns it into a prophecy — one tiny slip and staff bolt, clients drop, cash evaporates, I'm bankrupt — and that shame that I already messed up once just makes me freeze. I'm getting really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like when you say what matters most, the story shows up anyway. Instead of trying to stop the story or make it go away, what if you could just notice the part of you that matters – not the part that's worried about being the "screw-up" or the part that's trying to control everything. What would it be like to notice that part of you, even when the story is there, and what matters to you is showing up?

Patient: I want that part—the one that actually cares about keeping people paid and doing the right thing—but the fortune-teller immediately sneers that noticing it is just denial and that I'm already the screw-up. It makes me feel ashamed and I freeze, my hands go straight to my phone, and I can't even let that part breathe without the collapse story drowning it out. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't see how noticing won't just feed the prophecy.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is so loud that you can't even hear what matters to you – the part that cares about doing the right thing. When that happens, what if you could make room for that part to be small, just for a tiny moment? Not to stop the story, but to notice what matters to you, even when the shame and the fear are there.

Patient: I want that, but the second I try to let that part be small the fortune-teller starts sneering — one slip, staff bolt, clients gone, cash gone, I'm ruined — and the shame surges like proof I already blew it. My hands go straight to my phone and I start scrolling to avoid the panic. I'm really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down? I don't buy that making room won't just feed the prophecy.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for that part, the story shows up anyway, and it feels like it's just more proof that you're the screw-up. When that happens, what if we didn't try to make room for it – but instead, what if we just noticed what's already happening, like your hands reaching for the phone?

Patient: They already are — my hand's on the phone before I even realize it, and the moment I look something in me goes, "See? You already messed up," and the fortune-teller screams the whole collapse: staff quit, clients bail, cash gone, I'm ruined. I feel ashamed and stupid and then I scroll like it's the only thing that keeps the panic from exploding. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice your hand on the phone, the story already has you in a tight grip. In that moment, what would it be like to just notice the feeling of shame without trying to make it true – just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I try to notice it, but the moment I name the shame the fortune-teller turns it into proof I’ve already blown it—my chest tightens and it screams, "one slip, staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, you're ruined." I freeze and my hand goes straight to my phone and I start scrolling to avoid the panic. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down? I don't think I can just sit with it without the story hijacking me.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is already doing its job, and you're not even present with it – you're already gone, reaching for the phone. Can we try something different? What if, right now, without trying to stop the story, you just... let the shame be there? Not to change it, not to make it true, but just to notice it – as it is – while your hand is still on the phone?

Patient: I can't just let it sit — the second I try the fortune-teller starts yelling that I've already ruined everything: staff quit, clients bolt, cash disappears, I'm bankrupt. My chest tightens, my hand's already on the phone, and I start scrolling like it's the only thing that keeps the panic from exploding. I'm ashamed and pissed at myself, and I don't see how "letting it be" won't just turn into proof that I'm a screw-up. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the story is already taking over, and you're not even present with your own feelings – you're already reacting to the shame and the fear. Can we try something really small? What if, just for a tiny fraction of a second, you could notice the feeling of your hand on the phone – not to change it, not to stop the story, but just to notice it – while the fortune-teller is yelling?

Patient: Okay... I'll try to notice my hand for a split second, but the instant I do the fortune-teller goes full blast — one slip, staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, I'm finished. My chest tightens, this shame rushes in like proof I already blew it, and my hand's on the phone before I even realize, and I start scrolling. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing what matters – the feeling of your hand on the phone – but the story is still taking over. When you try to notice the hand, the fortune-teller shows up anyway. What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you could notice what's happening *while* the story is showing up?

Patient: I'll try, but the second I try to notice the story it just revs up — one slip becomes staff quitting, clients bailing, cash gone, I'm ruined. My chest locks, shame floods in like proof I already blew it, and my hand's on the phone before I even know it and I start scrolling. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't think I can "notice while it happens" without it swallowing me.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is already too loud, and you're not even present with your own feelings – you're already reacting to the shame and the fear. What if, instead of trying to notice while it happens, we tried something even smaller? What if you just noticed the sensation of your chest tightening, right now – not because you want to stop the story, but just because that's what's happening?

Patient: My chest's already tightening just thinking about it, and the fortune-teller flips to full disaster mode — one slip, staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, I'm ruined. That shame from messing up before rushes back like proof I already failed, my hand's on the phone before I even know it and I start scrolling to numb it. I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the story is already taking over, and you're not even present with your own feelings – you're already reacting to the shame and the fear. When you notice your chest tightening, the story shows up anyway. What if, instead of trying to stop the story or change it, we just acknowledged what's happening – not to make it better, but just to notice it?

Patient: I’ll try, but the second I even try to acknowledge it the fortune-teller goes full blast — one slip, staff quit, clients bail, cash dries up, I’m ruined. My chest tightens and that shame rushes in like proof I already messed up, my hand’s already on the phone and I start scrolling to avoid the panic. I’m really overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don’t see how just noticing won’t make the story louder.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to acknowledge the story only makes it worse. When you notice your chest tightening and the shame rushing in, what if we didn't try to make it go away – but instead, what if we just noticed it right where it is, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can't — the minute I try to just notice, the fortune-teller goes nuts: my chest locks, shame floods in like proof I'm already the screw-up, and my hand's on the phone before I even realize and I start scrolling. I'm suddenly jittery and can't focus, and noticing just feels like feeding the prophecy, so I'm really overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice, even just for a moment, feels like it's going to make the story even louder. What if, instead of trying to notice, we just... stopped trying to control it for a tiny moment?

Patient: I want to, but the thought of not controlling it makes my brain go berserk — the fortune-teller screams one slip, staff panic, clients leave, cash dries up, I'm ruined. My chest tightens, I'm jittery and can't focus, my hand's already on the phone before I realize and I start scrolling to avoid the panic. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?
