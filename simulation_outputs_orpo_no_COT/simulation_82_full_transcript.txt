--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm in my early fifties and back at school, and lately I've been really anxious about social situations — I tense up at gatherings with friends and usually end up avoiding them. My colleagues are supportive, which helps a bit, but outside of work I just feel overwhelmed and I don't know, I guess I keep pulling away.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: What's interesting is that even when you're with supportive colleagues, you still feel anxious about social situations. It sounds like that avoidance feels like a way to protect yourself from feeling overwhelmed. What matters to you about staying connected with your friends, even if it feels hard right now?

Patient: I guess it matters because I don't want to be completely alone — being around friends makes me feel a little more normal, I don't know. I worry that if I keep pulling away I'll lose those relationships and then I'd just be stuck with the family stuff. But talking about this already makes me uneasy, so I keep circling around it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Noticing how hard it is to talk about this when you feel anxious is really brave. When that unease shows up, what happens to the thought "I worry that if I keep pulling away I'll lose those relationships"? Is it like a whisper that wants to stop you from considering what matters to you about staying connected?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it becomes this loud warning in my head that I should back off, like it's protecting me from being embarrassed or judged. When that happens my chest tightens, my thoughts race with every little thing I might say wrong, and I just want to disappear. Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The warning voice and physical sensations when that happens—chest tightens, thoughts racing—it sounds like it's all connected to the fear of being judged. When you notice that feeling, what matters to you about being able to stay with your friends, even if it's hard, without disappearing?

Patient: I guess what matters is not feeling like an outsider — that someone notices me and I’m not completely alone. But talking about it makes me anxious and I don't know, it's hard to stay with the feeling without wanting to back away, so can we slow down? I feel like I'm rambling.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Noticing that the thought "I'm rambling" shows up when you try to stay with what matters—it sounds like it's connected to the anxiety about being judged. When you notice that feeling of wanting to back away, what would it be like to notice it, just for a moment, while you say to yourself, "I matter to my friends when I'm with them"?

Patient: I don't know, I guess for a moment my chest would still be tight and my thoughts would race, but maybe a tiny part of me would hear that line and feel a little steadier. Then the warning voice would probably jump back in and I'd want to pull away, so can we slow down? I'm trying to stay with it but it's really uncomfortable.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Noticing that tiny part of you that might hear the line and feel a little steadier—it sounds like it's worth exploring, even if the warning voice comes back. What would it be like to stay with that small steadiness, even for just a breath, while you're trying to say to yourself, "I matter to my friends when I'm with them"?

Patient: I don't know, I guess if I could stay with it for a breath my chest might ease a little and things wouldn't spin as fast. But then that warning voice would probably pipe up and tell me I'm faking it, and I'd want to slip away. Can we slow down? I'm getting really anxious and I'm not sure how to keep going without feeling overwhelmed.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: Noticing that the warning voice shows up when you try to stay with that small steadiness—it sounds like it's really hard to make room for it when it matters most. What if, instead of trying to silence the warning voice, you could make room for it right where it is?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I let it be there it might not scream as loud, like it doesn't have to protect me so hard. But just thinking about letting it stay makes my chest tighten and I feel like I'm inviting everything I fear. Can we slow down? I'm getting really unsettled.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: When you notice that tightening and feeling of inviting everything you fear, what's the story that's happening in your mind when you say, "I'm letting it stay"? Is it like, "If I let it stay, I'll be ruined" or "I'll lose control"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the story is something like, "If I let it stay, I'll lose control or they'll see I'm not normal and I'll be ruined." When that thought shows up my chest tightens and I just want to disappear. Can we slow down? This is getting really uncomfortable.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Noticing that thought and the tightening in your chest—it sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from being seen as "not normal." What if, for just a moment, you could notice that thought without trying to push it away or make room for it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I just noticed it for a moment maybe the racing would quiet a little and my chest would loosen. But it still feels like I'm inviting people to see the worst of me, and then I get really scared and want to back away. Can we slow down? I'm finding this really hard to stay with.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: You're trying to avoid being seen as the worst version of yourself because it feels scary. When you notice that fear showing up, what would it be like to make room for it, just for a moment, while you're still noticing your chest tightening and the racing thoughts?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I made a tiny bit of room for it, my chest might unclench a little and the thoughts would quiet for a moment. But then the warning voice would probably start saying I'm weak or ridiculous, and I'd feel like slipping away. Can we slow down? I'm getting really tangled up in this.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting stuck in the cycle of trying to push away the fear and the thoughts that come with it. What if, instead of trying to make room for the fear, you could try noticing it as it is—right now—as you're feeling the chest tightening and the thoughts racing.

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I tried to just notice it, it'd feel messy: my chest would stay tight, thoughts would keep racing and judging me, and I'd want to get up and leave. I'm trying to stay with it but it's really hard, so can we slow down? I'm getting quite anxious right now.


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Noticing that it feels messy and it's hard to stay with it—you're already doing that. It sounds like you're trying to stay with the discomfort, but it's like you're also holding onto the hope that you can make it go away. What if, instead of trying to make the mess go away, you could just notice it for a moment, even if it's hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I tried to notice it, it'd just feel like a messy knot: my chest stays tight and my thoughts keep flicking to the worst things, and I can't focus. I'm really on edge and kind of distracted right now, so can we slow down? I don't even know how to begin staying with it.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: The knot feels like it's already taking up space for you. When you notice that knot, what matters most to you right in that moment—is it just staying with the knot, or is there something else you want to be able to do with it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what matters is that the knot doesn't shove me out of the room, that I can stay long enough to feel normal with people. But I'm really on edge and distracted right now, my thoughts keep scattering, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really attached to staying with that feeling of being normal with people. What if, instead of trying to push the knot away, you could make room for it to be there while you're still trying to connect with others?

Patient: I don't know — I guess making room for the knot while trying to connect sounds... okay in theory, but right now my chest is tight and my thoughts keep scattering and I can't really picture doing both. Can we slow down? I'm having trouble focusing and it's making me more anxious.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: Noticing that the physical sensations and thoughts are making it hard to focus—that's already happening. When you notice that thought "I'm having trouble focusing," what happens to the knot in your chest right then?

Patient: I don't know — I guess the knot gets sharper and my chest squeezes, and everything else goes blurry so my thoughts just dart around and I can't hold on to anything. I'm really on edge and distracted right now, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: The knot getting sharper—it's like it's taking up more space. When you notice that, what's the smallest thing you could do to make room for it, even if just for a tiny moment, like noticing it as you breathe?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's just noticing it as I breathe supposed to help? I don't know, when I try that my mind just jumps and my chest feels tighter and I get even more distracted; I guess I can't picture even a tiny step right now. Can we slow down? I'm finding this confusing and hard to stick with.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: Noticing it as you breathe isn't meant to be a magical solution; it's just a tiny step to help you notice the knot while it's happening. When you try to picture a tiny step and it feels like it's not working, what would happen if you just noticed the knot for a tiny moment *right now*, without trying to make it go away?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I tried to notice it for a moment my chest would still be tight and my thoughts would just scatter and I'd probably start to panic. I'm not sure I follow how that helps; can we slow down? I'm really distracted and can't seem to stick with this right now.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Noticing the knot for a moment might feel like it doesn't help. What if, instead of trying to make the knot go away, you could just notice *what's happening with your chest* when you think about noticing it for a moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's noticing my chest supposed to help? I don't know, I guess when I try that the tightness feels louder, my breath gets shallow, and my thoughts just ricochet so I can't hold on to anything. I'm really on edge and distracted right now, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: Noticing your chest isn't about fixing the tightness. When you feel the breath getting shallow and thoughts ricocheting, what happens to your body when you *try to hold your breath* instead of letting it go?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to hold my breath my chest clamps down and I feel lightheaded, like I'm suffocating, and my thoughts just sprint away. I usually end up gasping and feeling embarrassed, like I couldn't even do that simple thing. Can we slow down? I'm really overwhelmed and confused and I can't see how that would help right now.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: Noticing your breath holding doesn't make sense when it feels like it's making things worse. What matters right now is how you're feeling when you *let go of trying to hold your breath*—not when you're holding it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. I guess if I let go of holding my breath my chest might ease a little and I could breathe more normally for a moment, but then my thoughts start sprinting and I feel even more out of control. I'm really on edge and distracted right now — can we slow down? I don't know how to keep doing this without feeling overwhelmed.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Letting go of holding your breath might make your chest ease a bit, but it sounds like it's hard to hold onto that small moment of ease when your thoughts are sprinting again. What matters most to you right now—is it that you *feel normal* with people, or is it something else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't know. I guess what's most important is not feeling like an outsider, being able to stay long enough that I don't lose people. But I'm really confused and distracted right now, my thoughts are skittering, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Noticing what matters most to you is a good start. When you feel like an outsider, what's the smallest part of you that might notice *you're there, in that moment, with others*—not just as someone who's "losing it" or being "left behind"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I guess there's this tiny part that's like a quiet wisp that wants to be seen, that hopes someone will just notice I'm there. But it's so faint that my chest tightens when I look for it and my thoughts immediately scatter. Can we slow down? I'm having trouble staying with this.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: The quiet wisp that wants to be seen—it sounds like it's worth noticing, even if it's hard to find. What would happen to that wisp *right now*, if you made room for it to be there *just for a moment*, without trying to hold onto it or make it bigger?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I made room for it the wisp might register for a moment and I'd feel a tiny bit steadier. But I'm really on edge and distracted right now, my chest's tight and my thoughts keep darting, so I can't really hold that image without the warning voice snapping back in. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: Noticing the warning voice—it sounds like it's trying to protect the wisp from getting hurt. What if, instead of trying to silence the warning voice, you could make room for the wisp to be there *just for a moment*, even if the voice shows up?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I tried to let the wisp be there with the warning voice, it might flicker for a moment and I'd feel a tiny steadier. But the warning voice usually jumps in, my chest tightens, and my thoughts just scatter so I can't really hold both. Can we slow down? I'm feeling really on edge and I don't know how to do this without getting overwhelmed.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the warning voice is showing up when you try to let the wisp be there. What if, instead of trying to stop the warning voice, you could notice it *right now*, as it's happening, without trying to push it away or make room for it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't know. If I tried to notice it right now the warning voice would feel louder, my chest would tighten and my thoughts would scatter, and I'd want to run. I'm really on edge and distracted, so can we slow down? I don't know how to notice it without it taking over.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: Noticing the warning voice while it's loud—your body is already trying to protect you from feeling that way. What matters most to you right in this moment—is there a tiny part of you that could stay with the warning voice, even if it feels like it's taking over?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't know. I guess the tiniest part that could stay is that quiet wisp that wants to be seen, but when the warning voice shows up my chest tightens, my thoughts scatter, and I just get more on edge. Can we slow down? I'm really distracted and I'm not sure how to stay with this right now.
