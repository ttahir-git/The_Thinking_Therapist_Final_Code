--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been stuck since that health scare — my head's turned into this fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster. I keep picturing myself failing at school, my partner getting tired of me and leaving, and everything spiraling out of control, and I can't seem to shake it. I'm sad, drained of motivation, and it's starting to wreck my relationship, but I can't imagine any other outcome.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that fortune-telling machine is really loud for you right now. When you say "I keep picturing myself failing at school, my partner getting tired of me and leaving," what happens in your body when you imagine that—like, where do you feel it in your chest or stomach?

Patient: My chest tightens like a vise and my breath gets so shallow I feel like I can't get enough air, and there's this hollow knot in my stomach. My hands go clammy and tremble, and I get dizzy and suddenly exhausted, like I can't face the day. When that happens the fortune-telling machine treats those sensations as proof everything's already collapsing, and I just start spiraling.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Those physical sensations sound really intense. It sounds like the fortune-telling machine is using them as evidence that things are going to go wrong, and that's making it hard for you to move forward. Can you notice what would happen to that knot in your stomach, that tightness in your chest, if you made room for just one tiny step towards your schoolwork, or talking to your partner about how you're feeling?

Patient: I try to imagine a tiny step, but the fortune-teller kicks in—if I tell my partner they'd get fed up and leave, then I’d fall apart, mess up at school, lose my job, and end up alone and sicker. When I picture that the knot in my stomach tightens and my breathing gets even shallower, like taking a step will only prove the worst is already happening. I know you're asking for something small, but honestly that chain of events feels like the only realistic outcome.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fortune-telling machine is really good at making you feel like taking action would be a huge risk. But what if, instead of trying to avoid the worst-case scenario, you could notice what would happen to that knot in your stomach if you didn't try to prevent it?

Patient: If I don't try to prevent it, the knot just twists tighter and my breathing shuts down and I freeze — and then the whole awful chain starts again: my partner gets fed up and leaves, the students notice I'm falling apart and I get written up or lose my job, and I end up alone and worse off health-wise. I know you're asking me to notice, but the fortune-teller in my head treats inaction as confirmation that the worst is already underway, so I can't picture it ever easing up.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that knot in your stomach is so connected to the worst-case scenario that when you try to imagine not doing anything, it just gets even tighter. What if, instead of trying to make that knot disappear, you could notice it while still making a tiny step towards talking to your partner?

Patient: I tried picturing saying something small to my partner, but the knot tightens and my hands start shaking the moment I think about it. The fortune-teller immediately says they'll get fed up, I'll blurt the wrong thing, they'll leave that night, I'll mess up at school from being distraught and lose my job — so it just feels impossible to take even that tiny step. I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't make myself see any other outcome.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that knot and the fortune-telling machine are really strong right now. When you say "I know that sounds dramatic, but I can't make myself see any other outcome," what would happen to the knot in your stomach if you could say to yourself, "I'm really scared that I'll mess up, but it's not because I'm going to lose my partner, it's because I'm worried about what might happen *while* I'm talking to them"?

Patient: When I try that it almost helps for a second, like the knot loosens just a hair, but then the fortune-teller gets louder and everything snaps back — my breath goes shallow, my hands start shaking, and I can already hear my partner's impatient sigh. I see myself stammering, them leaving that night, me falling apart at school, getting written up, and ending up alone and sicker. I know that sounds extreme, but it feels inevitable, and that feeling makes it impossible to actually say anything.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the knot is still there, even when it loosens for a second. That's really tough. When you say "it feels inevitable," what would happen if you could notice that thought *while* you were still trying to say something to your partner?

Patient: If I notice the thought while I'm talking, the knot just tightens and my words start tripping over each other — I can already hear the impatient sigh and see them storming out that night. I tell myself maybe that's not how it will go, but that feels like wishful thinking; I can't picture any outcome where it doesn't end with them leaving, me falling apart at school, and getting worse.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought while you're talking makes it even harder to speak. When you say "I know that sounds like wishful thinking," what would happen to the knot in your stomach if you didn't try to make that thought go away?

Patient: If I don't try to shove the thought away, the knot just sits there — hard and tight — and my breathing gets all clipped. Then the fortune-teller starts narrating: they'll get fed up and leave that night, I'll be a wreck at school, get written up, lose my job, and end up alone and sicker — I can't see any other ending. I know it sounds over the top, but my mind grabs onto that story and won't let go.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: The knot is still there, and the fortune-telling machine is still talking. It sounds like you're noticing what happens when you try to push that thought away, but when you stop trying, the knot doesn't disappear—it just stays. 

What matters is not that the knot goes away, but that you're willing to sit with it while you're trying to talk to your partner.

Patient: I want to, but sitting with that knot feels like pouring fuel on the fortune-teller — it just tightens and my words fall apart. I can already see them leaving that night and me falling apart at school, so I don't see how holding it would change anything.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like sitting with the knot feels like it would make things worse, not better. When you say "I don't see how holding it would change anything," what would happen to that knot if you could notice it while still taking one tiny step towards talking to your partner?

Patient: It just tightens and my breath cuts off, and if I force a tiny step I fumble my words, they sigh and leave that night — then I fall apart at school, get written up, lose my job, and end up alone and sicker. I know you're asking me to try, but honestly every time I imagine it I go blank and I can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is so connected to the worst-case scenario that even imagining taking a tiny step feels like it would fail. When you say "I don't see how holding it would change anything," what if holding the knot *while* you're trying to talk to your partner wasn't about changing the outcome, but about what matters to you while you're trying to talk to them?

Patient: Maybe that sounds okay in theory, but when I try it the knot just clamps down and my voice goes flat — I fumble a few words, they sigh and leave that night, I fall apart at school, get written up, lose my job, and end up worse and sicker. I want to focus on what matters while I talk, but the fortune-teller in my head feels so certain that taking that approach will only make it all come true.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really loud for you right now. When you say "I want to focus on what matters while I talk, but the fortune-teller in my head feels so certain that taking that approach will only make it all come true," what if you could notice the knot as it shows up *while* you're trying to talk to your partner?

Patient: When I try to notice it, it just collapses me—my words stumble, my breath clips, and I can already see them leaving that night, students whispering, me getting written up, losing my job, and ending up alone and sicker. I can't see how noticing it would help; everything feels heavy and fuzzy right now. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot feels like a weight that's hard to move. When you say "I feel heavy and fuzzy," what would happen to that knot if you could just notice it for one more moment, *without* trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I try to hold it for a second, but it just sits there, heavy and stone-like — my chest clamps, my breath gets shallow, and the fortune-teller fills the silence with them storming out and everything falling apart. I can't see it easing; it just feels like I'm stalling before the inevitable, and I don't have the energy to keep fighting that picture.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the knot as it shows up, even if it doesn't change. When you say "I don't have the energy to keep fighting that picture," what would happen to the knot if you could just *be* with it for one more moment, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I try to sit with it, but the knot just goes stone‑hard and my breaths get so short — the fortune-teller starts narrating them packing up that night, students whispering, a warning, me losing my job and getting sicker. I don't know how to keep holding this; it feels like I'm just delaying the collapse and I can't see any other outcome.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is feeling really unyielding for you. When you say "I don't know how to keep holding this; it feels like I'm just delaying the collapse," what matters to you right now, even if you can't see a way out of this knot?

Patient: What matters is not losing my partner, keeping my students' trust, and trying to hang on to my health somehow. But the fortune-teller immediately says that any move to protect those things will just make them happen — they'll leave, the students will notice and I'll get written up and lose my job, and I'll end up alone and sicker — and I don't know how to hold on to what matters without it feeling like I'm speeding toward that collapse.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really tied to the idea that protecting what matters means losing everything else. When you say "I don't know how to hold on to what matters without it feeling like I'm speeding toward that collapse," what if you could notice that knot as it talks to you about *not* losing your partner, *not* losing your students' trust, *not* losing your health, even if it feels like the fortune-teller is saying that those things are already gone?

Patient: I try to hear the knot say the “not losing” stuff, but the fortune-teller immediately blurts out them packing that night, students whispering, a write‑up, and me alone and sicker — the knot clamps so hard I can’t get enough air. I want to believe the other possibility, but it feels like pretending and makes everything worse, so I don’t know how to hold that without it turning true. Can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really loud for you right now. When you say "I want to believe the other possibility, but it feels like pretending and makes everything worse," what if you could notice that knot as it shows up *while* you're trying to hold onto the "not losing" possibility?

Patient: I try to hold both, but the knot just locks and my breaths get tiny — my voice goes flat and I can't get the words out. Even as I cling to the "not losing" thought, the fortune-teller yells they'll pack up that night, students will whisper and a write‑up will come, and I'll end up alone and sicker, so it feels useless. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really taking over. When you say "even as I cling to the 'not losing' thought, the fortune-teller yells they'll pack up that night," what would happen to the knot if you could just notice it *as a thought*—not as the truth, but as just a thought—right now, in this moment?

Patient: If I tell myself it's just a thought, the knot loosens for one breath—like I might actually manage to say one calm sentence to my partner—but then the fortune-teller screams that I'm kidding myself and the knot clamps down harder, and I can already see them packing and the students whispering. My chest goes tight and my voice thins, and it honestly feels like noticing it as "just a thought" just proves it's real; I want to try but my energy's nearly gone—can we slow down?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot as "just a thought" feels like a small step, but it's still hard to hold onto. When you say "I want to try but my energy's nearly gone," what would happen to the knot *while* you're willing to try one tiny step, even if it's just *one* calm sentence to your partner—just to see what matters matters, even if the knot is still there?

Patient: If I force that one calm sentence, it loosens the knot for one shaky breath—my voice goes thin and I get the words out—but the fortune-teller immediately yells they'll pack up that night, students will whisper and a write‑up will follow, I'll lose my job and end up sicker, and the knot slams shut like a trap. I want to try, but I'm running out of steam—can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really loud for you right now. When you say "I'm running out of steam," what matters to you right now *while* you're trying to push through that knot and get that one calm sentence out?

Patient: What matters is keeping my partner, keeping the students' trust, and hanging on to my health — I want to get out one calm, honest sentence so they know I'm trying. But the fortune-teller immediately says that even saying it will make them pack that night, the students will whisper and I'll be written up, and it all just rushes straight to collapse, so it feels pointless. I'm running on fumes and I don't know how to push through that picture.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really tied to the idea that if you try to get that one calm sentence out, everything else will fall apart anyway. When you say "I'm running on fumes and I don't know how to push through that picture," what would happen to the knot *if* you could just notice it *while* you're trying to get that one sentence out—*not* because you're worried it will make everything else happen, but because you want to see what matters matters, even if the knot is still there?

Patient: If I notice the knot while I try to say that one sentence it loosens for one shaky breath so the words come out, but then the fortune‑teller screams they'll pack that night, students will whisper, a write‑up will follow, and the knot slams shut harder. My energy's nearly gone and I can barely keep holding it—can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot while you try to say that sentence is helping for a moment, but it's still not working for you. When you say "my energy's nearly gone," what would happen to the knot *if* you could just *let go* of trying to push through it for one more moment—*not* because you want to make everything better, but because you want to see what matters matters, even if the knot is still there?

Patient: If I try to let go for a moment the knot just sits there, heavy and stone‑cold, and my breathing gets tiny — it doesn't feel like relief, it feels like surrendering to that fortune‑teller. Then it starts narrating them packing that night, students whispering and a write‑up, me losing the job and getting sicker and alone, so letting go feels like it's making it happen. I'm practically out of steam — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to let go of the knot is still tied up with the knot itself. When you say "it feels like surrendering to that fortune-teller," what would happen to the knot *if* you could notice it *as* the fortune-teller—*not* as the truth about what's happening, but just as the story that's showing up right now?

Patient: I try to call it a story, and for one breath the knot loosens like maybe it's not all true, but then that voice sneers that the story is proof and the knot slams shut — I can already see them packing and the students whispering. I can't keep the "just a story" without the fortune‑teller turning it into reality, so I feel stuck—can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot as a story is helping for a moment, but it's still hard to hold onto. When you say "I feel stuck," what matters to you right now *while* you're trying to figure out how to keep the knot from getting slammed shut—*not* because you want to make the knot disappear, but because you want to see what matters matters, even if the knot is still there?

Patient: What matters is keeping my partner, keeping the students' trust, and somehow not getting worse health-wise. But the fortune‑teller in my head says any step to hold those things will make them pack that night, the students will whisper and I'll get a write‑up, lose the job, and end up alone and sicker, so I can't picture another way. I'm running on fumes—can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the knot is really loud for you right now. When you say "any step to hold those things will make them pack that night," what would happen to the knot *if* you could just notice it *as* a prediction—*not* as the truth about what's going to happen, but just as a thought that's showing up right now?

Patient: If I call it a prediction it eases for one shaky breath — I can almost tell myself it's just a thought — but the fortune‑teller sneers that the prediction is proof and the knot slams shut and I can already see them packing that night, students whispering, the write‑up. I can't keep wrestling with that picture right now; can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to call the knot a prediction is helping for a moment, but it's still not working for you. When you say "I can't keep wrestling with that picture right now," what matters to you right now *right now*—*not* about the knot or the prediction, but about what you're willing to do next, even if it feels like you're not making progress?

Patient: Right now what matters is not losing my partner, keeping the students' trust, and trying not to get worse — so I'm willing to try one tiny thing: send a short, honest text to my partner saying I'm scared and ask if we can talk later, and maybe tell one trusted colleague that I'm struggling so they can cover if I need help. But the fortune-teller immediately snarls that the text will scare them off, the colleague will gossip, the students will notice, and it'll all spiral, and I'm so drained I can barely stand up to that story.
