Patient: Yeah... I've been totally burned out from the job and I've been drinking more after shifts just to shut my brain off. If I don't stop, it's gonna spiral — I'll mess up a job, get fired, lose my place, friends will drop me, and I'll definitely end up with nothing. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't shake the feeling it's how this is gonna play out.

Therapist: That sounds like a really tight, suffocating knot you're carrying around. When you say "I know that sounds extreme," what's happening when you notice that thought — like, what's the sensation in your body when it shows up?

Patient: My chest tightens like someone's squeezing it and my stomach drops — I get lightheaded and my hands start shaking. Then my brain just starts playing the worst-case movie: I mess up at work, get fired, lose my place, end up alone, and it feels so real I have to drink to quiet it. I can't really picture any other outcome; the panic and that story feed each other and it all feels inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like that knot in your chest and that worst-case movie are really connected. When you notice your hands shaking and your stomach dropping, what happens if you just *made room* for that feeling — not to change it, but just to notice it, like a faint hum in the background?

Patient: I try to, but the moment I notice it the movie just gets louder — my chest clamps down and my thoughts speed up into a disaster montage. I can tell myself to breathe, but then my brain starts predicting I'll mess up a lift, get fired, lose my place, end up alone, and it feels so real I have to drink to shut it off. I don't see any other ending; staying with the feeling just makes the story feel inevitable and impossible to sit with.

Therapist: So the moment you try to notice the knot, it feels like the story gets louder. That makes sense. What if, instead of trying to notice it, you could just *allow* that knot to be there — just for a moment, while you're looking at the worst-case movie? Not to change it, but just to see what would happen if you didn't try to push it away.

Patient: I tried that — letting the knot be just makes the movie louder, like I'm watching a trainwreck I can't stop. If I don't do something, it'll play out: I'll screw up a lift, get fired, lose my place, everyone's gone — it feels inevitable, and pretending it might turn out okay just seems unrealistic. I don't know how to sit with it; it feels like I'd be letting the disaster happen.

Therapist: So it feels like the story is playing out in front of you, and that's what matters most right now. What would happen to the knot, the movie, and the drinking if you just *made room* for that feeling of inevitability for 10 seconds? Not to change it, but just to notice it while you're looking at it.

Patient: If I try that, the knot just squeezes harder and the movie goes full blast — those ten seconds feel like an eternity and my hands tremble more, like I can already see myself screwing up a lift and getting fired. It makes the urge to drink spike because I can't stand watching that chain start; sitting with it feels like I'm letting the disaster happen, not preventing it.

Therapist: The ten seconds feel like an eternity, and the knot is squeezing harder. It sounds like you're trying to hold onto preventing the disaster, even though that feels like it's what matters most. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that, you could *let go* of the need to prevent it?

Patient: I can't — letting go feels like flipping a switch that starts the whole disaster. My chest clamps, the movie goes full force — I mess up a lift, get fired, lose my place — and the urge to drink hits so hard I feel like I have to do something.

Therapist: So letting go of preventing the disaster feels like it would actually *start* the chain reaction you're trying to avoid. It sounds like the urge to drink is really connected to that sense of being overwhelmed. When you feel that urge, what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there — not to drink, but just to notice it, like a faint hum in the background?

Patient: If I try to just let the urge be, it gets louder—my chest clamps, my hands shake, and my brain cranks the worst-case movie up on repeat. The panic spikes and it feels like I'm already screwing up a lift and getting fired, so the urge to drink turns into this urgent need or it'll all happen for sure. I can't see any other outcome; letting it sit there just feels like watching the disaster start and I don't know how to stay with that.

Therapist: It sounds like the urge to drink has become a way to try to push the worst-case scenario away, but that's not working. When you notice your chest clamping, hands shaking, and brain racing, what's one tiny thing you could do right now, just for a moment, to make room for that urge to be there?

Patient: I could try putting a hand on my chest and taking ten slow breaths or set a 10-second timer and just notice the urge. But honestly, I already picture that making the knot tighten and the disaster movie louder, and I'll still feel this huge push to drink — it feels pointless, but I could try it for ten seconds.

Therapist: It sounds like even small actions feel like they'll get overwhelmed by the worst-case scenario. What if, instead of trying to "make room" for the urge, you just did the tiny action anyway — put your hand on your chest, take ten slow breaths, or set the timer — without expecting it to change the knot or the movie?

Patient: Alright — I can try that: hand on my chest and ten slow breaths. I’m already bracing though, because the moment I notice it the movie cranks up, the knot squeezes harder, and the urge to drink hits like a freight train, so honestly it feels pointless — but I’ll try it for ten seconds even if it feels like forever.

Therapist: It sounds like the moment you start doing the action, the worst-case scenario kicks in. That's not about the action failing, but about noticing that the same story keeps showing up. When you feel that freight train of the urge to drink, what would happen if you just let it be there, even for just those ten seconds, while you're putting your hand on your chest and taking slow breaths?

Patient: Okay... I’ll try to let it be for those ten seconds while my hand’s on my chest and I breathe. But when I do, everything goes kind of flat and the movie just turns up — I can already see the lift slip, getting fired, losing my place, everyone gone — and the urge to drink hits like that freight train, so it feels almost impossible to just sit with it.

Therapist: It sounds like the action of putting your hand on your chest and taking slow breaths actually *frees up* the story for a moment, so you can notice the freight train of the urge to drink more clearly. What would happen if, instead of trying to stop the freight train or change the story, you just *allowed* it to be there while you breathed?

Patient: Yeah... I tried letting it be while I breathe, but the movie just cranks to full volume and my chest clamps — I can already see the lift slipping, me getting fired, losing my place, like if I don't drink it'll definitely happen. Letting it sit feels like watching the disaster start and I can't stand it. It's exhausting and I don't know how to stay with that without wanting to do something.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to noticing that the feeling of exhaustion is actually connected to the story of the disaster. When you feel like you can't stand watching it, what if you could just *notice* that feeling instead of trying to change it? Not to stop the disaster, but just to see what it would be like to be with that exhaustion while you breathe?

Patient: Okay... I'll try to notice the exhaustion while I breathe, but it just makes the disaster movie louder — my chest clamps, my hands tremble, and I can already see the lift slipping and everything falling apart. Noticing it doesn't help; it feels like I'm watching the chain start and the urge to drink becomes unbearable. I don't know how I'm supposed to stay with that — can you help me figure out what to actually do when it happens?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the exhaustion just made the story louder. What if, instead of trying to change the story or the exhaustion, you just *allowed* them to be there while you breathe? Not to stop the disaster, but to notice what would happen if you didn't try to fix it.

What would happen if, instead of trying to "stop" the disaster, you just *made room* for it to be there while you breathe? Not to let it happen, but to notice what would happen if you didn't try to change it.

What would you need to do right now, just for a moment, to make room for that exhaustion and the disaster story to be there without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try putting my hand on my chest, set a ten‑second timer, and breathe slow, but everything goes flat when I do and this shame just floods in. The worst‑case movie immediately spikes and the urge to drink hits like a freight train, so it still feels pointless. I don't know how to actually stay with it when that starts — can you walk me through exactly what to do in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're doing the action, but the shame and the story are still overwhelming. When the worst-case movie spikes and the urge to drink hits, I want you to notice what's happening in your body, just for a moment.

*Notice* the feeling of shame, not to change it, but to see what it would be like to notice it while you breathe.

And then, *notice* the freight train of the urge to drink, not to stop it, but to see what would happen if you didn't try to change it.

Now, I want you to do something small, just for 10 seconds, while you're noticing those feelings. *Place your hand on your chest* and *take one slow breath in*.

While you're holding that breath, *say to yourself* "I'm noticing the shame and the urge to drink, and it's still there."

Patient: Okay... (hand on chest, slow breath in) "I'm noticing the shame and the urge to drink, and it's still there." It gives me a tiny gap, then the shame floods back, my chest clamps, and the movie's already playing — screwing up a lift, getting fired, losing my place — the urge hits like that freight train and I don't know how to not ride it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the shame and the urge to drink again, and it's still feeling overwhelming. When the chest clamps and the movie starts playing, I want you to notice what's happening in your body, just for a moment.

*Notice* the feeling of the freight train, not to stop it, but to see what would happen if you didn't try to change it.

And then, *make room* for that feeling to be there, right now, while you're holding your breath. Not to let the freight train take over, but to notice what would happen if you didn't try to change it.

You've already noticed the shame and the urge to drink, and that's what matters. What's one small thing you could do with that feeling, even if the freight train is still there?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's that supposed to help? I guess one tiny thing I could actually do is set a 10‑second timer, put my hand on my chest and breathe, or step outside for a minute away from the booze. But honestly, it just feels like stalling the disaster — I don’t think it’ll stop the movie.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like the small actions aren't making a difference, and that's a really tough place to be.

Let's try something different. Instead of focusing on what you can do to stop the disaster, what if you just focused on what you can do to notice it while it's happening? Not to change it, but just to notice what's going on inside you.

You mentioned setting a 10-second timer and taking a step outside for a minute. What would happen to the disaster movie if you did that for just one minute, while you were doing it? Not to stop it, but just to notice what's happening while you're taking care of yourself.

Patient: If I actually did that for a minute, it would give me a tiny, stupid little pause — like the movie keeps playing but muffled. Then as soon as the minute's up, the movie slams back full volume: the lift slips, I get fired, lose my place, everyone's gone, and the urge to drink hits so hard I probably cave. It might feel like I survived a breath, but it doesn't change the ending — so I don't see how that helps me keep from doing it afterward. What am I supposed to do when that minute ends?

Therapist: It sounds like even the tiny pause you're hoping for doesn't feel like it's making a difference when the minute is up.

Let's try to think about what might be holding you back from noticing what matters right now, instead of getting caught up in the disaster movie. What if, instead of trying to stop the movie or change what happens after the minute is up, you just noticed what you need to do to keep showing up for yourself?

For example, what would it mean to you to keep putting your hand on your chest and taking slow breaths, even when the movie comes back on full volume? Not to stop the movie, but to notice what's happening in your body and mind when it matters most – like when you need to make a decision about getting a drink.

Patient: I guess it would mean I'm...trying, but it still feels pointless — like those breaths are just a short pause before the movie says I’ll botch the lift, get fired, lose my place. It makes me feel ashamed and useless, like I'm proving to myself I can't stop it without getting drunk, so when the decision comes I don't trust that tiny pause to matter.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-doubt are really tight around that tiny pause. When you notice that feeling, what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there, even for just a moment? Not to change it, but to see what matters to you right now.

You mentioned it feels pointless, but what if that feeling mattered? What if that shame and self-doubt actually told you something important about what you need to do to take care of yourself? Not to change the movie, but to notice what's happening in that moment when you need to make a decision.

Patient: Maybe that shame is just this loud signal that I'm terrified of failing and ending up alone — so what it "says" is I need someone with me after shifts, a real back‑up plan when the urge hits, or somewhere to go instead of drinking. But even saying that feels...flat and useless, like a bandaid — my brain still plays the movie and I don't trust any plan to stop the inevitable, so I don't know how to actually do it.

Therapist: It sounds like that shame is actually a signal that you're scared of losing connection with others, and that's what matters to you. When you notice that feeling, what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there, even if it feels flat and useless? Not to change it, but to see what matters to you right now.

You mentioned needing someone with you after shifts, a real back-up plan, or somewhere to go instead of drinking. What if, instead of trying to fix that feeling, you just *noticed* what it would be like to have someone there with you? Not to change the shame, but to see what it would be like to have a connection with someone that matters to you.

For example, what if, when the urge to drink hits, you could just *say* to yourself, "I'd really like some company right now" – not because it fixes the shame, but because it shows up to what matters to you?

Patient: I could try saying that, but the movie kicks in — I text someone and they don't answer or they blow me off, everyone thinks I'm a mess, I drink to cover the shame, screw up at work, and it's downhill from there. Asking just feels like signing a confession that I'm already failing, so it seems pointless. I don't know how to risk making that scene.

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is so tied up with the fear of being rejected that it feels like asking for help is the same as confessing to failure. When you notice that feeling, what would happen if you just *allowed* it to be there, even for just a moment? Not to change it, but to see what matters to you right now.

You mentioned that asking for help feels like signing a confession that you're already failing. What if, instead of trying to avoid that feeling, you just *noticed* what it would be like to have someone show up with you, even if it's just for a moment? Not to fix the shame, but to see what it would be like to have someone there with you.

For example, what if, when you text someone and they don't answer, you just *said* to yourself, "I'm not sure what to do right now, but I'd really like some space to figure it out" – not because it fixes the shame, but because it shows up to what matters to you?

Patient: I don't know—saying that to myself sounds okay on paper, but the second a text goes unanswered my chest sinks and that shame just floods in, and I can already see them laughing, me drinking, screwing up at work. It feels pointless, like a fake Band‑Aid, and I can't trust that line to stop the spiral. Can you give me real, exact steps to do in the moment when someone doesn't reply? I need something I can actually follow instead of guessing.

Therapist: I'm going to give you a specific, exact step to try in the moment when someone doesn't reply. This isn't about fixing the shame or changing the outcome, but about noticing what's happening in that moment.

When you feel that chest sinking and the shame flooding in, *right now*, take one small step with your hand: *lift your finger* to type one single word: "Wait." That's it. Just type "Wait" and hold the phone for one second. Then, *put the phone down* and step away from it for one second.

What matters to you is not what happens next, but what happens in that one second when you choose to wait.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try that — lift my finger, type "Wait," hold it for a second, then put the phone down. But I can already picture the whole thing: no reply, my chest drops, that shame floods back and I’ll be reaching for a drink while the disaster movie kicks off again. I’ll do it, but it feels like a useless little stunt against something that’s already decided.

Therapist: It sounds like you're already picturing the whole thing, and that's making it feel like a lost cause. But here's what matters: not the outcome, but the *choice* you're making in that moment.

When you put the phone down, you're not trying to change the shame or the disaster movie. You're just making room to notice what's happening in that moment, without judgment. It's not about winning or losing; it's about being present.

What if, instead of thinking "I'll do it, but it feels pointless," you just *trusted* that small step to be enough? Not to change the outcome, but to see what happens when you choose to wait, even when it feels like a tiny, useless act.

Patient: Maybe I can try to trust it, but I'm tired and honestly pretty skeptical. I can already see the whole thing: I type "Wait," no reply, my chest drops, shame floods back and I'll be reaching for a drink and the job messes up — feels inevitable. I'll try the step, but can you give me a very specific line to say to myself in that second so I don't just cave?

Therapist: It sounds like you're struggling with skepticism and feeling like you're stuck in a loop. When you put the phone down and type "Wait," what would it mean to you to *say* to yourself, just for a moment, "I'm here with my body"?

Patient: Okay... saying "I'm here with my body" gives a tiny gap — my chest eases for a breath — but then the movie slams back full force: the lift slips, I get fired, lose my place, everyone leaves, and I reach for a drink. It helps for a second but feels useless against the whole chain. Can you give me one exact, short sentence to say in that moment and the exact next physical thing to do (like put the phone down and go where, or hold what, or call who)? I need step‑by‑step stuff I can actually follow instead of guessing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that saying "I'm here with my body" gives you a tiny moment of ease. When you feel the movie slamming back in, what if you just *said* to yourself, "I'm here" — one single word — and then *put your hand on your chest*?

Patient: Okay... I tried saying "I'm here" and putting my hand on my chest. It eases for one shallow breath, then the movie blasts back — I already see the lift slip, getting fired, losing my place — shame floods and the urge to drink hits like a freight train. It gives a tiny beat but it's not enough; tell me one exact, concrete thing to do for the next 30 seconds when that freight train hits, something I can follow without thinking, because otherwise I know I'll cave.

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the momentary ease isn't lasting. When the freight train hits, what if you *just notice* the feeling of your feet on the ground, and then *slowly slide your chair back* about 6 inches away from the desk, *without moving your hands or looking away*?

Patient: Okay... I tried noticing my feet and slid the chair back like you said, but it just made the movie explode — my chest clamps, shame floods, my hands tremble, and I can already see the lift slipping and me getting fired while the urge to drink hits like that freight train. It gave a tiny beat, then I'm right back planning my own collapse. I need one exact, idiot‑proof thing to do for the next 30 seconds when that freight train hits — something physical and simple I can follow, because otherwise I'll cave.

Therapist: It sounds like the small step felt like a trigger. When the freight train hits, what if you *just pick up your phone* and type *one single word*: "Wait"?

Patient: I can try typing "Wait," but it already feels pointless — I can see it all: no reply, my chest drops, shame floods, I reach for a drink, mess up a lift, get fired, lose my place. I'll do it if you want, but honestly I need something concrete to do in the 30 seconds after or I know I'll cave.
