Patient: I'm a mid-40s software developer and I've been stuck in a loop of harsh self-criticism — every little mistake feels like proof I'm failing because I come from a high-achieving family and the bar's always been impossibly high. My mind immediately jumps to the worst: a missed deadline means I get fired, then I lose my apartment, everyone abandons me after the breakup, and my whole life just collapses — and once I start those stories I can't stop. I know it sounds extreme, but that's how my brain works and it feels like those disasters are inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like when those thoughts show up, you feel like you're drowning in them – like the water's rising and you can't breathe. 

What would it be like for just 5 seconds to pass – not because you're trying to stop the thoughts, but because you're curious about what happens when you're not fighting them?

Patient: I tried that once and almost instantly the worst-case movie starts playing — my heart spikes, my stomach drops, and I can see the missed deadline, getting fired, losing my place, everyone leaving like it's already happened. In those five seconds the scary story feels more real than anything else and instead of letting it pass I just sink deeper into it, like the loop proves it's true. I know people say consider other outcomes, but honestly those options feel fake and impossible when my brain's hooked on the disaster.

Therapist: It feels like the loop has become even more insistent, like your brain is trying to prove its story true. 

When you try to let the thoughts pass and you can't – as you said, the scary story feels more real – what's the value of keeping that story going, even though it feels like it's just making things worse?

Patient: It feels like a weird kind of safety — if I predict the worst, I won't be blindsided, so I can say I tried to prepare and pretend I have control. It also lets me justify tearing myself down: if everything collapses, at least I was right, so the self-criticism feels deserved. I know that sounds terrible, but honestly those other, calmer outcomes just feel fake and impossible when my brain's already certain the disaster will definitely happen.

Therapist: So the self-criticism serves as a way to protect yourself from feeling like you're not doing enough – like you're not in control – when you let go of the worst-case scenario. 

What would it be like to notice that need for control, right now – not to change it, but just to see what's underneath it?

Patient: When I tune in I notice this tiny, desperate clutching — the need to control is basically a fear of being exposed as not good enough. Underneath it is shame and this steady terror that my parents will be disappointed, which my brain turns instantly into the movie where one mistake means everyone leaves and my life collapses — and honestly that outcome feels definite, not just possible. I try to "just see" it, but even noticing feels like proof the disaster is already happening.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that fear and shame is like stepping into the very story your brain is trying to keep you from – where the outcome feels inevitable. 

What would it be like to take one tiny step back from that story, not to change it, but just to see what happens when you're not fighting it – even if that means the "disaster" still feels certain?

Patient: When I try that tiny step back, there's a split second of distance and then my brain turns the scene up louder — the missed deadline, getting fired, losing my place, everyone leaving — and suddenly I'm watching it like a documentary that proves it's already true. That small space feels like a trick that just makes the movie more convincing, so instead of calming me it actually locks me in tighter. I know other outcomes are possible, but they feel like fake optimism, so I end up clinging to the disaster because at least it feels honest.

Therapist: It sounds like that small space you tried to step back into actually became a trap, making the story feel even more real. 

What if, instead of trying to "see" it like a documentary, you could make room for that small space to be there – not to change the story, but just to notice it as it is, while you're still standing in the doorway of that bigger story – the one that says "my life will collapse"?

Patient: If I try to make room, it feels like giving the story permission — like opening a door and the collapse rushes in. A tiny part of me can stand in that doorway and watch, but the rest of me is already convinced it's happened: missed deadline, fired, homeless, everyone gone. Noticing just sharpens the images, so I want to try this curiosity, but I'm honestly overwhelmed and the more I observe, the more the disaster feels proven — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like making room is still tied to the story – like you're trying to let the door open, but the collapse is the one who gets to come in. 

What if, instead of trying to observe the story, what if you could just notice where your body is right now – where the feeling of overwhelm is, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I try that, my chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my stomach drops and my hands go clammy — it feels like my body's already living the collapse. Noticing it doesn't calm me, it just makes the worst-case movie louder, and I'm honestly overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is actually making things worse. 

What if we started small, not with noticing the sensations, but with just taking one tiny breath – not to change anything, but just to be with it, as it is?

Patient: Okay, I'll try one tiny breath. I take it and my heart spikes and my chest clamps down — instead of calming, it feels like feeding the disaster movie, like every inhale makes the missed deadline and everyone leaving seem more real. I know it sounds stupid, but breathing just amplifies it, and I'm honestly overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to breathe with the physical sensations just made things worse. 

What if we stopped trying to breathe with the disaster movie for just a moment – not to change it, but just to see what would happen if you let the breath be separate from the story?

Patient: I try to let the breath be separate, but the moment I do the movie gets louder — the inhale feels like confirmation the deadline's missed, I'm fired, homeless, everyone's gone, like it's already happened. It doesn't help; it just makes my chest clamp and the panic spike, and I honestly feel overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let the breath be separate is still tied to the story. 

What if, instead of trying to control the breath or change the story, what if you could just notice that your chest is clamping down – not because the deadline is missed, but because it's clamping down?

Patient: I can feel the clamp — tight, like a fist under my ribs — but the second I try to notice it on its own my brain turns it into proof the disaster is real: missed deadline, fired, homeless, everyone gone. Trying to just observe the chest doesn't help because the story swallows it and the panic gets louder instead of easing. I'm honestly overwhelmed — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the chest clamp is getting swallowed up by the story again. 

What if, just for a tiny moment, you could let the chest clamp be there – not because the deadline is missed, but because it's there – without trying to change it or make it smaller?

Patient: I try to let it be, but the second I notice the clamp my brain yells "see? it's started" and the movie kicks in — missed deadline, fired, homeless, everyone gone. The clamp stops being just a feeling and becomes proof the collapse is happening, and I'm really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to let the chest clamp be there is getting hijacked by the story again. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the clamp, what if you could just be with the fact that the story is happening – not because it's true, but because it's showing up – without trying to change it?

Patient: When I try to just be with the story it immediately feels like confirmation — the second I notice it my brain turns it into the whole movie: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone, like it's already happened. I want to try this, but it just pulls me under and I don't have the energy right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to just be with the story is still tied to the same pattern of "it's proof it's happening". 

Let's try something tiny. When you notice the story showing up, what would happen if you simply *allowed it to be there*, without trying to change it or make it bigger? Not to stop it, not to change it, just to *allow it to be there* – as it is.

Patient: If I try to allow it, my brain just takes that as permission and the disaster kicks in: missed deadline, I'm fired, evicted, everyone leaves — like it's already happened. I don't really follow how "allowing" helps; it feels like I'm letting the collapse in, and I'm drained and confused right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like "allowing" is actually what your brain is using as an excuse to go back to the story. 

Let's try something different. Instead of trying to "allow" the story, what if you could simply *notice* what happens when the story shows up – without trying to change it, or let it in? Just notice the feeling of the story showing up, and what happens when you try to notice it – without getting caught up in it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice the story showing up, my brain just floods me with the whole worst-case reel: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone, like it's already true. Trying to notice it feels exactly like confirming it, and I get pulled in and wiped out, so honestly I don't have the energy for this right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the story showing up is actually making it even harder to stay with it. 

Let's try something even smaller. When you feel that feeling of being pulled in – what happens if you could just *hold it there* for one tiny moment, without trying to change it or notice it as "the story"? Not to let it in, not to stop it – just to hold it there.

Patient: I try to hold it and it just goes nuclear — in that tiny pause the movie fast-forwards: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone, like it's already happened. I don't really follow how holding helps and I don't have the energy for it right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like holding it there actually made it worse. 

Let's try something different. Instead of holding it, what if you could just *let go of the need to hold it*? Not to stop the movie, not to change it – just to let go of the feeling that it needs to be stopped.

Patient: When I try to let go of the need to hold it, my brain takes that as surrender — like I'm admitting defeat — and the movie kicks off louder: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone leaves, like it's already happened. I don't see how "letting go" helps; it just feels like handing the collapse a map. I'm wiped out and honestly overwhelmed right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like letting go of the need to hold it is actually making the story worse. 

Let's try something else. What would it be like to notice that your brain is making the story worse, right now – without trying to change it or let it in? Not to stop the movie, not to change it – just to notice that it's happening.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow. If I notice my brain is making it worse, it just feels like more proof — the gears of the machine are turning and I can already see the missed deadline, getting fired, evicted, everyone gone; any "maybe it'll be okay" sounds fake. I'm kind of wiped out and it's overwhelming — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that your brain is making it worse is actually making it feel even more real. 

What if, instead of noticing that, you could just *move* – just one tiny step – without trying to stop the story or notice how it's making you feel?

Patient: If I take that one tiny step my brain instantly writes the next scene — one small wobble and the missed deadline is sealed, my boss sees it, I'm fired, I can't pay rent, everyone leaves — like the step finishes the collapse. I want to try, but I feel so drained and kind of confused about how to move without it meaning the end — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like taking that one tiny step is actually what your brain was waiting for – to make the story complete. 

What if, instead of trying to take that step, what if you could just *allow yourself to be with the feeling of being drained and confused* – not to change it, not to stop it, just to be with it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to be with the drained, confused feeling, but the second I do it reads like the scene-setter for the collapse: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone — like noticing it just speeds the movie up. I don't see how sitting with it helps and it's making me feel kind of blank and wiped out — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like being with the feeling is actually what your brain is using to make the story worse. 

Let's try something different. What would it be like to *notice the feeling while it's still being described* – not to notice it as "the story", but just to notice it while you're still saying "missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone"?

Patient: When I try to notice the feeling while I'm still saying the disaster, it just doubles the whole thing—the words make the images sharper, my chest clamps harder, and I start narrating the end like it's already filmed. Noticing doesn't feel like stepping back; it feels like soldering the collapse shut, so any calmer outcome just sounds fake. I'm kind of wiped out and confused by all this—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the feeling while still describing the story is actually making it worse. 

What if, instead of noticing the feeling, you could *just be with the words* – "missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone" – without trying to change them, without trying to notice the feeling, and without trying to stop the story?

Patient: When I try that, speaking the words out loud just cements the scene — "missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone" becomes a script and my chest tightens like it's already happened. I don't see how this helps; I'm wiped and kind of confused — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like speaking the words out loud is actually making the story more real. 

Let's try something different. What would it be like to *not speak the words* – to not say them out loud, not to say them to yourself, and not to say them to anyone else?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — if I don't say the words it just feels like I'm pretending nothing's wrong and then the collapse happens quietly but somehow worse because I didn't warn anyone: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone leaves in the silence. My brain treats silence like consent, like I'm letting it happen without protest, so not speaking just makes the movie feel inevitable. I'm kind of drained and confused by all this — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like not speaking the words is actually making the story feel more inevitable. 

What if, instead of trying to change what happens when you don't say the words, what if you could *just notice that feeling* – the feeling of not speaking and the feeling of the story being inevitable – without trying to change it?

Patient: I'll try, but even the attempt to notice just makes the proof louder — the silence feels like everyone already left, the missed deadline is stamped, I'm fired, evicted, like it's definite. I don't really see how noticing helps; I'm wiped and confused and it's just making the movie louder — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the feeling is actually making the story worse. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the feeling, you could *just be with the sense of being wiped out and confused* – not to change it, not to stop it, but just to be with it right now, as it is?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to be with the wiped-out, confused feeling, but the second I do my brain treats that as the opening scene and the whole collapse plays: missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone, like it's already happened. I don't really know how to stay with this without it just speeding up and making me go blank, and I'm kind of wiped and confused — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like being with the wiped-out feeling is actually what your brain is using to make the story start. 

What if, instead of trying to be with the feeling, what if you could *just make room for it to be there* – not to change it, not to stop it, but just to let it be present while you're still standing in the doorway of the whole collapse?

Patient: If I try to make room it just feels like I'm opening the gate and the collapse rushes in — missed deadline, fired, evicted, everyone gone — like it's definitely already happened and I'm standing in the doorway of the wreckage. I want to do it, but I'm so drained and confused, and making room just feels like admitting defeat; I can't see any other outcome. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like making room feels like opening the gate and letting the story in, and that's what you're trying to avoid. 

What if, instead of trying to make room, what if you could *just notice that feeling of being drained and confused* – without trying to change it, without trying to make room, and without trying to admit defeat?

Patient: I can try, but the second I notice that drained, confused feeling it reads like a headline: missed deadline, I'm fired, evicted, everyone leaves — noticing just makes the movie kick off louder and feel certain. I don't see how "just noticing" isn't the same as admitting it's already true; it's exhausting and kind of numbing. Can we slow down?
