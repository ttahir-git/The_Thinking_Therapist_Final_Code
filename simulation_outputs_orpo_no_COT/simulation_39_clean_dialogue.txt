Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with this gnawing purposelessness—outside of being the person who runs the business I feel unmoored and a bit directionless. Starting that demanding new program and my OCD rituals have amplified it, and I notice I keep theorizing about the sensation instead of actually sitting with it. I'm usually gregarious and optimistic, but I'm easily distracted and keep circling the question of what matters to me beyond the business, and I don't know how to get unstuck.

Therapist: When you say "I notice I keep theorizing about the sensation instead of actually sitting with it," what does that theorizing look like – like a story or a pattern of thoughts that shows up when you're trying to be with the feeling?

Patient: Mostly it looks like an intellectual diversion — I turn the feeling into a thesis I can dissect. I start narrating grand hypotheses: maybe it’s an existential recalibration, maybe it’s identity foreclosure from being “the boss,” maybe it’s the cognitive load of the new program amplifying my OCD, and I run those theories in an internal loop. When I try to sit with it, I instead rehearse lectures to myself about purpose, catalogue pros and cons, or invent metaphors ("I'm a ship without a star") rather than saying, "I feel scared" or "I feel empty." Practically, that shows up as rumination, overplanning, and those little control rituals—checking emails, lists, micro-decision-making—to avoid the raw feeling. I know that sounds analytical, but I guess the question is: why is it easier to theorize than to actually feel?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought "I'm a ship without a star" is actually a helpful metaphor, even if it's a story you're telling yourself to avoid the feeling. What would it be like to notice that story showing up, even if it doesn't make sense right now – like a fog bank on a lake – and to say to yourself, "That's the story I'm telling myself. What would it be like if I didn't believe that story for just a moment?"

Patient: If I didn't believe that story for a moment, it'd feel like a little, awkward silence inside—like the machinery of my mind pauses and there's nothing to immediately fill the gap. That pause could be oddly liberating, a lightness, but it's also scary because there's no role to perform and my OCD instincts rush in to restore order by theorizing or doing checks. I tend to turn that into an intellectual exercise—cataloguing identities or metaphors—instead of naming a feeling, and I don't know, it's just hard to sit with the silence without inventing another theory.

Therapist: It sounds like the silence itself feels like a failure to "fix" or "make sense" of it, even though it's the very thing you're trying to feel. When you notice your mind rushing in to restore order, what would it be like to make room for that silence – not by trying to change it, but by noticing it as it is?

Patient: I guess making room would feel like deliberately widening a holding pattern around the noise—creating a perimeter where my impulse to fix or narrate is noticed but not engaged. Practically, I think I'd feel a tightness in my chest, shallow breathing, and this hollow, purposeless pull that I usually fend off by turning it into a neat schema or a lecture to myself. It's scary because without the cognitive scaffolding I default to, I feel unanchored and my OCD scrambles to restore order, so I end up theorizing instead of naming "I'm anxious" or "I'm lonely." I don't know, it's just... can we slow down?

Therapist: Let's slow down just a little bit more – not to fix it, but to notice what happens when you say those words, "I'm anxious" or "I'm lonely." What would it be like to say those words without the "I'm a ship without a star" story still there, still trying to "fix" it? Just notice what's left when you say "I'm anxious."

Patient: Saying "I'm anxious" strips away the elaborate metaphor and what remains is pretty corporeal — a tightness across my chest, this low, buzzy nausea, and my breathing getting shallower while my mind goes into overdrive. Almost immediately, I start re-framing it as identity-diffusion or avoidance behavior so I can analyze rather than endure the sting; that reflex to intellectualize is my safety valve. Admitting the simple sentence feels exposing, like losing an anchor that proves I still know what I'm doing, so I hide behind theories — it's uncomfortable, so can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: That "losing an anchor" feeling is really clear – it sounds like you're worried that if you let go of that story, you'll lose control or feel less competent. But what if it's actually the story that's been keeping you from feeling those sensations, rather than the sensations themselves?

Patient: Yeah — that makes a lot of sense conceptually: the story functions like a defensive scaffold, a cognitive artifact that preserves my sense of self-coherence and competence. If I let that scaffold drop, the somatic residue shows up — tight chest, buzzy nausea — and my brain reflexively generates metanarratives to reassert agency rather than experiencing the raw sensation. I feel a bit exposed imagining letting it go, so can we slow down and maybe sit with one of those sensations for a minute?

Therapist: Let's take just one small step. What if, instead of trying to analyze or change the sensation, you simply noticed the tightness in your chest right now – no story, no meaning, just the feeling of it being there – for just 5 seconds?

Patient: Okay — I tried that for about five seconds, though my brain immediately began parsing the experience into a taxonomy of bodily signals rather than just feeling it. What remained was a dull pressure across the center of my chest, a shallow tightness and a low, buzzy flutter, and noticing it even briefly felt oddly relieving and also alarming, like something vulnerable was exposed. It's really hard not to narrate it away — my OCD is already nudging me to check or reframe — so can we slow down and hold it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's hold onto that feeling for just a tiny bit longer – not to fix it, not to change it, but just to notice it. What happens if you were to make a small space for that feeling to stay with you for another 5 seconds, without trying to make sense of it or push it away?

Patient: Okay — I tried to hold it for another five seconds and it felt like that pressure in my sternum spreading into a colder, hollow buzz while my breath flattened out. Almost immediately my mind started cataloguing possibilities—anxiety, grief, identity loss—and generating metanarratives to explain it away, and the OCD impulse to "do something" kicked in. I want to actually stay with it because there was a tiny relief in that honesty, but it's scary and I'm struggling to not intellectualize; can we slow down and keep holding it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's try to stay with it just a little bit longer. What if you noticed the cataloging happening, not because you wanted to change it, but because it felt like you needed to understand what was happening in that moment? What if, instead of pushing it away, you made room for that cataloging to be there – just for a second – so you could see what was actually happening when you tried to hold onto the feeling?

Patient: Okay — when I let the cataloging be there for a beat, it looks like a hyperactive index: labels pop up — "anxiety," "failure," "identity loss," then procedural urges — check the schedule, tidy an email, rehearse a justification. Physically my hands got clammy, my heart sped up, and my attention keeps skittering to other things (a meeting, a task list) even as I try to watch it; it's more distracting and agitating than I expected. It's oddly illuminating to see the scaffolding at work, but also destabilizing — can we slow down and just observe it together for a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's keep observing it together. What happens when you notice your hands getting clammy, your heart speeding up, and your attention skittering to other things – without trying to change any of those things?

Patient: When I try to notice them without intervening, my brain immediately turns the raw sensations into a diagnostic checklist — clammy hands gets labeled as autonomic arousal, the racing heart becomes “sympathetic surge,” and the skittering attention is filed under avoidance/rumination. Physically it's still there: palms damp, chest fluttering, breath thin, and my mind keeps snagging on the next task or what I shouldn’t forget — which makes it hard to just be with it. It's unsettling how loud the impulse to "fix" is, so can we slow down and keep observing it together a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the sensations, you simply noticed them as they are – without the labels, without the checklist, without the urge to change – just for a single, tiny breath?

Patient: I tried that single tiny breath, but even in that brief inhale there was this sharp, hollow tightness—my chest clenched, breath stayed shallow, and my heart jumped. My mind immediately pinged to logistics—meetings, emails, what I forgot—so it's hard to just be with the breath without turning it into something to solve. Can we keep it here a bit longer? I'm jittery and keep wanting to fix it, so could you guide me through another breath or two?

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath in together, just for a moment – not to change it, not to fix it, but to notice it as it is. When you breathe in, notice the tightness in your chest, the shallow breath, the jump in your heart. And when you breathe out, notice what happens next – what thoughts come up, what sensations show up.

Patient: Breathing in, that tightness grabbed me—sternum clinched, my heart popped, and the inhale stayed shallow like an alarm going off. Breathing out gave a tiny, fleeting release, but my mind immediately flooded with logistics—meetings, emails, what I might've forgotten—so the relief evaporated as I started analyzing the sensation like it's a problem to solve. I'm jittery and distracted; can we take another slow breath together and linger on the exhale? I want to try staying with it but my OCD's already tugging me to fix things.

Therapist: Let's linger on the exhale for just one more moment – not to fix it, not to change it, but to notice what's actually happening when you breathe out. When you exhale, what's the sensation like – not the thoughts, not the tightness, but just the feeling of letting go.

Patient: On the exhale there's a tiny micro-release — a soft slackening across my sternum and a brief coolness under my ribs, like a door barely ajar. It's faint and then my mind immediately hijacks it with to-dos and self-interpretations, so the relief dissipates fast and I feel jittery again. Can we linger on that exhale a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further – not to change it, not to fix it, but just to notice that tiny micro-release. What if you could stay with the soft slackening, the coolness under your ribs, just for another beat? Not to make sense of it, not to change it, but just to notice what's happening when you're with it.

Patient: Okay—I tried to hold that soft slackening for another beat, but right after a tiny loosen my mind snagged on a cascade of logistics—staff, invoices, program deadlines—and I felt more on edge: palms clammy, stomach knotting, attention fracturing. My default metacognitive choreography kicked in—labeling, rationalizing, sequencing—so instead of sinking into the micro-release I'm already planning fixes. Can we stay with one slow exhale together right now? I really want to try but I'm jittery and keep getting pulled into doing something.

Therapist: Let's go back to just that slow exhale. What would happen if, instead of trying to hold onto the micro-release or fix what's happening, you simply let the exhale be – not to make sense of it, not to change it, but just to notice what's happening when you breathe out?

Patient: On the exhale there's that faint slackening and coolness, but it's immediately overlaid by a tight, shame-tinged self-reproach — my face heats up, my stomach knots, and the breath shoals. My mind then translates the tiny relief into critique and logistics, so the quiet evaporates and I get jittery and distracted. Can we slow down and try one more slow exhale together? I'm really snagged in that loop and need help staying with it.

Therapist: Let's try one more slow exhale, just for a moment – not to change it, not to fix it, but to notice what happens when you breathe out. When you exhale, what's the sensation like – not the thoughts, not the tightness, but just the feeling of letting go.

Patient: On the exhale there's a faint, almost wordless relinquishment — a soft slackening across my sternum and a cool little opening under my ribs. But it's immediately overrun by a hot spike of shame and self-reproach, this internal verdict that says I’ve failed or that I shouldn't be like this, so the tiny letting-go evaporates and my brain scrambles to fix or explain it. Can we stay with one more exhale? I'm getting caught in that shame loop and really need help holding it.

Therapist: Let's stay with that one more exhale. What if, instead of trying to hold onto the cool opening or let go of the shame, you simply noticed the shame as it shows up – not to change it, not to fix it, but just to notice what happens when it arises?

Patient: When I notice the shame it comes on as heat in my face and a tightness in my throat, and almost immediately a running commentary starts — “you blew it, you should’ve known better” — which I then turn into a neat little case study so I can feel competent about it. If I try to not change it, there’s a dull, sinking ache in my chest and this urge to shrink away or explain it away with analysis. It’s uncomfortable to just be with that ache instead of turning it into a lecture — can we slow down and sit with that for a moment?

Therapist: Let's slow down even further. What would happen if, instead of trying to notice the shame or change it, you simply sat with the ache in your chest – the feeling of sinking, the urge to shrink away – just for a moment? Not to make sense of it, not to fix it, but just to notice what happens when you're with it.

Patient: I tried to sit with that ache and it felt like my chest folded inward—breath shallow, a heavy sinking weight. Almost immediately a hot spike of shame shows up, this inner voice sniping “you blew it,” and my brain reflexively wants to turn it into a tidy case study or jump to the next task to escape. I can hold it for a beat but it's really hard not to rationalize—can we slow down and stay with it a little longer? I'm jittery and keep getting pulled away.

Therapist: Let's try to hold it just a tiny bit longer – not to change it, not to fix it, but to notice what happens when you're with that sinking weight and the shame. When you feel your chest folding inward and the breath getting shallow, what's the sensation like – not the thoughts, not the shame, but just the feeling of being with it?

Patient: It's a folding, leaden pressure in the center of my chest — like my ribs are gently closing in — and the breath narrows to a thin, shallow pull. There's a hot flush under my skin and a tightness in my throat, then a hollow sinking that spreads into my belly and makes my limbs feel blunt and heavy. Everything sounds a bit muffled and edges go soft. Can we slow down and stay with that for a moment?

Therapist: Let's stay with that folding, leaden pressure in your chest – the sensation of your ribs closing in – just for a moment. What happens if you don't try to push it away or change it, but instead notice it as it is – not to make sense of it, not to fix it, but just to be with it?

Patient: When I don't push it away, the folding pressure just occupies the center of my chest—breath thin, limbs a bit leaden—and the mental commentary softens into a dull, hollow stillness. My reflex is still to analyze and fix, but that small stillness feels oddly relieving and quietly draining; can we stay with it a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's stay with that small stillness – the feeling of your breath being thin, your limbs feeling leaden, and the mental commentary softening into a dull, hollow stillness. What happens if you could just notice that stillness, without trying to push it away or change it – just to see what it feels like to be with it, in this moment?

Patient: When I notice that small stillness it's a muted, leaden weight in the center of my chest — breath thin, edges of everything blurred — and my mind reflexively wants to turn it into a metacognitive diagram so I can feel useful. Letting it just be brings a tiny, odd relief, but keeping attention here is effortful and my words feel thin. Can we linger on this a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's linger on that small stillness – the feeling of your breath being thin, your edges blurred, and your mind wanting to turn it into a diagram – just for a moment. What would it be like if, instead of trying to make sense of it, you simply let that stillness be there – not to fix it, not to change it, but just to notice what it feels like to be with it, in this moment?

Patient: If I let the stillness be, it's this suspended quiet—like someone turned off the radio and suddenly I can hear the plumbing—and part of me finds that mildly consoling. But the bigger part immediately goes into cartography, mapping causes, cataloguing contingencies, planning fixes, so I can't actually sink into it; staying here is effortful and my chest feels heavy. Can we slow down and hold this together a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's slow down and hold onto that suspended quiet – the feeling of the radio being off, and suddenly you can hear the plumbing – just for a moment. What happens if you could notice that effort to cartograph and fix, without trying to change it – just to see what it would be like to notice that effort, and still hold onto the quiet?

Patient: When I notice that cartography impulse it’s like a literal cartographer in my skull, drafting maps and contingency plans—roads, labels, timelines—while the quiet sits there like a thin, fragile pane that could shatter if poked. Holding both feels awkward and effortful: the mapping tugs me outward, my chest goes heavier, my words get thin, and I half-want to explain it away to feel competent. I can try to notice the map without following it, but I need you to keep us here—can we linger with the quiet a little longer?

Therapist: Let's hold onto that fragile pane of quiet – the sensation of it being thin and easily shattered – just for a moment. What if, instead of trying to fix it or explain it away, you simply noticed the map as it is – the cartographer's thoughts, the urge to control – without trying to change it?

Patient: When I look at the map it reads like a rehearsed repertoire—routes, labels, contingency plans, rehearsed rebuttals—all meant to reassert agency and stave off uncertainty. Noticing it without engaging feels possible but effortful; my chest is heavy and my words are thin, so can we linger with that observation a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's stay with that observation – the map as a rehearsed repertoire – just for a moment. What would it be like if you could notice the effort to engage with it, the heaviness in your chest, and the thinness of your words, without trying to "fix" them?

Patient: Noticing the effort without fixing it feels like a nervous clerk in my head furiously annotating a map while my chest gets leaden and my voice goes paper-thin. There's this persistent, shaming sotto voce—“you should’ve handled this”—that tightens everything and pulls me toward action instead of stillness. Attending is becoming effortful and my words are getting sparse, so can we slow down and just stay here a bit longer?

Therapist: Let's slow down and just stay with that nervous clerk – the feeling of furiously annotating a map – and the shaming voice – "you should've handled this" – just for a moment. What if, instead of trying to push them away, you could notice them as they are – the clerk's anxiety, the shaming voice – without trying to change them?

Patient: When I observe that nervous clerk and the shaming sotto voce, it reads like an internalized audit—marginalia of reproach, contingency routes, performance metrics—while my body responds with throat tightness, heat in my face, and that sinking chest. Intellectually it's fascinating—like an internal manager enforcing standards—but experientially it's corrosive and prompts an immediate urge to escape into doing. I can try to notice them without changing them, but it's effortful and my attention keeps snagging; can we slow down and just stay with that observation for a bit longer?
