--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I’ve been stuck worrying all the time about how I’m doing at school — like every lesson or observation feels like it could expose me. It’s made me procrastinate a lot; I put off planning or grading because I’m afraid it won’t be good enough. I don’t know, I guess I just feel kind of alone in it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on that worry about how you're doing at school. What would happen to that feeling of being alone if you were to take one small step toward planning a lesson or grading – even if it didn't turn out perfectly?

Patient: I don't know. I guess maybe I'd feel a little less alone, like I actually did something instead of just ruminating. But even thinking about starting makes me freeze — I keep imagining it will be awful. Can we... maybe talk about one tiny, tiny step that feels doable?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fear of the imagined outcome is really holding you back. What if, instead of trying to make the outcome perfect, you just made room for the possibility that you might be able to get through it – even if it felt hard?

Patient: I don't know. I guess that could make it less terrifying, but the idea of actually starting feels like this huge hurdle. Maybe a tiny step — like just 10 minutes of planning with a timer and no pressure to finish — could be doable? I don't know, does that sound realistic?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: Setting a timer for 10 minutes and committing to just that small step feels like a tiny, achievable thing. What would it mean for you to take that one minute, and then the next, and then the next – even if the bigger task still felt overwhelming?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it would mean I'm actually starting instead of just spinning — maybe I'd feel a little less stuck. But I'm also scared it'll just end up reminding me I didn't do enough once the timer stops, and then I'll feel worse. Can we... talk about what to do when that guilt kicks in?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the timer itself isn't the problem – it's what happens when you stop using it that matters. What if, instead of waiting for the timer to stop, you just noticed the thought "I didn't do enough" showing up while the timer was still on?

Patient: I don't know. I guess if that thought shows up while the timer's on I'll either freeze up and stare at the page or quit early because it feels pointless. Can you give me a concrete thing to do in that moment? I usually just get stuck and don't know how to move.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: When that thought shows up while the timer's on, what if you just made room for it – without trying to push it away or make sense of it – and then *wrote down* exactly what you were worried about doing "pointless"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I'd write stuff like "I didn't explain it well," "they won't pay attention," "they'll think I'm incompetent," or "I'll waste my time and it won't matter." It feels really uncomfortable to say that out loud — can you help me figure out what to do after I write those down?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already doing something valuable by acknowledging those thoughts – making space for them to be present. What if, after writing them down, you *closed the notebook* and went back to the timer, without trying to fix or make sense of those thoughts?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I could try closing the notebook and going back — it sounds less exhausting than arguing with the thoughts. But I'm really nervous that when the timer ends I'll just feel guilty and beat myself up. What would I do then?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that the timer ending would mean the hard work stops, but what if, instead of waiting for the timer to stop, you just *made room to move forward* – one tiny step at a time?

Patient: I don't know. I guess it might help if the next tiny step is already decided before the timer ends—like "when the bell goes, I add one bullet point" or "I set another 5-minute timer," so I don't have to decide in the moment. I'm still scared it'll feel like cheating or not enough, though—can we pick one concrete follow-up I can actually promise to do?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having a clear plan for what comes next after the timer goes off could help. What if, when the timer ends, you simply *pulled out your notebook and wrote down the next task* – not thinking about whether it's "enough" or not, just making space for the next step?

Patient: I don't know. I guess that could help — like deciding ahead that the next thing will be “write one learning objective” or “add one bullet point.” But I'm already nervous it'll still feel pointless and I'll beat myself up. Can we pick one super-tiny thing together now that actually feels doable?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: Let's start with something ridiculously small: what if, right now, you *just wrote down the word "start" on a piece of paper*?

Patient: I don't know. I guess... okay, I wrote "start"—it felt kind of dumb but also a tiny bit relieving. Now I'm already getting this doubt like "was that pointless?" and I don't know what to do next.


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that same doubt again – even after taking that tiny step. What if, instead of trying to push it away or make sense of it, you *made room for it to be there* – like noticing the thought showing up while you wrote "start"?

Patient: I don't know. I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing the doubt supposed to help? When I notice it I just freeze up and it feels like paying attention to it will make it worse.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: When you notice that doubt showing up while you wrote "start", what if *you didn't try to change it, but instead just *said "doubt" to yourself* – as if you were noticing a bird flying outside your window?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I tried saying "doubt" to myself when I wrote "start" and it felt weird — like it made the feeling a tiny bit smaller for a second, but then I just started thinking about all the ways I could mess up. Can we... maybe do something concrete for what comes next after naming it? I'm not sure how to use that in the moment without spiraling.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Let's try something small: when you notice that doubt showing up while you're trying to write something – *noticing it* – what if, right after that thought comes up, you *pick up your pen and write the word "keep going"*?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try writing "keep going" when the doubt shows up, but I'm already imagining it feeling fake and me quitting after a minute. If that happens, can we figure out a tiny fallback together? I'm worried I'll just spiral and then feel worse.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about how you'll feel if you try to write "keep going" and it doesn't feel real. What if, instead of trying to make it feel real, you *just did it anyway* – wrote "keep going" even if it felt like you were just going through the motion? And then, when you notice that doubt showing up, what if you allowed it to be there *while you were still writing*?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try writing "keep going" even if it feels fake, but I'm already nervous it'll just make me quit. If I do quit, can we pick a tiny fallback now—like another 2-minute timer or just writing one bullet point—so I don't spiral into feeling useless?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like having a small plan for when you do quit would help. What if, right now, you *promised yourself to write "keep going" for just 1 minute* – not thinking about whether it feels real or not, just doing it for 1 minute?

Patient: I don't know. I guess... okay, I'll try to write "keep going" for one minute — it already feels heavy just saying that. If I stop, can we have a fallback? Maybe a 2-minute timer or just writing one tiny bullet point so I don't spiral.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to take a small step. What if, when you start writing "keep going", you *set a timer for 1 minute* – not to make it perfect, just to make it real – and then, when the timer goes off, you *write down one tiny bullet point* – something as small as "I made progress" or "I tried" – without thinking about whether it's good or bad?

Patient: I don't know. Okay — I'll try the 1-minute thing: set a timer and write "keep going" even if it feels fake. It already feels like a lot, though. If I stop, can we fall back to the 2-minute timer and then I just write one bullet that says "I tried"?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've got a plan that feels doable. What if, when the timer goes off, *you just wrote "I tried"* – without thinking about whether it's good or bad – and then you *set another 2-minute timer*?

Patient: I don't know. Okay, I’ll try — when the timer goes off I’ll write “I tried” and then set a 2‑minute timer to add one tiny bullet, like “I made progress.” It already feels really heavy and I’m scared I’ll stop — if that happens, can the fallback just be setting one 2‑minute timer and writing that single bullet so I don’t spiral?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've got a plan that's helping you feel a little more manageable. When you set that next 2-minute timer, what if *you just showed up* – not thinking about whether you're "doing it right" or not – and *wrote down that single bullet point* "I made progress"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try to just show up and write "I made progress"—it feels really small and already my head's saying it's meaningless. If I freeze, can the fallback just be that 2‑minute timer and writing "I tried"?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that small voice again. What if, when you feel that freeze, *you just acknowledged the thought* – "That's my head saying it's meaningless" – and *you still chose to write down that single bullet point* "I made progress"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try to notice the voice and tell myself "that's my head saying it's meaningless"… but when I freeze it really locks me up and I can't make myself write. It feels like a lot right now. If that happens, can the fallback just be the 2‑minute timer and me writing "I tried" so I don't spiral?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to making a choice. When you feel that freeze, what if *you just *made room* for it – not to push it away, but to *be with it* – and *then* made the small choice to write down "I made progress" anyway?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try to make room for the freeze and then write "I made progress," but I'm really worried it'll feel fake and I'll just stare at the page. Can you give me a one- or two-sentence script I can say to myself right before I try, so I don't get stuck deciding what to do in the moment?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: When you feel that freeze, you can say to yourself: "I'm not choosing to write because it's'real' – I'm choosing to write because it matters to me."

Patient: I don't know. I guess that line kind of helps, but it already feels a bit clunky in my head. Maybe something shorter would work better in the moment — like, "I'm doing this for me" — can we try saying that once together so I don't feel ridiculous?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: When you say that to yourself, "I'm doing this for me," what's the small step that comes next – writing down "I made progress"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess the next small step is to say "I'm doing this for me" and then immediately write "I made progress" — even if it feels fake. If I freeze, can I just fall back to the 2‑minute timer and write "I tried"?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. When you say "I'm doing this for me" and write "I made progress", what matters most to you about that small step – not whether it feels real or not, but what it means for you?

Patient: I don't know. I guess what matters is that it's proof to myself that I can move forward even when I'm scared and unsure — that the worry doesn't have to stop me every time. It feels like a tiny permission to be imperfect, and maybe that would make the next thing a little less terrifying.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're recognizing that this small step isn't just about the outcome, but about what it means for your relationship with that worry – and what it means to show up with it anyway.

Patient: I don't know. I guess that does make sense — like it could be permission to be imperfect, but it also makes me anxious because it feels like I'd actually have to face the stuff I avoid. Can we slow down a bit? I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed and not sure how to make this stick.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the desire for permission to be imperfect is tangled with the anxiety of facing what you avoid. What if, instead of trying to make that stick, you just *allowed yourself to be with the feeling of overwhelm* – not to push it away, but just to notice it as it is, while you still made the small choice to write "I made progress"?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I can try to notice the overwhelm, but it already feels like a heavy weight and I'm scared I'll just freeze. Could you stay with me and guide me through one tiny try—like tell me when to breathe and when to write "I made progress"—so I don't have to decide in the moment?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: I'll stay with you. When you feel that overwhelm and the weight of it, *just notice it for one second* – that's the moment I want you to breathe in deeply *and hold it for a count of 4*. When you're ready, that's when you'll make the small choice to write "I made progress".

Patient: I don't know. I guess... okay, I'll try, but it already feels heavy. Can you actually count me in and tell me when to breathe and when to write "I made progress"? I'm worried I'll freeze otherwise.
