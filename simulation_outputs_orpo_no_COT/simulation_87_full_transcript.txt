--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a chef and lately I can't stop spiraling — one tiny mistake at work turns in my head into this guaranteed chain reaction: I lose shifts, lose my place to live, and end up alone like my past relationships. My mind treats those worst-case scenarios like facts, and when people say things could turn out okay I just dismiss that as unrealistic. It's eating at my confidence and making it impossible to move forward.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like those worst-case scenarios feel like they're not just possibilities, but already happening – even before you've made that one tiny mistake. Can you notice what happens when you try to hold onto that certainty: what does your body feel like when you imagine all those things falling apart?

Patient: My chest gets tight and my heart starts pounding, my stomach knots and I get this hot flush like I can't breathe right. Then my head just fills with the whole disaster script — losing shifts, getting kicked out, ending up alone like before — and I can't focus on anything else. I'm already feeling overwhelmed by picturing it, and I don't know how to make it stop.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like your body is already reacting to that worst-case scenario, even before you make the mistake. And when you try to push it away with your mind, it just gets more tangled up. 

Can you try noticing that tightness in your chest and the pounding in your heart right now – not as a warning that's "going to happen" when you make the mistake, but just as it is, while you're talking about it – what if you made room for that feeling, even if it didn't change the story that's running through your head?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying — my chest is tight, my heart's pounding, my breath is shallow and there's this knot in my stomach. But even if I make room for that feeling, the disaster movie in my head doesn't quiet: I mess up, lose shifts, can't cover rent, get kicked out, end up alone like before. It just feels pointless to notice the feeling because the prediction feels inevitable; I don't see how that helps.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The thought that noticing the feeling won't change what happens is a strong one – it feels like it's just a matter of "stopping" the pain before the "bad" outcome shows up. But what if, just for a moment, you could see that the knot in your stomach and the pounding in your heart weren't just about the mistake – but about the part of you that wants to protect yourself from feeling that way?

Patient: I get what you're saying about protection, but it doesn't feel protective — it feels like an alarm that screams "fire" so loud I can't think, and then the whole disaster script plays on repeat. Even when I name the tightness, the fortune-teller in my head just threads it into the same chain: lose shifts, lose my place, end up alone, like always — so noticing the knot kind of feels like putting a spotlight on the thing that fuels the panic. I'm trying to make room for it, but honestly it's frustrating and I don't see how that helps; can we dig into why the prediction feels more real to me than any other outcome?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot feels like "enabling" the story – like you're making room for the pain to show up, but that doesn't change the fact that the disaster prediction feels more solid than anything else. What if, instead of trying to make room for the knot, you could wonder what it would be like to see that story – the one about losing shifts and ending up alone – not as something that "has to happen," but as a choice you could make, if you wanted to.

Patient: A choice? That almost sounds like wishful thinking — the second I mess up, the head chef benches me, word gets around, my shifts get cut, I miss rent, get evicted, and I'm back alone like before. I can't act like that's a choice when it feels like the only timeline that actually happens, so it just feels pointless to try.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: That timeline feels like the only one that matters, and when you imagine the consequences, it feels like you're already living it. It's like trying to make a choice while you're already standing in the kitchen, with the kitchen fire burning – it's hard to think about what to do when you're so caught up in trying to prevent it.

Patient: Yeah, that's exactly it — it already feels like I'm living the timeline, like my brain slams the panic button and I'm on autopilot reacting to a future that's already happened. I know, on paper, other outcomes could happen, but they just feel like fantasies my head laughs at; telling me to choose a different path feels pointless and makes me more frustrated. Can we actually try to dig into why the prediction has so much weight, because I'm stuck and don't know where to start.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like having that prediction as the only "real" outcome is connected to what matters most to you – being safe, being in control, being able to provide for yourself. When you imagine losing shifts and ending up alone, what's happening inside you that feels like it would make you lose that sense of safety?

Patient: When I picture that chain, shame kicks in like a verdict — I tell myself I'm incompetent and unlovable, so whatever safety I had feels wiped out. My head stitches one mistake into absolute proof that I'll lose shifts, miss rent, get evicted and end up alone, and because it feels like proof the fear becomes certainty. If anyone suggests a different outcome I just dismiss it as fantasy — it doesn't land, and that makes me feel stuck and furious.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like when you imagine that chain, you're not just worried about losing shifts and being alone – you're worried about the story that says you're not good enough, that you're not lovable. And when that story comes up, you feel like you're already failing, like the shame is proof that you'll never be safe.

Patient: Yeah — that shame feels like a verdict that makes the doom-story real: I mess up, the head chef benches me, word gets around, my shifts get cut, I miss rent, get kicked out, and I'm alone. I know it sounds extreme, but my mind treats that chain as absolute fact, so when people suggest other outcomes I just get furious because it feels naive. I don't know why my brain gives that prediction so much weight and it's wrecking my ability to even try — can we actually work on why this feels more real than anything else?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when that shame comes up, it feels like it's not just a thought – it's like your whole body is saying "no way, you're not safe, you're not good enough." And when that happens, the doom-story feels like the only thing that matters. What if, instead of trying to change the story, you could just notice what's happening when that shame shows up – like you're seeing that "I'm not good enough" story show up, and it's making your whole body feel tight?

Patient: Okay, I'm trying to notice it — the "I'm not good enough" voice shows up and my chest tightens, my face heats, and I get this hollow panic in my stomach. But even when I name it, my brain grabs that as proof: I mess up, get benched, lose shifts, miss rent, get evicted, end up alone — so noticing feels like I'm feeding the fortune-teller instead of stopping it. I guess I want to know why my brain treats that shame like evidence and not just a feeling, because I'm stuck and it's driving me nuts.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to notice the feeling of shame, but your brain is still trying to use it as proof of the doom-story. What if, instead of trying to stop the shame, you could wonder what would happen if you let it be there – not as proof of anything, but just as a feeling?

Patient: I can try to let it be, but the moment I do it just feels like I'm shining a spotlight on the thing that fuels the fortune-teller — the shame gets louder and my disaster script gets more detailed. It doesn't feel like sitting with a feeling so much as feeding the evidence my brain uses to say I'll lose everything. I want to understand why noticing it becomes proof instead of relief, because right now that idea feels useless and just makes me more pissed off and stuck.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame feels like fueling the fortune-teller, which makes sense – when you're already feeling like you're not good enough, the shame story feels like it needs to be "proven" to be true. What if, instead of trying to notice it without feeding the fortune-teller, you could wonder what would happen if you tried to be with that feeling – not as proof of the doom-story, but just as it is – while you're still trying to make a shift?

Patient: That sounds like a nice idea on paper, but honestly it feels impossible in the middle of service — the moment I try to "be with" the shame my hands go shaky, I forget orders, dishes pile up, the head chef yells, I'm benched, shifts get cut, I miss rent, get evicted, and I'm alone. I can try to do it once, but I'm skeptical — what would "being with it" actually look like when I'm on the line and everything's collapsing around me? Because every time I try that kind of thing it just turns into more proof for the fortune-teller.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to "be with" the shame, the chaos on the line makes it impossible to notice the feeling, and instead, you're stuck in the story of "I'm not good enough" being proven true. What if, instead of trying to be with the shame while on the line, you could try noticing it right after the chaos passes – when you're standing off the line, washing dishes, or taking a break?

Patient: I can try to notice it in the back after service, but I'm skeptical — the second I let myself feel shame, even on a break, my head runs the whole chain and it follows me back to the line: I miss tickets, the chef notices I'm off, I'm benched, shifts cut, rent missed, evicted, alone. I don't see how pausing after chaos stops that; it feels like rearranging deck chairs while the ship's sinking — how would noticing then actually keep the fortune-teller from turning it into more "evidence"?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to notice shame even on a break, the fortune-teller just pulls out a bigger story to prove you're not good enough. What if, instead of trying to notice shame, you could wonder what would happen if you made a small, tiny step towards doing something you want to do – not to prove anything to the fortune-teller, but just because it matters to you?

Patient: Okay, a "tiny step" sounds fine in theory — like spending ten minutes before service to tighten one mise en place or just texting one friend — but my fortune-teller immediately turns that into: I get distracted, I miss a ticket, the chef yells, I'm benched, shifts get cut, I miss rent, get evicted, end up alone. So yeah, I'm skeptical — it feels like nudging one domino that definitely knocks everything over. How the hell am I supposed to try something small without feeding that whole disaster script?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you try to take a tiny step, the fortune-teller is already there, waiting to take the fall. What if, instead of trying to avoid the fortune-teller, you could wonder what would happen if you just made that tiny step *without* the story? Not to prove anything, but just to see what matters to you in that moment. Would you be willing to try it, not as a way to "not lose" everything, but just as a way to make room for what *is* happening in that moment?

Patient: Okay — I can try that tiny step, but I'm not thrilled about it. The moment I spend ten minutes prepping or text one friend, my brain will turn it into: I get distracted, miss a ticket, chef yells, I'm benched, shifts cut, miss rent, evicted, alone — so I'm doing it with this ugly expectation hanging over me, and that makes me tense and pissed off.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're doing the tiny step for the wrong reasons – not because it matters to you, but because you're trying to avoid the worst-case story. What if, instead of trying to make room for what matters to you, you could just notice what's making you tense and pissed off right now – *while* you're doing that tiny step?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice the tension while doing the ten minutes, but the second I do my brain snaps to the whole disaster movie — my hands go shaky, I fumble, chef yells, I'm benched, shifts cut, rent missed, evicted, alone. It makes me pissed and hopeless because noticing feels like I'm just giving the fortune-teller new ammo. Honestly, I don't see how that "while" noticing actually helps — can you explain what would change, or is that just another thing that feeds the doom-machine?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tension *while* doing the tiny step feels like fueling the fortune-teller instead of stopping it. 

Let's try to clarify what might change if you noticed the tension *without* trying to stop it – not because you're trying to avoid the worst-case story, but because you're curious about what's making you feel that way.

When your brain snaps to the disaster movie, what's happening in your body that makes you feel so *stuck* – not just in the moment, but when that feeling shows up again tomorrow, or next week?

Patient: My chest clamps, my heart races, my breathing gets shallow, my hands go shaky and my head goes fuzzy like I can't focus — it's like my whole body flips a switch and tells me something catastrophic is already happening. When that switch flips, my brain instantly runs the disaster movie and either freezes me or makes me overcompensate clumsily, which then feels like more proof. Because my body remembers that panic, it starts warning me before the next shift or the next week, so I dread things, avoid or over-prepare, then mess up more, and the fortune-teller in my head treats that as confirmation. I know that sounds fatalistic, but it honestly feels inevitable and it leaves me stuck and pissed off.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when that switch flips, your whole body is already responding like a warning system – and that warning system is so loud that it makes it impossible for you to focus on what's actually happening right now.

It feels like you're trying to fight that switch, but it's not just about fighting it – it's about understanding what it's trying to tell you. What would happen if, instead of trying to stop the switch, you noticed what it's trying to protect you from – not just in the moment, but when it shows up again tomorrow, or next week?

Patient: I guess it's trying to protect me from humiliation and being judged — like if I get called out for screwing up, that spirals into losing work and ending up without a place or anyone. But in practice that "protection" just flips into proof: I feel the alarm, fumble a ticket, chef yells, I'm benched, shifts cut, rent missed, evicted, alone — so noticing it feels like I'm handing the fortune-teller new evidence. I don't see how naming the threat would actually stop that chain; can you show me, concretely, how noticing would change anything?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Let's break it down, step by step. Imagine you're standing on the line, and your heart starts racing, your chest clamps, and your hands go shaky. Your brain immediately runs the disaster movie. 

Notice that *while* the alarm is going off, the ticket in your hand is still in your hand. You're still holding that ticket. 

If you *notice* the alarm without trying to stop it, what happens to the ticket in your hand?

Patient: The ticket's still there — physically in my hand — but my hands are shaking and my head's fuzzy so it's like I can't actually read or use it. Noticing the alarm doesn't make the shaking stop; if anything it just becomes more proof in my head — I fumble, the chef yells, I'm benched, shifts cut, rent missed, evicted, alone. I get why you're pointing at the ticket, but I need something concrete that actually helps me steady my hands in the moment, because "just notice it" feels useless and pissing me off.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: I'm not asking you to stop the shaking or the alarm. I'm asking you to notice what's happening while the shaking is still happening. 

Imagine you're holding that ticket, and your hand is shaking. You're trying to hold it steady, but it's slipping. 

What would happen if, just for a moment, you *looked* at the ticket – not at the shaking, not at the alarm, just at the ticket?

Patient: I try to look at the ticket, but my hands are trembling so bad the numbers blur and I can barely focus — the second I look my brain already says I drop it, the chef snaps, I'm benched, shifts get cut, I miss rent, get evicted, end up alone. It feels like staring at the ticket just gives the fortune-teller new fodder to prove itself, so I get more tense and pissed off. I don't see how "look at the ticket" actually steadies me in the moment — if you want me to try, tell me something concrete I can do right then besides just "look," because right now that suggestion just makes me angrier.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: I'm not asking you to just "look" anymore. I'm asking you to try a tiny, tiny thing that might help you connect with what's really happening in that moment. 

While your hands are shaking and the numbers are blurring, I want you to try to make one small *sound* with your voice – just a tiny "ahh" or a soft "mmm" – while you're holding that ticket.

Patient: Alright — fine, I'll try it. I make a soft "ahh" while holding the ticket and my throat loosens a fraction, my breath isn't quite as clipped, but my hands are still shaking and my head immediately turns it into: chef notices I'm rattled, benches me, shifts cut, miss rent, evicted, alone. It helps a tiny bit physically, but the fortune-teller grabs it as new evidence and I get pissed — what concrete step can I do in that moment that actually stops the rest of the chain instead of feeding it?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tiny sound helped a bit, but the fortune-teller still showed up.

When you notice your head turning that story into proof, what if you tried to make a small *choice* right then – not to try to stop the shaking or the alarm, but just to do one tiny thing that matters to you, even if it's hard?

Patient: I guess the tiny choice could be something like actually finishing that one ticket and saying “on it,” or stepping off the line for three breaths. But the second I do that my head already turns it into the whole chain — I’m slow, the chef yells, I get benched, shifts cut, miss rent, evicted, alone — so I’m skeptical it’ll change anything. I can try, but I’m pissed off and it already feels pointless.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make a small choice that matters, but your head is already pulling it back into the same story. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the chain, you tried to *make room* for it to be possible to do that small choice, even if it feels pointless right now?

Patient: Alright—I'll try to make room to do the small choice, even if it feels pointless. My chest's already tight imagining the chef yelling, being benched, shifts cut, missing rent, evicted, alone — but I'll try to take three breaths and finish the ticket anyway. I'm pissed that this feels like another thing my brain will turn into proof, but I'll give it a shot and report back how it lands.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try making room for that small choice, even if it feels like your brain is already setting you up for disappointment. 

When you take those three breaths and try to finish the ticket, what would it mean to you to *not* make that choice – not to say "on it" or not to step off the line – if your brain still shows up with that story anyway?

Patient: It would feel like folding — like I'm proving the fortune-teller right, which in my head means the whole chain becomes real: the chef benches me, shifts get cut, I miss rent, get evicted, end up alone. That would feel like both cowardice and proof, which makes me furious and numb, but I'm also terrified that doing anything could make it happen anyway. I don't know how to stop being stuck between being too scared to act and too scared to not act.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you think about not making that choice, it feels like you're not just failing – you're also failing to be brave. And that failure feels like it's already happening, even if you don't do the choice.

Can I ask, what's the difference between being stuck between being too scared to act and too scared to not act? What would happen if, instead of trying to choose between those two feelings, you tried to notice what's *really* happening in your body when you're feeling stuck?

Patient: They're basically the same panic in different clothes — being too scared to act freezes me, which then feels like proof I suck; being too scared to not act makes me overdo stuff and mess things up, which also becomes proof. When I try to notice what's happening in my body, my chest clamps, my breathing gets shallow, my hands tremble, my face heats up, and the fortune-teller voice gets louder, stitching those sensations into the whole chain — chef yells, benched, shifts cut, miss rent, evicted, alone. Noticing just makes me more furious because it feels like I'm handing the voice more ammo. So what would you actually want me to look for in my body right now, because I keep getting stuck on that loop?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening in your body is actually making it worse, because it feels like you're giving the fortune-teller more power.

In that moment, I don't want you to notice what's happening in your body. I want you to notice what's happening *when* you're noticing that story – the one about being frozen, or overdoing things, or proving yourself wrong.

Patient: When I notice the story, it feels like a second voice kicks in — my chest tightens more, my face heats, and this bitter, accusing narrator says, "See? Told you so," and starts hunting for proof. My head goes into fast-forward, replaying the chain: miss a ticket, chef yells, benched, shifts cut, miss rent, evicted, alone. I get furious and frozen at the same time; noticing just seems to give the fortune-teller a microphone. So seriously, what am I supposed to do with that noticing—hold it and wait for it to fold, or do something concrete that actually changes the chain, because right now it just makes me more stuck.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the noticing itself is becoming the problem – it's not just the story that's the issue, but the way that noticing is reinforcing it.

In that moment, I don't want you to try to hold the noticing or change it. I want you to try something completely different. What if, instead of noticing the story or the fortune-teller's voice, you tried to notice what would happen if you *saw* the story as just that – a story – not as proof?

Patient: If I call it "just a story," the fortune-teller in my head immediately whispers, "Yeah? That just means it's the next chapter," and my chest clamps like it always does. Labeling it doesn't stop the movie — I still play out getting benched, shifts cut, missing rent, getting evicted, ending up alone — so saying "story" feels like putting a sticker on the same wreckage. I can try to pretend it's just words for a minute, but it just makes me angrier and more tense; how do you expect that label to actually change what's happening in my body, not just my vocabulary?
