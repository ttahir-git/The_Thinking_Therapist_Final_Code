Patient: I'm really overwhelmed lately — I've been stuck in this low, unmotivated slump since feeling so isolated, and it's starting to wreck my relationship because I'm emotionally checked out. My head won't stop predicting the worst: she'll get tired of me, leave, I'll tank at work from lack of focus, lose my job, and end up completely alone and humiliated. I know it sounds dramatic, but honestly that's the only realistic story I can see.

Therapist: That sounds like a really heavy burden to carry. When you say your head won't stop predicting the worst, what happens when you notice that story showing up – like, what's the tone of your mind when those thoughts come up?

Patient: It's loud and certain, like some smug announcer who's already printed the headline—urgent, accusing, and absolutely convinced. When it shows up my chest tightens and my whole brain zooms into that story—she leaves, I bomb at work, I'm left totally alone—and I can't stop replaying it like it's already happened. I try to tell myself other things, but that voice just swallows them and feels more real than anything else.

Therapist: So the story feels like it's happening in real time, even when it's not actually true – like your chest tightening and that mental replaying is what makes it feel like the worst-case scenario is unfolding. What happens if you tried to notice that "smug announcer" voice showing up just for a moment – not to argue with it, but to see it as just that – a story your mind is telling you?

Patient: I try that, but it doesn't stick — the moment I try to step back the announcer just cranks up louder and more detailed: she'll snap, leave, I'll freeze at work, get fired, and wind up utterly alone and embarrassed. I'm frustrated because calling it "just a story" feels like pretending everything's fine and that'll leave me blindsided when the disaster I can already see actually happens.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to step back feels like it's not enough to protect you from the pain of that story. When that "just a story" thought doesn't stick, what would it be like to notice that the announcer is getting louder *while* you're trying to step back – not to stop it, but to see it *with* the tightness in your chest?

Patient: When I try to hold them both, the announcer just narrates the tightness and they feed each other—my breath gets shallow and everything feels like it's speeding toward that outcome. I can see the whole chain: I snap at her, she gets fed up and leaves, I freeze at work, get fired, and end up totally humiliated and alone. Trying to "watch it" feels pointless—like standing there saying, "Yep, there's the train," while it's already barreling toward me.

Therapist: So the tightness and the story are like two trains running on the same tracks – one's the physical sensation and the other's the narrative. And when you try to hold both, they just keep moving forward together. What if, instead of trying to stop the train or hold the tightness, you just made space for the thought "that chain of events" to show up – without trying to change it?

Patient: When I try to make space it just feels like giving the announcer a bigger stage — it fills it with even worse details and my chest tightens more. I catch myself waiting for the first slip-up so the story can prove itself, so "making space" just feels like a setup for the disaster, not a refuge. I don't see how I hold space without it turning into the disaster reel.

Therapist: So the fear of making space is actually what makes it feel like a setup for the story – like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. What if, instead of trying to make space so the story doesn't happen, you tried making space *for* the story to happen – not because it would prove anything, but because you might actually *see* what's making it feel so important?

Patient: If I actually make space for it, it turns into a movie I can't turn off — I see the argument, she snaps and leaves, I freeze at the meeting, get fired, friends drift away, and I'm left utterly alone and humiliated. Part of me is terrified to even watch it, but another part is weirdly hooked because it feels like preparation — like if I can picture the collapse I won't be blindsided. I don't see how watching it without trying to stop it would help; that feels like sitting in a burning room and saying I'm "just observing" while everything falls apart, and I'm pissed off because it all feels inevitable.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is holding a lot of power for you right now – not just because it's "what might happen," but because it feels like a test of your worth. When you picture the worst-case scenario, what's it *about* that feels like preparation – not to avoid it, but to what matters when that's what matters most to you?

Patient: Mostly it feels like rehearsing the collapse so I won't be blindsided — if I can see every step, I can brace for the humiliation and have an explanation ready. It's less about avoiding the event and more about avoiding being the one who looks stupid or weak afterward; predicting it gives me a tiny bit of control or cover. And honestly, other outcomes sound like denial — if I don't imagine the worst, I'm the sucker who missed the warning signs.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is serving as a kind of "protection" for you – not from the event itself, but from what you think might happen if you *don't* see it coming. You're right that predicting it gives you a sense of control, and that's what matters most to you right now.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. Predicting the collapse is my only armor; if I don't rehearse it I swear I'll be blindsided and look pathetic — I can already see her walking out, coworkers whispering, me getting frozen at the meeting and fired, friends drifting away. I know other outcomes sound "nicer," but they feel like denial, and it pisses me off when someone suggests them like they actually understand how real this feels.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is your only way of making sense of what matters to you right now – the feeling of being vulnerable and exposed. When you imagine the worst-case scenario, it's not that you're trying to avoid the event, but that you're trying to protect yourself from feeling *that* vulnerability. Can you try making room for that feeling *while* you're still imagining the worst-case scenario – not to change it, but to see what matters about it?

Patient: I can try, but when I make room I just notice this hollow, shame-filled ache in my chest and the announcer goes full-on, piling on more humiliating detail. Making space feels like handing him a megaphone — instead of clarifying what matters, it just proves the disaster is real. Honestly, what matters to me is not looking weak or blindsided; other outcomes feel like denial, and I'm pissed off that anyone would expect me to pretend those aren't the only realistic ones.

Therapist: So when you make room, the shame and the announcer come back, and that feels like giving him even more power. It sounds like what matters to you is being able to show up with that vulnerability, even when it feels like the worst-case scenario is true – not because you want to prove the disaster is real, but because you want to be able to do what matters to you, even when it's hard.

Patient: I get that in theory, but in practice being "vulnerable" feels like admitting defeat — the announcer immediately scripts me confessing, she storms out, coworkers whisper, I freeze in the meeting and get canned, and I'm left with nothing. I want to do what matters, but rehearsing the collapse feels like the only way I can protect myself from being blindsided.

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of being vulnerable is actually the opposite of what matters to you – it's about being seen as weak or defeated. When you imagine the worst-case scenario, what matters is actually being able to *do* what matters, not just be able to be vulnerable about it.

Patient: I get that, but vulnerability feels like admitting defeat—if I open up the announcer already scripts it into proof: she'll storm out, I'll freeze in meetings, get fired, and be humiliated. I'm the kind of person who wants to do something concrete to fix the relationship and keep my job, but every action my mind predicts will just backfire. I don't see how sitting with feelings helps—can we talk about practical steps I can try that won't just feed the announcer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to move forward that feels concrete and action-oriented, but the announcer's predictions are holding you back. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the situation or avoid the worst-case scenario, you tried making room for what matters to you – like doing something concrete to support your relationship or show up at work – while still noticing the feelings that show up?

Patient: Okay... I can try that, but I'm so worn down — every practical move I picture the announcer already scripts the disaster: I try to talk, she storms out; I prep for the meeting, I freeze and get canned. If we're doing "concrete," give me tiny, specific steps I can actually do that won't just become fodder for him—exact phrases or one-minute actions—because I don't have the energy for anything that just proves him right.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for tiny, specific actions that might help you move forward, even when the announcer's predictions are holding you back. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the situation, you tried doing one tiny thing that feels important to you – like making a cup of coffee or sending a text to a friend – while noticing the feelings that show up?

Patient: Okay... I can try one tiny thing, but I'm wiped — if I'm going to do anything I need exact, tiny steps I can actually follow without my head turning them into fodder. Give me a one‑sentence text I can send her right now and a 10‑second breathing cue or one‑sentence opener I can use if I start to freeze in the meeting; don't give me platitudes like "she might understand" — I need the exact words.

Therapist: Here's a possible text: "Hey, I'm feeling really overwhelmed with work right now and I'm worried I'm not doing enough – can we talk about what's stressing me out?"

And here's a possible breathing cue: "In for 5... "

(Note: I'm not suggesting that you send this text or use this breathing cue without considering what matters to you. I'm just offering a possible example of what might be helpful.)

Patient: Okay... that text might work, but my brain already scripts her reading it and snapping, "You're dramatizing," and walking out. Still — one-sentence text I can actually send now: "Can we talk for 10 minutes tonight? I'm overwhelmed and could really use your support—is 8pm okay?" Breathing cue for 10 seconds: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds. If I start to freeze in the meeting, I'll say: "I need a brief moment—I'm feeling overwhelmed." I'm wiped, but I'll try sending that—now tell me what to do if she reacts badly, because I can already see the argument and worst-case fallout.

Therapist: It sounds like you're preparing for a worst-case scenario, but what if, instead of focusing on how she might react, you focused on what matters to you right now – like getting support and feeling less overwhelmed?

Patient: What matters to me is actually feeling less alone and getting some real support, not arguing about who's right. But I'm drained and I can already hear the announcer scripting her snapping, "You're dramatizing," and storming out. Give me two one‑sentence lines I can use if she reacts badly—one to try to de‑escalate, one to protect my boundaries—and a 5‑second phrase I can say in the meeting if I start to freeze; I doubt it'll work, but I'll try.

Therapist: Here are two possible one-sentence lines:

To de-escalate: "I'm feeling really hurt when you dismiss my feelings – can we find a way to listen to each other?"

To protect your boundaries: "I need some space to think about this – can we talk about it later?"

And here's a 5-second phrase for the meeting: "I'm taking a deep breath – what's one thing I can do right now to show up for the team?"

Patient: I'll try those, but I can already hear the announcer—if I send the "10 minutes" text she'll snap "You're dramatizing," walk out, and that'll kick off everything else. Give me one exact sentence I can copy‑paste to send if she replies angrily right away, and one exact sentence to send if she doesn't reply by 10pm. Also... if the breathing doesn't stop me freezing in the meeting, what's one two‑second line I can actually say to break the spiral?

Therapist: If she snaps angrily right away, you could send: "I'm not trying to dramatize – I'm feeling really scared and I need your help."

If she doesn't reply by 10pm, you could send: "I'm going to bed now, but I'd love to talk about this in the morning when I feel calmer."

And if the breathing doesn't stop you from freezing in the meeting, you could say: "I need to get the papers – *gets papers* – and *takes a deep breath* – that's all I can do right now."

Patient: I’ll try sending them, but my head already shows her snapping “You’re dramatizing,” slamming the door, and then everyone at work whispering and me getting canned. If she actually walks out or goes silent for days, give me one exact sentence I can send that won’t sound pathetic; and if a coworker starts whispering after I freeze, what two‑second line do I actually say to stop the spiral?

Therapist: If she walks out or goes silent for days, you could send: "I'm noticing the silence, but I'm still here and I'm committed to doing my job."

If a coworker starts whispering after you freeze, you could say: "I'm not okay right now – can we talk about what I can do to help the team move forward?"

Patient: Okay... I'll try those, but I can already see her snapping "You're dramatizing" and leaving, and that "I'm noticing the silence..." turning into crickets. Give me one exact, non‑needy sentence to send if she replies "You're dramatizing" that sets a boundary without begging, one short sentence to send if she hasn't replied in a week, and a two‑second line I can blurt at coworkers that actually stops the whispering without sounding weak.

Therapist: If she replies "You're dramatizing", you could send: "I'm taking that as my cue to focus on my work."

If she hasn't replied in a week, you could send: "I'm going to assume we're okay for now."

If coworkers start whispering after you freeze, you could say: "I need to do this *action* – *takes action* – and then I'm available to talk."

Patient: Those feel too soft. Give me exact copy‑paste lines I can actually use:

1) If she says "You're dramatizing": "I hear you. I'm stepping away from this conversation until we can talk respectfully."  
2) If she hasn't replied in a week: "I haven't heard from you; I'm going to focus on work for now—let me know when you're ready to talk."  
3) Two‑second line to coworkers to stop whispering: "I'll handle this—please bring any concerns to me later."

I can already hear the announcer scripting how she'll slam the door anyway, but... I'll try these.

Therapist: Those exact lines are direct, clear, and set boundaries without begging. You're preparing for the worst-case scenario, but you're also taking small steps to protect yourself and your relationships. Remember that you're not trying to "fix" her or make her respond; you're focusing on what matters to you.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to messages, but the announcer's already playing the whole collapse—her storming out, silence, whispers, me getting canned. I'm wiped and don't have the energy to debate it—give me one short, honest line I can say to myself right after I hit send that doesn't sound like denial but might shut him up for ten seconds.

Therapist: In that moment, you could say to yourself: "I've done what matters to me."

Patient: Okay... I'll try saying "I've done what matters to me," but I can already hear the announcer sneering that it's meaningless and the whole collapse will still play out. I don't have much left—give me one very short grounding phrase (two or three words) I can whisper if his voice won't shut up.

Therapist: "Two breaths"

Patient: Okay... I'll try whispering "two breaths" when it gets loud, but the announcer's already sneering that it's useless and the whole collapse will still happen. If that doesn't shut him up, give me one more tiny word or phrase I can use—something I can actually grab in the moment.

Therapist: "Done."

Patient: Okay... I'll whisper "done," but the announcer's already sneering that it's useless and the whole collapse will still play out. I'm wiped—give me one two-word action I can actually do right after I send the text, something practical I can do in ten seconds that won't just feed him.

Therapist: Get a cup of coffee

Patient: Okay... I'll get a cup of coffee. My head's already narrating it—I'll spill it, she'll walk in thinking I'm being passive‑aggressive, storm out, and that'll kick off the collapse. Still, I'll do it. If that happens, what's one very small next move I can make that won't just feed the announcer?

Therapist: Make a phone call to a trusted friend or colleague while you're sipping the coffee

Patient: Okay... I'll call while I sip the coffee, but I can already hear the announcer: no answer, voicemail, or they pick up annoyed and hang up — and that'll feel like proof I'm alone. If they don't pick up, give me one short text I can send that doesn't sound pathetic.

Therapist: "Checking in"

Patient: Okay... I'll send "Checking in," but the announcer's already narrating the worst—no reply, or she reads it and thinks I'm pathetic, and that silence kicks off the collapse. My energy's really low right now—give me one exact, calm sentence I can send if she doesn't reply in 24 hours that doesn't sound needy.
