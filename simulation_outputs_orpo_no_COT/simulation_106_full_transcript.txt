--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm an older manager who just started a demanding new program at work, and I'm finding myself getting furious and frustrated in meetings and with colleagues more than I used to. I'm still carrying grief from a recent loss, and it only makes those snaps worse even though I'm usually pretty upbeat. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help—I've tried talking before, so how is this supposed to make a difference?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like your frustration and anger are already really familiar to you, and it's understandable that you might wonder if this will make a difference when you've tried other approaches before.

Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel that fury rising up in meetings – what would you be doing or saying if you weren't already so tight around it?

Patient: I get this tightness in my chest and jaw, my hands clench and my voice wants to snap — heat rises and I can feel my face go red. I want to call people out or just get up and leave meetings, but I bite it down because I'm supposed to be the steady manager, and with the grief everything feels raw so it explodes more easily. Usually I end up making a joke or changing the subject and stewing later; I've tried breathing and counting and stuff, it helps for a minute — how is that supposed to help long-term?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tightness and the urge to snap are really connected to the grief you're carrying – like it's fueling your anger. And when you try to manage it with breathing or counting, it might give you a brief break, but then what happens when the pain comes back?

Patient: It hits me in waves — I'll hold it together in the meeting, make a joke, then later I'm seething and replaying every little thing, snapping at my partner or drinking more than I should. Sometimes I just go quiet and avoid the next meeting, which makes me feel useless and guilty, so the anger turns inward and then explodes later. I've done breathing, walks, journaling — it blunts it for a bit but the grief drags me right back; honestly, how is talking here supposed to stop that loop?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to manage the anger with breathing and avoiding it when it hits is actually making it worse – like it's a temporary fix, but the pain is still there. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the pain or the anger, you just noticed it showing up – like you're saying to yourself, "Oh, it's that tightness again" – without trying to change it?

Patient: I get the idea of watching the wave instead of bashing my head against it, but honestly that sounds a lot like letting it sit there and stew. I've tried being mindful and naming feelings before—how is that supposed to stop me from going home seething and snapping at my partner? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing the tightness and naming the feelings is just letting it sit there – like it's not actually helping you move towards what matters to you. 

What matters most to you right now – not just in your work, but in your relationship with your partner and in taking care of yourself?

Patient: I want to stop blowing up at work — to stay steady so I don't lose my footing in this new program — and I want to be decent with my partner instead of snapping or shutting down. I also want to stop numbing out with drinks and actually sleep instead of replaying meetings all night. I'm not convinced talking about it here will make that happen though — I'm trying to see how this connects to what I actually do when the heat rises, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to connect the pain and the tightness to the things that matter most to you – staying steady at work, being decent with your partner, and taking care of yourself. 

What if, instead of trying to make a plan or figure out how to "stop" the tightness, you just made room for what's already working for you – like noticing when you're steady at work or connecting with your partner when you're not snapping?

Patient: Maybe there's something to that — last Tuesday I actually didn't snap when a junior questioned my plan; I asked one clarifying question and steered us back on track. But how is noticing that supposed to stop the nights I replay every jab and drink until I pass out? I've tried noticing before and it feels like a Band‑Aid — what would I actually do differently when the heat comes next time?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that moment of calm at work is important, but you're worried it won't help with the bigger picture – the replaying and drinking at night. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the replaying entirely, you made room for it as one part of what matters – like noticing when you're replaying and thinking, "You know what would be really helpful right now? If I could just be steady at work and decent with my partner, even when I'm tired"?

Patient: Okay, that idea sort of makes sense — maybe if I catch myself replaying I could remind myself what I actually want: to be steady at work and decent with my partner. But when I'm in that spiral I don't get to reminders; I get wired and reach for a drink or replay every line until I can't sleep — how is a thought like that actually supposed to change what I do in the moment? I did have one night where I texted my partner “I need you” and it stopped me from drinking as much, so maybe small, concrete moves could help, but I'm skeptical they'll hold up when the program gets really brutal.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that just thinking about what matters might not be enough to change what you do in the moment – especially when things get tough. 

What if, instead of just thinking about what matters, you tried making one small move that would help you stay connected to what matters, even when you're not sure what to do next? Like, what would it take for you to text your partner that one time, just to stop the drinking – not to solve everything, but just to make that small space between "I need you" and reaching for the drink?

Patient: Okay — I think it'd have to be ridiculously easy, like a one‑tap saved text ("I need you") and an alarm preset for right after big meetings so I don't have to think. My worry is I'll freeze, or feel like I'm bothering them, or just ignore the alarm when I'm wired — how is that supposed to help when I'm seething? I'll try saving a message and setting an alarm tonight after my meeting, but honestly I need a backup plan for if I just shut down or get distracted.


--- Turn 8 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that even the small, easy move might not be enough to help you stay connected when things get tough. 

What if, instead of trying to make it perfect, you just tried it – the one-tap text, the alarm – and then said to yourself, "If I freeze, what's one tiny thing I can do to get back on track that feels even smaller than trying to save the message"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Maybe the tiniest thing I could do is have a one‑tap saved "I need you" text or even a single emoji ready so all I do is press send, and a backup could be putting the phone face‑up and physically touching it when the alarm goes off so there's a tiny motor action to break the freeze. I'll try the one‑tap text and alarm tonight, but I'm confused and honestly doubtful it won't just feel like another Band‑Aid when I'm already spiraling.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to figure out what's holding you back from trying the small move, and you're noticing that it's not just about the move itself, but about what happens when you're already spiraling. 

What if, instead of thinking "this won't work," you said to yourself "I'm already spiraling, and I want to see what happens if I try the small move anyway"?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "I'm already spiraling, I'll try the small move" supposed to make me actually press send when I'm wired? I'll try telling myself that and set the alarm and one‑tap message tonight, but if I freeze I usually just stare at the phone or walk away. I'm skeptical, but willing to try — what would you suggest I do in that exact split second when everything locks up?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to move forward even when everything feels stuck. 

In that exact moment when everything locks up, what's one tiny thing you could do with your hands that doesn't require you to think or move your head – just something small with your fingers?

Patient: I guess I could do something tiny like tap the phone screen with my thumb to send the saved text, squeeze a small worry‑stone or stress ball in my pocket, or press my thumb into the heel of my palm a few times (that kinda grounding pressure helps sometimes). I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to stop the spiral when my whole body's locked up? I'll try the thumb‑tap and a worry‑stone tonight, but I'm doubtful it'll be enough on its own.


--- Turn 11 ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to connect with your body when it feels frozen, and you're noticing that some small actions can help with that. 

What if, instead of trying to "stop the spiral" entirely, you just noticed what happens in your body when you tap the phone – what sensations show up, like the pressure of your thumb or the feeling of the stone in your pocket?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? When I actually tap the phone or squeeze a stone I do notice a tiny pressure under my thumb, my jaw loosens a bit, and sometimes my breath catches then settles an inch. Problem is most of the time my brain's replaying lines so fast I don't register that stuff until later, and then it's too late. I can try to pay attention to those little sensations tonight, but if I don't feel anything then what do you want me to do in that split second?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to notice the small things that happen when you tap the phone or squeeze the stone, and you're worried that if you don't notice those sensations, it won't help. 

What if, in that exact moment when everything feels stuck, you just let the replaying lines be there – without trying to change them or notice them – and instead, just allowed the tiny pressure under your thumb to be there, even if you don't feel it right now?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is letting the replaying lines run and paying attention to a little thumb pressure supposed to stop me from spiraling later? I can try it: let the thoughts be and feel the thumb or the stone, but usually by the time I register anything I'm already halfway to the bottle. I'll try it tonight with the one‑tap text and the worry‑stone, but honestly I'm skeptical it will hold up when the program gets brutal.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to stop the spiral before it starts, and you're worried that just letting things be might not be enough. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the spiral before it starts, you just noticed what happens when you do try to stop it – when you reach for the bottle or start replaying lines – what's one small thing you could do right then that feels like it matters, even if it's just taking a tiny breath?

Patient: Maybe the tiny thing is just a single slow exhale — like breathe out for two seconds — or press my thumb into my palm and hit the one‑tap text, or even take one deliberate step out of the room to get air. I'm not sure I follow — how is a breath or a thumb‑tap supposed to stop the replaying and the drinking later? I'll try the thumb‑press plus a breath tonight, but honestly I need a better backup if I just freeze.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to stop the replaying and the drinking later, and you're worried that just a breath or a thumb-tap might not be enough. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the replaying and the drinking later, you just noticed what happens when you do try to stop it right now – when you reach for the bottle or start replaying lines – what would it take for you to move forward even if you don't stop it completely?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? Maybe "move forward" could just mean doing one tiny, concrete thing that breaks the loop: hit the one‑tap text, do a single slow exhale, and step outside or to the stairwell for 60 seconds. If I freeze, the alarm vibrating in my pocket and a preset swipe might be the tiny motor action that drags me back; I'll try that, but honestly I need suggestions for a backup if I still end up numbing out later.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to break the loop right now, and you're thinking that hitting the one-tap text, doing a slow exhale, or stepping outside might be enough to get you moving. 

What if, when you notice yourself freezing or numbing out, you tried to make room for one tiny movement that doesn't require thinking – like putting your foot on the floor, or letting your arm drop down to your side?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is putting my foot on the floor or letting my arm drop supposed to help when I'm already frozen? Maybe the tiniest thing that could work is a deliberate foot stamp, a single tap on the table, letting my arm fall and squeezing a stress ball, or pressing my thumb into my palm — something that the alarm vibration could nudge me to do. I'm frustrated and skeptical — it sounds like another Band‑Aid — but I'll try it tonight with the alarm, one‑tap text, and a backup squeeze ball; if I still freeze, I usually just walk away or stare, and that part I don't know how to fix.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find something tangible to do when you're frozen, and you're willing to try the alarm vibration as a nudge. 

What if, when you notice the alarm vibration and feel like you're about to walk away or stare, you just said to yourself "I'm not going to do anything yet" – without trying to do anything else – and instead, you noticed the feeling of your feet on the floor or the sensation of the air on your skin?

Patient: How is saying "I'm not going to do anything yet" supposed to stop me from walking out or grabbing a drink? I mean, I can try the alarm, the one‑tap text, and training myself to notice my feet or the air — I'll do that tonight with the squeeze ball ready — but I'm frustrated and skeptical it won't hold up in a brutal meeting. If I still freeze and just walk away or stare, what do you suggest I actually do in that moment so I don't end up numbing out later?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to stay with the sensation of freezing, even when it feels like you're about to walk away or grab a drink. 

What if, when you notice the freeze, you didn't try to stop it or change it – but instead, you noticed that it was making the thought "I need to get out of this" show up – and then you said to yourself, "That's a thought. What would it be like to be with that thought, even if I didn't want to leave the meeting – just for a moment?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is naming "I need to get out" as a thought supposed to help? When I try that it just feels like permission to leave or like I'm being passive, and later I end up drinking or snapping. I can try saying it in a meeting, but what would I actually do next when the heat goes up?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like naming the thought "I need to get out" as a way to feel like you're in control is actually making it harder for you to stay in the meeting when things get tough. 

What if, when you notice the freeze, you didn't try to make the thought go away – but instead, you just noticed what your body was doing in that moment – like what was your foot doing on the floor, or what was your arm doing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is noticing my foot or arm supposed to help? Usually when I freeze my foot tucks under the chair or I start tapping it, my hands curl around a pen, my shoulders hike up and my jaw locks. I can try to notice that, but most times I only register it after I've already checked out — what would you want me to do with that in the moment?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing your physical sensations is happening after you've already checked out – like you're noticing what's already happened, rather than what's happening right now. 

What if, when you notice your foot tucking under the chair, your hands curling around the pen, your shoulders hiking up, and your jaw locking – you didn't try to change any of those things, but instead, you just noticed them, like they're just happening – and then you asked yourself, "What's the one tiny thing I can do right now that matters, even if I'm not feeling it in my body?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? If I had to pick one tiny thing right now it'd be pressing my thumb into the heel of my hand and doing a single slow exhale, or hitting the one‑tap "I need you" text if the alarm goes off. I'll try that tonight, but with the grief and this brutal new program I'm doubtful it'll hold up — if I freeze and walk away or stare, what do you actually want me to do next?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try the small actions you mentioned, and you're looking for what to do next when you freeze. 

What if, when you notice yourself freezing and walking away, you didn't try to change it – but instead, you just said to yourself, "I'm here, and I'm not sure what to do next" – and then you took one tiny step towards something that matters to you, even if it was just standing up and walking to the water cooler, or sitting down and opening your laptop – not to fix everything, but just to be with the feeling of being stuck.

Patient: I can try saying "I'm here, and I'm not sure what to do next"—but how is that supposed to help? Usually if I say something like that I feel exposed and then either walk out or go numb, and later I end up drinking or snapping. I can do the water‑cooler or open my laptop, but if that tiny step doesn't pull me back, what do you actually want me to do next?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm here, and I'm not sure what to do next" is actually making you feel more stuck. 

What if, instead of trying to say that phrase, you just did the tiny step – like getting up and walking to the water cooler, or opening your laptop – and then you noticed what happened in your body and mind when you did it – not because you were trying to "fix" anything, but because you were curious about what would happen if you just showed up with that small action?

Patient: Okay — I can try just doing the tiny step without trying to fix anything, like getting water or opening my laptop and noticing what shifts. I'm not sure I follow how "curiosity" actually stops the replay later though — usually I do a little thing and still stew or drink that night. If that tiny move doesn't pull me back, what's a concrete next step I can take in the moment so I don't end up numbing out?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how curiosity about what happens after the tiny step would actually help you stop replaying later. 

What if, when you notice yourself replaying lines or getting stuck, you didn't try to stop it – but instead, you noticed what your body was doing in that moment – like what your foot was doing on the floor, or what your arm was doing – and then you made a small decision to do something with that sensation, like taking a deep breath or noticing the feeling of the air on your skin?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I can try noticing my foot or arm and then take a slow breath, feel the air on my skin, or squeeze the worry‑stone, but usually by then I'm already replaying and halfway to the drink. If that tiny move doesn't pull me back, what's the next concrete thing you want me to do in that moment so I don't just numb out later?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how noticing your body and taking a slow breath would actually help you stop replaying later. 

What if, when you notice yourself replaying lines and getting stuck, you didn't try to stop it – but instead, you simply made room for that replaying, like you're holding a space for it to be there – and then you chose to do one tiny action that matters to you in that moment, like making a phone call, sending a text, or writing a note – not because you're trying to fix the replaying, but because you're trying to stay connected to what matters to you right now?

Patient: I get the idea — let the replay run but do one tiny thing that keeps me tied to what matters. But how is a text or a quick call actually supposed to stop me from numbing out later? I'll try the one‑tap "I need you," the alarm, and the worry‑stone tonight, but if I still freeze and none of that drags me back, what do you want me to do in that exact moment?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how doing a small action like sending a text or making a call would actually help you stop numbing out later. 

What if, in that moment when you feel like you're freezing and replaying lines – not because you're trying to stop the replaying, but because you're noticing it's happening – you didn't try to fix it or make it stop. You just noticed the feeling of being stuck, and then you looked around you and saw what was right in front of you – like the phone on the desk, or the chair beneath you. And in that moment, you chose to do something with that sensation, like picking up the phone and dialing the number of the one person who might understand what you're going through – not because you needed them to fix your replaying, but because you needed to be with the feeling of being stuck, and the person was there to be with you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is calling someone supposed to help if they don't pick up or I freeze mid‑call? Sometimes that "I need you" text actually stopped me from drinking, so I can see the logic that a voice might ground me, but I'm worried about sounding needy or bothering them. I could set a quick‑dial, save a one‑line script ("I'm overwhelmed — can you stay on the phone for five minutes?"), and use that as my first move, but if they don't answer or I hang up, what's the next concrete thing you want me to do? I'm willing to try it, but honestly skeptical it'll hold up in a brutal meeting.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about how the person will respond, and that's making you hesitant to try it. 

What if, instead of trying to control how they respond, you focused on what you could do with your body when you felt stuck – like taking a deep breath, noticing your feet on the floor, or making a small movement with your hand? 

If you did call the person, and they didn't answer or you hung up, what would happen to the feeling of being stuck right then? Would it still be there, or would something else show up?

Patient: If they don't pick up or I hang up, the stuck feeling usually gets louder — I feel more desperate or stupid, and that's when I either reach for a drink or go completely numb. Every so often there's a tiny relief that I tried, but with the grief it's more often replay and self‑blame. How is that supposed to help, though — if the call fails, do you want me to squeeze the stone, step outside, hit the one‑tap text, or what exact tiny thing should I do that I won't just ignore when I'm already wired?
