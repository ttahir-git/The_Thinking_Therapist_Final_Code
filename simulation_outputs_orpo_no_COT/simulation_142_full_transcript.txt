--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been thinking a lot about how I intellectualize my feelings — I turn things into problems to solve instead of actually feeling them, especially since that health scare and having to readjust. As a student it's gotten worse; I tell myself it's efficient, but I guess it's just a way to not be overwhelmed. I don't know, it feels like I'm avoiding the real stuff and I don't know how to stop.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing a pattern where your mind gets caught up in trying to make sense of your feelings, even when that means pushing them aside. What happens when you imagine stopping that intellectualizing for just a moment – what would be like to notice that feeling without trying to solve it or fix it first?

Patient: I don't know...when I try to stop, my chest gets tight and my thoughts just start racing—like if I'm not analyzing it, I feel like I'm falling apart. I guess it feels dangerous, like if I let it be messy I won't be able to function, so I immediately start listing causes or solutions. I don't know, it's hard to stay with it—can we maybe talk about how that's been affecting my schoolwork?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fear of what might happen if you don't control your thoughts is really strong for you. 

Instead of exploring what might happen if you let your chest get tight, what would be like to notice that feeling in your body, even when the thoughts come up – just for a moment, while you're sitting here?

Patient: I don't know...when I try to notice it, there's this tightness in my chest and my breathing gets shallow, like a knot that won't ease. My brain immediately starts listing causes or solutions, so I can't just sit with it — I guess it feels unsafe. Can we slow down? I'm not great at staying with sensations; what would I even do next?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that knot in your chest is already making it hard to stay with it. 

If, just for a second, you could make room for that knot – not to try to push it away, but just to be with it while you're breathing – what would that mean for what's next?

Patient: I don't know...maybe making room would mean I could breathe a bit and not immediately spiral into solving everything. But I guess it also feels scary—like if I let it sit, I'll fall apart and won't get school stuff done. Can we slow down? What would a practical first step look like, because I don't know how to just "be" with it.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about losing control and falling apart – but what if, instead of trying to solve everything, you just made room for that knot to be there while you're doing one small thing you need to get done?

Patient: I don't know...maybe doing one small thing while noticing the knot could help, but it already feels like too much. I guess I'd need something really concrete—like a one-minute breathing check or a five-minute timer to work on a single paragraph—but I'm worried I'll just start analyzing whether I'm doing it "right" and spiral. Can you help me pick a tiny practical first step I could actually try now? I'm nervous about this.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Let's try something tiny. When you notice that knot in your chest, what happens when you look at your hands right now – what's the sensation in your hands, the feeling of the chair beneath you?

Patient: I don't know...my hands feel a little clammy and my fingers are kind of tense, like I'm gripping my knees even though I'm not. The chair is firm against my lower back and my shoulders feel raised, and my breathing's shallow. Can we try that one-minute breathing check now? I'm nervous about it.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: Let's try it. When you breathe in, notice that clammy feeling in your hands – what happens when you imagine letting it be there, just for a second – as you breathe out.

Patient: I don't know...when I breathe in I definitely notice the clamminess and the tension in my fingers, and when I breathe out it feels like a tiny loosening, but my brain immediately starts judging whether I'm doing it "right." I guess my shoulders drop a little, but it feels fragile and I keep waiting for the knot to come back. Can we set a one-minute timer or something so I don't overthink it—what should I do if the thoughts start racing again?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Let's set a 1-minute timer. If your thoughts start racing, what happens when you notice them – what if you just say to yourself "I see this thought" and let it pass, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know...when I notice the racing thoughts my chest just tightens and I immediately start listing causes or fixes, like I have to solve it. I guess saying "I see this thought" might help, but I'm worried I'll just judge myself for doing it wrong. Can we try the one-minute timer now and you remind me to use the phrase if I start overthinking?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Let's set the timer. When you're ready, take a deep breath in and out, and when you're done, I'll remind you to say "I see this thought" if your mind starts racing again.

Patient: I don't know...I did the one-minute breath. My shoulders eased a little but my head immediately started judging and listing fixes, like it always does. I guess you can remind me now to say "I see this thought" because I'm already starting to spiral.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: When your mind starts listing causes or fixes, I'll remind you to say "I see this thought". Take a moment to notice that tightness in your chest, and when you're ready, say "I see this thought".

Patient: "I see this thought." Saying it made the tightness loosen a tiny bit, but then my brain immediately started judging whether I said it "right" and listing what I should do next. I don't know...can we slow down? I'm worried I'll just drift back into analyzing everything.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that thought was a tiny step forward. When you say "I see this thought", what happens to the tightness in your chest, just for a moment, before your brain starts judging again – is there any room for it to be there, even if you don't "do it right"?

Patient: I don't know...for a second it does loosen, like a tiny gap where I can actually breathe. I guess there's a little room, but it's fragile and my brain immediately pokes at it with judgment—can we slow down and make the next step concrete, like what I actually do when that judging starts?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Let's make a tiny concrete step. When you notice that judgment, what happens if you just pause for 5 seconds – not to judge it, just to be with it – before you do what you usually do with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is pausing for five seconds supposed to help? I don't know...when I try to pause my head just fills up with fixes and judgments about whether I'm doing it "right," so the pause becomes another thing to analyze. I guess if I actually managed those five seconds the knot might loosen a bit, but I'm nervous I'd just start overthinking the pause. Can we slow down and try it now with you guiding me, like you count out the five seconds?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Let's try it. I'll count out the five seconds. When you notice the judgment, I'll say "1...". And when you're ready, we'll pause together for a moment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I guess I'll try, but I'm really nervous it'll just become another thing to analyze. Can you go ahead and count now, and if my thoughts start racing remind me to say "I see this thought"? Also... can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Let's start again. When you're ready, take a deep breath in and out. *counts slowly* 1...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I don't know, I'll try. Breathing in now and my chest already feels tight and my thoughts are jumping to everything I need to do, I guess. Can you keep counting and remind me to say "I see this thought" if I start overthinking?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *continues counting* 2... When you notice your thoughts starting to jump, what happens if you just say "I see this thought" to them, without trying to change them?

Patient: I don't know...when I try to say "I see this thought" my brain just snaps to a to-do list and my chest clenches more, so I can't tell if it helped. I guess saying it silently might be less weird, but I'm really distracted and keep losing the moment. Can you keep counting and remind me to say it—slowly? I'm not great at this and I'm getting anxious.


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: *speaks slowly* 3... When your thoughts start to jump again, just notice them showing up in your mind. Don't try to change them, just say "I see this thought".

Patient: I don't know…I'm not sure I follow—I'm trying to say "I see this thought" but my mind just flips into a to‑do list and my chest tightens more, so I can't tell if I'm actually doing it. I guess I did it silently once but it felt fake and my brain kept racing. Can you keep counting slowly and prompt me to say it when I start overthinking? I'm feeling kind of scattered.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: *speaks very slowly* 4... Your chest is feeling tight. What's one tiny thing you can do in this moment, just for 5 seconds, without trying to fix everything?

Patient: I don't know...maybe I can press my fingertips together for five seconds and just notice the feeling. I'm really jumpy and my mind's already racing, so can you keep counting slowly and nudge me to say "I see this thought" if I start drifting?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: *continues counting* 5... Now, just notice those fingertips pressing together. What happens to the feeling in your chest while you keep them there.

Patient: I don't know...pressing my fingertips makes the tightness ease a tiny bit, but my thoughts are already skittering to everything I have to do and my breathing's still shallow. I guess it does help a little, but I'm really jittery and distracted—can you keep counting and prompt me to say "I see this thought" if I start drifting?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: *speaks slowly* 6... Your fingers are still pressed together. What happens if you just notice that "I have to do" thought showing up, without trying to push it away or fix it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — I try to notice that "I have to do" thought and it immediately flips into a to‑do list and my chest clamps down. I guess pressing my fingertips helps a tiny bit, but I'm really distracted and keep analyzing the noticing itself. Can you keep guiding and prompt me to say "I see this thought" if I start drifting?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *speaks slowly* 7... The tightness is still there, but you're holding your fingers together. What happens if you just let that thought "I have to do" be there, for one second, without trying to change it? Just say "I see this thought".

Patient: I don't know...I'll try. "I see this thought." Saying it quietly eased the tightness a little, but my head immediately jumps to more tasks and starts criticizing how I did it. I guess I need you to keep guiding me slowly—can you prompt me again if I start drifting?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *speaks very slowly* 8... The thought "I see this thought" is still there. Your chest is a little softer now. What happens if you just notice the thought "I'm not doing it right" showing up, without trying to change it? Just say "I see this thought".

Patient: I don't know... "I see this thought." Saying it makes the tightness ease a smidge, but then the "I'm not doing it right" voice immediately shows up and I start criticizing myself and listing what I should've done. I guess I need you to keep guiding me slowly—can we slow down and try another short prompt? I'm feeling pretty anxious and scattered.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *speaks very slowly* 9... Your fingers are still pressed together. The thought "I see this thought" is still there. What happens if you just notice the sensation of your chest, without trying to change it – just notice it.

Patient: I don't know...when I try to just notice my chest it feels tight and fluttery, like I can't take a full breath, and my mind immediately snaps to a to‑do list. I'm feeling jumpy and distracted right now — can you guide me slowly or count with me again? I guess pressing my fingertips helped a tiny bit before.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *speaks slowly* 10... Your fingers are still pressed together. The tightness is still there. Let's take one more deep breath together... *pauses* When you're ready, I'll count again, or we can try something new. What would happen if we just sat with this feeling for 5 seconds, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just sitting supposed to help? I don't know, my mind's already racing to a to‑do list and my chest feels tight, so it seems like another thing to analyze. I guess we can try, but can you count the five seconds and remind me to say "I see this thought" if I start overthinking? I'm really jittery and could use you guiding me slowly.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *speaks slowly* 1... You're willing to try sitting with the feeling. I'll count the seconds and remind you to say "I see this thought" if you start overthinking. Just notice the sensation in your chest for 5 seconds, without trying to change it.

Patient: I don't know...I'll try to sit with it, but my chest is already tight and my mind's racing to everything I need to do. Can you count the five seconds and remind me to say "I see this thought" if I start analyzing? I'm feeling pretty jittery and distracted, so please go slowly.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *speaks very slowly* 2... Your chest is still tight. I'm going to count again, slowly. *pauses* When you notice that thought showing up, "I need to do this," just say "I see this thought".

Patient: I don't know...the "I need to do this" thought just showed up — "I see this thought." Saying it loosened my chest a tiny bit, but then I started judging whether I did it right and my mind jumped to the tasks. Can you keep counting slowly and nudge me to say it again if I start spiraling? I'm feeling pretty scattered.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *speaks slowly* 3... Your chest is a little softer now. I'm counting again. *pauses* When that "I should've done it" thought shows up, just notice it saying "I see this thought".

Patient: I don't know... "I see this thought." It eased the tightness a tiny bit, but then my brain started criticizing and flipping to a to‑do list and I felt even more jittery and scattered. Can you keep counting slowly and nudge me again when I start drifting?
