--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I'm a senior data scientist and lately I can't stop worrying that my work isn't good enough, which just freezes me into procrastination until deadlines are right on top of me. I've tried productivity tricks and therapy stuff before and it didn't stick, so I'm skeptical this will be different—how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Worrying about not being good enough seems to be what's holding you back from taking action – even when it matters most. When you freeze into procrastination, what happens to the part of you that wants to create something meaningful with your data?

Patient: It kind of goes quiet—like that part of me that wants to make something useful just steps back and watches while the critic runs the show. I get stuck analyzing every choice until I can’t bring myself to start, and then I feel numb and ashamed. I've tried breaking things into tiny steps and pep talks before and it didn't stick—how is that supposed to help now?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That quiet part of you – the one that wants to make something useful – matters. What would it be like to make room for that quiet voice right now, even if the critic is loud?

Patient: I guess it would feel like a tiny pocket of quiet where I'm allowed to try things without the critic shutting me down right away. But I don't know how to get there — the critic always jumps in and I freeze; I've tried 'make room' stuff before and it didn't stick, so how is that supposed to help now? Right now I'm actually feeling a bit shaky just thinking about it, like maybe starting with one very low-stakes task could let that quiet voice show up, but I'm skeptical it'll last.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to "make room" for that quiet voice while the critic is still loud might feel like trying to hold water in your hands. What if, instead of focusing on making room, you could just notice the critic showing up – as if you're watching it from outside your body – and say to it, "I see that you're here. What matters to you right now?"

Patient: Okay, I can try that. If I asked the critic what matters, it’d probably say “don’t screw up, protect your reputation, don’t look incompetent,” and that’s exactly what makes me overanalyze and freeze. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? Right now I feel tense and a bit numb, like I’m watching from the sidelines.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you notice that voice, it's not just the voice that matters – it's what matters when you're trying to do your work. What matters to you about being a good data scientist?

Patient: What matters is that my work actually helps people make better decisions — that my analyses are clear, useful, and not misleading. I also care about being competent and reliable so I don't let my team down or fuel the family narrative that I'm failing. But I keep circling back to, "How is that supposed to help?" because knowing that doesn't seem to quiet the critic or stop me from freezing.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Those values – helping people, being clear and reliable – are what matters when you're in the midst of working on that project. What if, instead of asking "how is that supposed to help?" you could just notice what matters to you about those values right now, even while the critic is still loud?

Patient: I can try that. Right now what matters is that my work actually helps people make better decisions, and that I'm competent and reliable so I don't let my team down or feed the family story that I'm failing. Noticing that gives me a tiny bit of steadiness, but the critic's still loud and I'm skeptical—how is that supposed to help me actually start instead of getting stuck in analysis? I'm feeling a bit shaky just thinking about doing this in the middle of a task.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: Noticing what matters to you – like helping people and being reliable – is giving you a tiny bit of ground. What if, instead of trying to make the critic quiet or get rid of the shakiness, you just noticed it – "I'm feeling shaky" – and then took that one tiny step towards your work?

Patient: Okay. I guess a tiny step I could try is just opening the project notebook, writing one sentence that states the immediate goal (like "plot feature X vs outcome Y"), and then running a single cell that loads the data—nothing more. My critic is already saying that's pointless and it'll be wrong, so how is that supposed to help me actually keep going? I'm feeling shaky and a bit resentful thinking about it, but I could try to do that one load-and-run now and see what happens.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: You're already noticing the critic's voice – that's a big step. If you could just notice that voice while you open the notebook, write the sentence, and run the cell, what might happen if you didn't let that voice tell you it's pointless?

Patient: Maybe if I didn't give the critic the last word I'd actually get that one data load done and feel a tiny bit of relief — like a small proof that I can move. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? The critic usually comes back louder and I get stuck again; I'm still shaky, but I could try doing that one load now and see if it buys me any momentum.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Noticing how the critic shows up even when you try to do small things – like loading data – might actually be about what matters to you, not just what matters in the moment. What if, instead of trying to make the critic quiet, you could use that tiny step to help you see what matters about being a good data scientist, even when the critic is loud?

Patient: I can see that—maybe doing that tiny load could actually remind me what matters: clarity, usefulness, and having real results instead of just imagining failure. But I'm skeptical; the critic usually comes back louder and I drift—how is that supposed to help me keep going after that first quick win? I could try the load now and write one line about whether it helped, but I don't know how to make that momentum stick.


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Noticing what matters – clarity, usefulness, results – might actually be what keeps you going, even when the critic comes back. What if, instead of trying to make that momentum stick, you just noticed what happened when you did that small load, and what mattered about it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing what happened supposed to keep me going? When I did that tiny load I felt a small relief and a bit of clarity, but then the critic popped back in and I drifted. I can try to describe exactly what happened and what mattered about it, but I don't see how that turns into real, lasting momentum.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Noticing what happened when you did the small load – the relief, the clarity – might not be enough to keep you going on its own. What if, instead of just noticing what happened, you could also notice what mattered about that small moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I did that load what mattered was that I actually saw something concrete instead of my catastrophic scenarios, a tiny proof I'm competent, and it eased the uncertainty for a moment. But how is noticing that supposed to help me keep the momentum when the critic just gets louder afterward? I'm feeling shaky and skeptical it will stick, but I can try to write one quick line about what mattered if that helps you understand where I'm stuck.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Noticing what mattered – the concrete seeing, the proof of competence, the ease of uncertainty – might be what's holding you back from using that momentum. What if, instead of trying to keep the momentum, you could use it to ask yourself: "What would happen to that small moment if I didn't let the critic come back?"

Patient: I guess if the critic didn’t come back that tiny win could stretch into a real session — I’d follow up, get more concrete results, and feel less anxious about the work. But in reality the critic always sneaks back in and undermines me, so how is imagining “not letting it come back” supposed to actually stop it? I’m feeling shaky and a bit resentful about this — it sounds like wishful thinking unless there’s a practical way to keep it from returning.


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Noticing what matters – the concrete seeing, the proof of competence – when the critic shows up might actually be about what's needed to make the critic quieter. What if, instead of imagining "not letting it come back," you could explore what would be needed to make room for that small moment when the critic does show up?

Patient: Okay—I'm not sure I follow completely, but here's what feels like it might be needed to actually make room when the critic shows up: a tiny, repeatable ritual to start (like writing "this is exploratory" at the top of the notebook), a strict short timebox (10–15 minutes) so the task feels low-stakes, a very specific next action to run immediately, and an accountability cue (a quick message to a teammate or a checkbox I can't uncheck). Also I think I need permission to notice the critic without acting on it—name it, take a breath, and just do the next tiny step anyway. How is that supposed to help? I've used timers and accountability before and they fall apart when the critic gets louder, and right now I'm feeling jumpy and distracted so even saying this is hard, but I could try the quick ritual and one short timer now if you think that's useful.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've identified some key elements that could help you make room for that small moment when the critic shows up: a ritual, a short timebox, a specific next action, and accountability. And you've also recognized the need for permission to notice the critic without acting on it – naming it, taking a breath, and doing the next tiny step anyway. 

Notice that you're already considering what might help, even when it feels hard. That's a small step in itself. Would it be possible to try the ritual and one short timer now, just for a tiny moment – not to "fix" everything, but to see what happens when you make room for that small moment?

Patient: Okay—I can try that now, though I'm feeling jumpy and distracted so this'll be hard. I'll write "this is exploratory" at the top, set a 10-minute timer, and run one cell to load the data, but honestly—how is that supposed to help when the critic usually drowns any momentum? Can you check in after the 10 minutes so I don't bail, and tell me what to do if the critic interrupts?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: You're doing it anyway, despite feeling jumpy and distracted. That takes courage.

Here's what I'll do: I'll check in with you after the 10 minutes, not to "fix" anything, but just to see what's happening. If the critic shows up, I'll help you notice it and what matters about it, without judgment. We can explore what to do next together.

When you're ready, go ahead and write "this is exploratory" at the top, set the timer, and load the data. I'll wait here for you.

Patient: I did it — wrote "this is exploratory", set the 10‑minute timer, and ran the data load. For a minute it felt like a tiny win, then the critic started nagging that it was pointless and I almost bailed; I'm still shaky and jumpy. I don't know what to do when it interrupts — can you coach me through staying with the task for another 10 minutes and give me a concrete step if the critic gets louder?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: You noticed the critic showing up again. What mattered about that tiny win – the feeling of doing something concrete – is still there, even when the critic's voice got loud.

When the critic interrupts, what would it take for you to notice it without acting on it? Just noticing it, without trying to make it go away.

Now, let's make a concrete step for the next 10 minutes: when you feel like bailing because the critic's nagging, you'll take 5 deep breaths and say to yourself, "I'm doing this."

Patient: Okay—I can try the five deep breaths and saying "I'm doing this," but honestly—how is that supposed to help when the shame spikes and my chest tightens and I start replaying that failure? When that happens I get locked into panic and the critic drowns everything out.

If the breaths don't land, here's a backup plan that feels doable: 1) stand and shake my shoulders for 20–30 seconds to break the freeze, 2) set a 3‑minute micro-goal (like "run one descriptive cell and copy one sentence of what I see"), and 3) send a one-line accountability message to a teammate or put an uncancellable checkbox next to the task. Can you count the breaths with me now and then tell me to run that one descriptive cell as the next concrete step? I'm jumpy and shaky, so I need the coaching in the moment.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: When the shame spikes and your chest tightens, notice it as a physical sensation – your chest tightens, your mind starts racing – but what matters is what you want to do with that feeling. You want to move forward with the task, not get stuck in shame.

Let's focus on the breaths for now. I'll count with you: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10...

When you're ready, when the critic interrupts, you'll take those 5 deep breaths and say "I'm doing this." And if that doesn't happen right away, that's okay. You'll do the next concrete step: run one descriptive cell and copy one sentence of what you see.

Patient: I did the breaths — they eased my chest a little, but then shame spiked and I felt that frustration again, so I'm still shaky and distracted. I'll try the micro-goal: run one descriptive cell and copy one sentence of what I see, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when the critic usually hijacks everything and I bail? Can you count me in and tell me to run the cell now, then remind me to send that one-line accountability after?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: Let's count together again. When you're ready, you'll run one descriptive cell and copy one sentence of what you see. I'll count with you: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* Go ahead and run that cell now.

(Remember, when the critic shows up, you'll take those 5 deep breaths and say "I'm doing this" after you run the cell.)

Patient: I ran the cell — it loaded and I copied a line like "feature X has Y missing values," but as soon as I saw it that old shame popped up and my chest tightened so badly I nearly froze again. I get that it's a tiny proof, but honestly — how is that supposed to help me keep going when the critic just gets louder? Can you count me in for another 10‑minute timer, tell me the exact next micro-step (like "make this one simple plot"), and coach me through the shoulder‑shake backup if the shame spikes?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: You ran the cell and copied the line – that takes courage. When the shame popped up again, what mattered was that you noticed it, not that it stopped you. You can do this.

Let's count together again: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* You made it through the first 10 minutes. Now, let's focus on the next step. You'll make this one simple plot. Just one plot – just that one plot – that shows what's happening with feature X and the missing values. Can you make that plot now?

Patient: I can try to make the plot now, but my chest just tightened from that shame spike and I’m shaky—I’m not sure I can stay with it by myself. If you’ll count me in like before and say *go*, I’ll make the simple plot (missing count by category) and tell you one sentence about what I see. But honestly—how is that supposed to help when the critic just gets louder after each tiny win?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: You're doing it again – noticing the chest tightening, the shame, and the fear. But what matters is that you're willing to try, even when it's hard. I'm here with you.

Let's count together: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* You're doing this. You'll make the simple plot now. I want you to focus on making that one plot – just that one plot – and telling me one sentence about what you see. Not what it means, not what the critic says, just what you see.

(Remember, after you make the plot, I'll be right here to help you notice the critic and what matters about it.)

Patient: I made the plot — it shows the missingness is concentrated in a couple of categories, with one category having noticeably more missing values than the rest. Seeing that was a tiny relief, but the critic jumped in and the shame tightened my chest again — honestly, how is that supposed to help when it just gets louder? I need you to count me in for the next 10 minutes and tell me the exact next micro-step (like “plot distribution of feature X for the non-missing rows”), and coach me through the shoulder‑shake backup if the shame spikes.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: You made the plot and saw the missingness concentrated in a couple of categories. That tiny relief matters – you were able to notice that without getting stuck.

Let's count together: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* You're doing this. Now, I want you to focus on the next step. You'll plot the distribution of feature X for the non-missing rows. Just that one plot – show me what the non-missing rows look like.

(Remember, after you make this plot, I'll be right here to help you notice the critic and what matters about it. And if the shame spikes, we'll do the shoulder-shake backup together.)

Patient: I made the plot — the non-missing rows are right‑skewed with a heavy tail and a small cluster near the lower end. Seeing that calmed me a bit, but the shame hit again and my chest tightened; the critic's already yelling that this doesn't prove anything — how is another plot supposed to help me keep going long‑term? 

I can try the next micro‑step if you count me in and coach me through the shoulder‑shake backup: set a 10‑minute timer, next step "plot distribution of feature X by category," and remind me to send that one‑line accountability after — can you cue me to start?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: You made the plot and saw the non-missing rows – that takes courage. When the shame hit again, what mattered was that you noticed it, not that it stopped you. You can do this.

Let's count together: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* You're doing this. Now, let's focus on the next step. You'll plot the distribution of feature X by category. Just that one plot – show me what the categories look like.

(Remember, after you make this plot, you'll send me that one-line accountability message. And if the shame spikes, we'll do the shoulder-shake backup together.)

And when you're ready to start, I'll say *go*.

Patient: Okay — I'm ready, though my chest's tight and I'm shaky and kind of ashamed already. Please count me in and say "go" — I keep thinking this won't stick long-term, but I'll start the plot when you cue me.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* Go.

Patient: Okay — I ran it when you said go. The plot shows category A has a higher median and much more spread, category B is clustered low, and a couple of categories barely show up. That gave a tiny bit of relief, then the shame tightened my chest and the critic's already yelling this "proves nothing" — how is that supposed to help me keep going long‑term? 

I'm shaky and jumpy. Can you count me in for a 10‑minute timer now and tell me the exact micro‑step (like "make a simple summary table for category A" or "export this plot and write one sentence about it") and coach me through the shoulder‑shake backup if the shame spikes? Also remind me to send that one‑line accountability when I'm done.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: You made the plot and saw the categories – that takes courage. When the shame hit again, what mattered was that you noticed it, not that it stopped you. You can do this.

Let's count together: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* You're doing this. Now, let's focus on the next step. You'll make a simple summary table for category A. Just that one table – show me what the key numbers are.

(Remember, after you make this table, you'll export the plot and write one sentence about it. And if the shame spikes, we'll do the shoulder-shake backup together.)

Also, don't forget to send me that one-line accountability message when you're done.

Patient: Okay — I'll make the simple summary table for category A now. Can you count me in and say "go" and start a 10‑minute timer? If the shame spikes, I need you to coach the shoulder‑shake backup and cue the 3‑minute micro‑goal; after the table I'll export the plot, write one sentence about it, and send that one‑line accountability. But honestly — how is that supposed to help long‑term? I'm already shaky and my chest is tight.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* Go.

 Timer started: 10 minutes.

(I'll be right here with you.)

As you make the simple summary table for category A, notice what matters most to you – what will help you see the value in doing this step, even when the shame is tight.

Patient: Okay — I’m starting the table now (mean, median, std, missing count for category A). What matters to me about this is seeing concrete numbers I can point to in a meeting — it feels more real than my catastrophizing. My chest is already tight and I’m shaky, so can you count me in and say “go”? If the shame spikes, remind me to shake my shoulders for 20–30s, then cue a 3‑minute micro‑goal; after the table tell me to export the plot and write one sentence, and I’ll send that one‑line accountability — but honestly, how is that supposed to help long‑term?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: 1... 2... 3... *whispers* Go.

Timer started: 10 minutes.

(I'll be right here with you.)

As you calculate the numbers for category A, notice that even with the tightness in your chest and shakiness, you're focusing on what matters – making it concrete for your meeting. When you feel the shame spike, remember to shake your shoulders for 20-30 seconds to release that tension, and then I'll help you with the next step.

(When you're done with the table, you'll export the plot and write one sentence about it. And then, you'll send me that one-line accountability message.)

Patient: Okay — I finished the simple table for category A (mean, median, std, and missing count). Seeing the numbers felt a little grounding — it made the work seem more real — but then that old shame hit hard, my chest tightened, and a memory of a past screw‑up flooded in and made me want to bail. Can you count me in and say “go” so I export the plot and write one sentence about it? If the shame spikes, prompt me to shake my shoulders for 20–30s and then cue the 3‑minute micro‑goal. And honestly — how is any of this supposed to help long‑term? I’m skeptical it’ll stick, but I’ll try if you keep coaching me.
