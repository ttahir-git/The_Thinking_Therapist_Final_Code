Patient: I've been feeling really stuck — like my life is nothing but my job as a social worker and I don't know what matters beyond that, especially with money problems wearing me down. I'm pretty skeptical this will help; I've tried talking before and it didn't do much. How is this supposed to help me figure out where to go from here?

Therapist: What matters most to you when you feel stuck, right now, with your job and money worries weighing on you?

Patient: What matters most is feeling like I'm more than my job — having some sense of purpose and connections that aren't wrapped up in being a social worker. Financial security matters too; the money worry just saps everything and makes it hard to think long-term. But honestly, how is talking about "what matters" supposed to help? I've tried reflecting on this before and it didn't change a thing.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to think about what matters, the worry about money just gets in the way. What if, instead of trying to think about what matters, you could make room for that worry right where it is?

Patient: Okay, that sounds...kind of reasonable, but how is just "making room" supposed to change anything when the worry grabs everything? When bills pile up I can't just set it aside — it feels like it'll ruin everything. I've tried mindfulness and breathing before and it didn't stick; can you give me a concrete step or example of what "making room" would actually look like for me?

Therapist: When you say the worry feels like it'll ruin everything, what would happen to that feeling if you could make room for it just for 30 seconds – while you're still worrying about the bills?

Patient: I guess if I actually tried it for 30 seconds, I'd notice the tightness in my chest and the nagging thoughts — they'd still be there, but maybe a bit separate, like I could watch them instead of being inside them. Maybe they'd feel a little less all-consuming, like turning the volume down on the radio instead of smashing it. But listen, I did mindfulness before and it didn't stick — how is noticing the tightness for half a minute supposed to help me pay the bills or give me direction long-term? Can you show me an actual, minute-by-minute example of how to do that right now?

Therapist: Let's try this with you. When you notice the tightness in your chest, can you make a tiny decision to stay with it for just 5 more breaths – while you're still worrying about the bills?

Patient: Okay, alright — I'll try it. Breath in… out (1), in… out (2), in… out (3), in… out (4), in… out (5). The tightness is still there but it's a little softer, like the edges got sanded down — not gone, just not as screaming. But seriously, how is taking five breaths supposed to help me pay my bills or figure out what else matters beyond being a social worker?

Therapist: That's a good note to come back to – you noticed the tightness softened, but you're still wondering how that helps with the bigger questions. What if, for just 10 more minutes, you could keep that tiny decision to stay with the tightness – not to change it, not to fix it, but just to be with it – while you also started to look at your bills?

Patient: Alright, I can give you ten minutes, but I'm skeptical — how exactly do you want me to split my attention? Do I keep breathing slowly while glancing at bills, or set a timer to alternate between a minute of the tightness and a minute of looking at paperwork? I get distracted and the worry swallows me, so give me a concrete, minute-by-minute plan I can actually follow.

Therapist: Let's try this. For the next 10 minutes, I want you to keep breathing slowly and softly – not trying to change the tightness, just noticing it – while you look at your bills. Here's how you can split your attention: take a deep breath in (1), look at your bills for 30 seconds (2), take another deep breath in (3), look at your bills for another 30 seconds (4).

Patient: Okay, I'll try it. (Breath in… out.) I look at the stack — most are familiar, but that past-due notice makes my stomach tighten again. The breathing softened it a bit, but honestly, when I see the numbers my mind just jumps around — how is this going to help me actually deal with them? Do you want me to make a quick priority list while I breathe, or should I be scripting a call to one creditor right now?

Therapist: The numbers are still jumping around, but you noticed the past-due notice. Instead of trying to make a priority list or script a call right now, I want you to notice what's holding you back from taking action – what's the thought that's making you want to jump away.

Patient: I think the big one is: “If I do anything, I’ll mess it up” — like calling will make things worse or I’ll promise what I can’t keep and get in deeper. There’s also this nagging voice that I’m too old to change, so why bother looking for things beyond my job. And shame — focusing on bills feels like admitting I can’t cope, so my mind flees to distractions. But seriously, how is just naming these thoughts supposed to keep them from hijacking me when a payment’s due?

Therapist: Those thoughts are really showing up for you. Instead of trying to push them away or change them, what if you could just notice them – like you're holding them in your hand – while you keep looking at the bills?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — hold the thoughts in my hand while I look at the bills? How is that supposed to help when the worry jumps up and starts yelling at me? If I try it, maybe I can imagine the thought “I’ll mess it up” as a small scrap of paper in my palm and set it next to the pile instead of shoving it in my head, and notice the shame without doing anything about it. But honestly, I’ve tried that kind of thing before and the thoughts just start shouting louder, so tell me what I’m supposed to do when it starts yelling and I freeze.

Therapist: When the thoughts start shouting, what would happen if you kept looking at the bills – not because you're trying to ignore the thoughts, but because you noticed the tightness in your chest is still there, even when the thought says "you'll mess it up"?

Patient: If I kept looking, I guess I might spot one tiny, doable thing — like that past‑due notice maybe has a phone number I could call to ask for a payment plan. But the thought “you’ll mess it up” still shoots through me and I freeze, picturing myself stumbling over words and making it worse. How is staying with the tightness supposed to actually get me to make that call? If you want me to try, give me an exact little script or line to say, because otherwise I just talk myself out of it.

Therapist: I can see how staying with the tightness feels like it's not enough to make the call. What if, instead of trying to silence the thought, you said to yourself: "I'm going to take that one step, even if it feels like I'll mess it up."

Patient: Okay… I can try saying that to myself, but I'm not sure I follow how saying it actually changes anything — how is that supposed to stop me from freezing? Still, alright: "I'm going to take that one step, even if I mess it up." Saying it feels a bit silly, but maybe it loosens me enough to act. If that's the plan, give me the exact one-line script to call that number, because otherwise I'll just hang up.

Therapist: I can see you're willing to try. Here's the one line: "Hello, I'm calling about the past-due notice on my account."

Patient: Okay… I’ll try it now: “Hello, I’m calling about the past-due notice on my account.” My voice’s already wobbling just saying it — I know I’ll freeze if they push. If they ask “Can you pay now?” what’s a tiny, safe thing I can say that doesn’t commit me to more than I can do? And if they ask for proof or transfer me, give me one short line to keep me talking without panicking. How is this supposed to help my shame in the moment, though — I’m skeptical, but… let’s roleplay it if you want me to actually do the call.

Therapist: When they ask "Can you pay now?", you could say: "I'm not sure yet, I'm just trying to figure out what my options are." 

If they ask for proof or transfer you, you could say: "Can you tell me what you need me to show?"

Let's try the call now. I'll be the person on the other end.

Patient: "Hello, I'm calling about the past-due notice on my account." My voice might wobble a bit — I'm nervous, so please bear with me.

Therapist: "Hello, this is the account manager. I see you have a past-due notice on your account. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on and why the payment is late?"

Patient: My income dropped recently and I had some unexpected expenses, so I fell behind on this bill. I'm not sure yet — I'm just trying to figure out what my options. I worry I'll mess it up if I say the wrong thing, but could you tell me about payment plans or any hardship assistance you offer?

Therapist: "I understand that things can be tough when your income changes. We do offer hardship assistance programs that can help you get back on track. Let me see what options we have available... (pause) Okay, it looks like we can set up a payment plan that would allow you to make smaller payments over time. Would you like me to walk you through the details?"

Patient: Yes, please—I'd like that, but I'm nervous. Could you tell me what the monthly payment would be and whether setting up a plan would stop more late fees or collections for now? 

Also—if I agree on the call, what’s one short thing I can say that doesn’t lock me into more than I can actually pay? Maybe: “That sounds workable—could you please send the terms in writing so I can confirm?” Is that okay? I keep worrying I’ll promise too much and make it worse, so I need something safe to say.

Therapist: "Okay, the monthly payment would be $X, and setting up a payment plan would definitely stop any additional late fees or collections activity for now. As for confirming the terms, that's a great idea. Here's what you can say: 'That sounds workable—could you please send the terms in writing so I can confirm?' That way, you're not committing to anything, and you can review the plan before we move forward."

It sounds like you're really focusing on what matters – not wanting to promise too much. That's great.

Patient: Okay — that line helps, but I'm suddenly feeling jittery and my mind's darting all over. Can we roleplay me asking them to email the terms and practice what to say if they say they can't? And honestly, how does getting terms in writing actually help with the shame I feel in the moment — I always wonder if paperwork will just make it more real.

Therapist: Let's try the roleplay. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Okay, I've sent the terms to your email. They'll include the monthly payment amount, the payment plan details, and the confirmation of the stop on late fees and collections. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reply to the email or give me a call."

Now, let's practice what to say if they say they can't. You mentioned earlier that you worry about saying the wrong thing. What if they say something like: "I'm afraid we can't offer you a payment plan at this time"? What would you say then?

Patient: If they say they can't offer a plan, I'd probably try something simple and noncommittal like: "I understand—could you tell me why that's not possible right now?" Then follow with: "Is there a supervisor or a hardship team I could speak with about other options?" and "Could you please put a note on my account that I'm actively trying to resolve this so collections are paused while we figure this out?" Finally: "Could you send that decision and any appeal instructions in writing so I can review them?"

But… I'm not sure I follow how asking for a supervisor or a note actually helps — they can still say no, and I'll feel worse. My hands are jittery just thinking about it. Can we roleplay them saying "no" now so I can practice what to say next?

Therapist: Let's roleplay the scenario where they say "no" to offering a payment plan. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

Now, let's practice what to say next. You mentioned wanting to try the simple and noncommittal approach: "I understand—could you tell me why that's not possible right now?"

You followed that up with asking about a supervisor and a note on your account. Let's focus on the note for now. If they say "no" to the note, what would you say to make it clear that you're trying to resolve the situation and keep collections paused?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — if they say no to the note, I'd probably say something like: "I understand. If you can't add a note, could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact for appeals so I have something to show I'm trying to resolve this?"  

If they still refuse: "Could you at least put in writing what you just told me or confirm the decision and any appeal steps by email? I need a record that I reached out and asked for options."  

And if that fails, I'd ask: "Is there a supervisor or hardship team I can speak with right now? I'm actively trying to fix this and need to pause collections while I do." — but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the shame in me when they say no? My hands are all jittery just thinking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really trying to protect yourself from feeling trapped or helpless. When they say "no" to the note, you're trying to make sure you have a record of your efforts and that you have a clear path forward.

One thing that might help is to focus on what matters to you, not what they say. When they say "no" to the note, you could say to yourself: "That's okay. I'm still trying to find a way to make this work. I'll keep pushing for what matters to me."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying "That's okay, I'll keep pushing" supposed to blunt the shame when they just told me no? My hands are still jittery and my head's darting all over. I can try that line, but it feels hollow — can you give me one concrete, one-sentence thing I can say to myself in the moment that actually feels doable? And while we're at it, can we roleplay them saying no again so I can practice that self-line and the exact short sentence to ask for an appeals contact?

Therapist: When you're feeling the shame, what's one tiny thought that might be true for you, just for a moment, that you could notice without judgment?

Patient: Maybe something small like, "I'm trying right now, and that counts," or "I'm taking one step." 

Feels a bit thin though — how is noticing that actually going to quiet the shame when they say no? Can we roleplay them saying no again so I can try that line and the short sentence to ask for an appeals contact?

Therapist: Let's try the roleplay again. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

Now, you can try saying to yourself: "I'm trying right now, and that counts." 

And then, you can say to the account manager: "I'd like to appeal this decision. Can you give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact for appeals so I have something to show I'm trying to resolve this?"

Let's focus on the sentence to the account manager. What would you say to them if they said "no" to that request?

Patient: If they say no, I'll tell myself quietly, "I'm trying right now, and that counts," so I don't spiral. Then to them I'd say exactly: "I understand — could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact or email for appeals so I have a record that I reached out?" 

I'm not sure I follow how that actually eases the shame in the moment — my hands are jittery just thinking about it. Can we roleplay them saying no again so I can try that line and see if it steadies me?

Therapist: Let's try the roleplay again. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

You can say to yourself: "I'm trying right now, and that counts." 

And then, you can say to the account manager: "I understand — could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact or email for appeals so I have a record that I reached out?"

I want to help you see what's happening when you make that connection between noticing the shame and taking action. When you say "I'm trying right now, and that counts" and then ask for the appeals contact, what's happening in your body that might be helping to calm the shame?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how that really fixes anything, but when I say "I'm trying right now, and that counts" and then ask for the appeals contact, I notice the tightness in my chest ease a little, my hands stop shaking so much, and my breath gets a bit deeper. My shoulders drop like I can actually stand myself for a second and my voice steadies enough to get the words out. It still feels fragile though—my mind's ready to dart away if they say no—so I worry it won't hold unless I get something concrete back.

Therapist: It sounds like when you make that connection between noticing the shame and taking action, your body actually starts to respond in a way that makes it a little more possible to stand up for yourself. The tightness in your chest eases, your hands stop shaking, and your breath gets a bit deeper. That's a small but important change.

It's understandable that you're worried it won't hold unless you get something concrete back. That's actually a really important part of what you're looking for: a record that you reached out and asked for options. If you can get that, it might help you feel more grounded and less anxious about what might happen next.

Let's try one more thing: what if, instead of waiting for something concrete to happen, you focused on what you're already doing right now? You're noticing the tightness in your chest, and you're making a connection between that and taking action. You're asking for the appeals contact, even though it's hard. What if, just for a moment, you could hold onto that small step, even if the outcome isn't what you expected?

Patient: Okay... I can try to hold onto that small step — when I say “I’m trying right now, and that counts,” my chest does loosen and my voice steadies a bit. But honestly, how is clinging to that feeling supposed to help me figure out what matters beyond being a social worker? It feels like a bandage on a bigger hole. Can we actually map one concrete thing I can do in the next hour that isn’t just more bills—something that helps me remember what I like or who I am outside work? And also, can we keep roleplaying the call a couple more times? I'm jittery and I need the practice.

Therapist: You're right that clinging to that feeling might not be enough to fill the bigger hole. What matters is that it's a small step towards noticing what matters to you.

Let's map one concrete thing you can do in the next hour that isn't just about bills. What if you did something that feels meaningful to you, even if it's just for 10-15 minutes? For example, what if you went for a short walk outside during your lunch break, or made a cup of tea that you really enjoy? Something small that brings you joy or makes you feel connected to what matters to you.

Now, let's keep roleplaying the call. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

You can say to yourself: "I'm trying right now, and that counts." 

And then, you can say to the account manager: "I understand — could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact or email for appeals so I have a record that I reached out?"

This time, I want you to notice what's happening in your body while you're making that connection between noticing the shame and taking action. What's changing physically?

Patient: When I say that line and ask for the appeals contact, my chest actually loosens a bit, my breathing slows, my hands stop shaking as much, and my jaw unclenches for a second. But I'm still jittery and my mind's darting—how is that supposed to stop me from freezing if they say no again? Can we keep roleplaying the call a few more times, and also pick one tiny thing I can do in the next hour—like a 15-minute walk or making a nice cup of tea—so I have something that's not bills to hang onto?

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the looseness in your chest, slowing of your breath, and stillness in your hands, it's a small window into what matters to you. Even if your mind is still darting, that looseness is there.

Let's keep roleplaying the call. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

You can say to yourself: "I'm trying right now, and that counts." 

And then, you can say to the account manager: "I understand — could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact or email for appeals so I have a record that I reached out?"

This time, I want you to notice what happens when they say "no" again. What's the smallest step you can take to keep moving forward?

Patient: When they say no, my chest tightens and my head wants to run — I'm not sure I follow how this stops the shame, but the smallest step I can actually manage is this: calmly ask for the rep’s name/ID and the appeals contact, then immediately send myself a short email (or write a quick note) with the date, time, rep name, and what they said so I have a record. After that, take a 10–15 minute walk or make a cup of tea to steady my hands and breath. I'm skeptical it’ll fix everything, but I’ll try — can we roleplay them saying "no" again so I can practice that exact line and then the quick email?

Therapist: When you notice the shame showing up again, that's a small step to notice it. And I love that you've found a way to take action that feels manageable to you - calmly asking for the rep's name and ID, and then taking a small moment to document what happened.

Let's roleplay the call again. I'll respond as the account manager.

"Sorry, we can't offer a payment plan at this time. Our policy is to require a minimum payment of X amount per month, and we're unable to make exceptions."

You can say to yourself: "I'm trying right now, and that counts." 

And then, you can say to the account manager: "I understand — could you please give me the name and ID of the person I'm speaking with and the best contact or email for appeals so I have a record that I reached out?"

And then, immediately after they say "no", you can say: "Thank you for your time. I'm going to send myself a note with the details of our conversation. *pauses* Okay, I just sent myself an email with the date, time, rep name, and what you said."

What happens to you when you take that small moment to document what happened, and then take a few minutes to walk or make tea?

Patient: When I actually write the note and then make a cup of tea or take a short walk, my chest loosens, my breath gets steadier, and my hands stop jittering so much — it gives me a tiny, concrete win that feels like proof I'm doing something. It calms the shame enough to think straight for a few minutes and remember I’m more than the bills, but I’m skeptical — it still feels temporary and the bigger questions about who I am beyond work rush back. Can we keep roleplaying the call a few more times? And give me one single, short line to say if they suddenly ask me to pay right now and I really can’t.
