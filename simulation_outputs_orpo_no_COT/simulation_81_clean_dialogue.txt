Patient: Lately I've been stuck on how my anger and frustration tend to flare up in family interactions — it feels like a cyclical feedback loop of perceived slights and old patterns rather than something I actually experience in the moment. I catch myself intellectualizing it, constructing theories about attachment, communication breakdowns, and intergenerational scripts so I don't have to sit with the raw hurt. I want to manage it better, but I keep defaulting to analysis instead of feeling, and that feels exhausting.

Therapist: It sounds like when those feelings of anger and frustration arise, your mind can get really caught up in trying to make sense of them, almost like you're protecting yourself from feeling the pain by figuring out what's "wrong" with your family or the situation. 

What would happen if, instead of trying to untangle all those thoughts and patterns, you simply noticed what's present with your body right now, like the tightness in your chest or the heaviness in your shoulders, without trying to fix it or make sense of it?

Patient: I think if I actually tuned into my body I'd notice a locked-in tightness in my chest, shallower breathing, maybe a knot in my stomach — basically somatic residues of old relational stress rather than a neat, new emotion. The problem is my brain immediately translates those sensations into narratives about attachment wounds and family scripts, which is my go-to protective strategy so I don't have to fully feel the discomfort. It feels draining and kind of scary to imagine staying with the physical stuff without turning it into analysis, and I'm not sure how I'd even begin to tolerate whatever shows up.

Therapist: That makes sense. It sounds like your brain is trying to protect you from the feeling of being overwhelmed by those old relational stress patterns. 

Would you be willing to try noticing that knot in your chest for just one moment, without trying to untangle it into a story about your family or attachment wounds? Just one small moment.

Patient: Okay, I'll try for one moment. I notice a tight, constricted feeling in my chest, my breath is shallow, my shoulders are up around my ears, and there's this flutter/knotted sensation in my stomach. Almost immediately my mind wants to turn it into a story about Mom's criticism and intergenerational patterns, and that pull makes me feel a bit overwhelmed — can we slow down? I don't really know how to sit with this without analyzing it.

Therapist: It's like your mind is trying to "fix" that knot in the chest, and that feels like too much right now. 

Can you notice that feeling of overwhelm, not as something you need to change or fix, but just as it is? Not as a story about your mom, but just as the physical sensation in your chest, your breath, your shoulders...

Patient: Okay — I can feel a tight, pressing band in my chest, my breath is shallow and clipped, and my shoulders are hunched up; there's a low, buzzy tension in my stomach too. Almost instantly my mind starts drafting a whole etiological narrative about who's to blame and why this pattern exists, which feels like an intellectual anesthetic. I'm trying to stay with the raw sensation, but it's already making me a bit panicky — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that narrative is already showing up, even as you're trying to notice the physical sensations. 

What would happen if you were to notice that "drafting narrative" itself, like a gentle hum in the background, while you stay with the physical sensations in your chest? Not as if you're trying to stop it, but just noticing it's there.

Patient: I can try that. Noticing the narrative as a background hum does make the chest tension feel a little less fused to my identity — like it's a phenomenon I could observe rather than be swallowed by. But almost immediately I start analyzing that hum itself — where it came from, whether it means I'm defective, whether I should fix it — so the "distance" just turns into another thing to ruminate on. Right now that makes me feel exposed and a bit shaky; can we slow down and stay with the chest for a moment longer?

Therapist: It sounds like that analysis is still showing up, even though you noticed the narrative as a background hum. 

Can you try to notice the analysis itself, without trying to change it or fix it. Just as it's happening, like a faint whisper in the corner of your mind. Not as if you're trying to silence it, but just noticing it's there.

Patient: Yeah — I can hear it, this low-level narration that's cataloging grievances and running causal hypotheses about who's at fault, like a sarcastic inner critic doing quick case studies. Noticing it makes the chest feel slightly less like a singular truth and more like one phenomenon among others, but of course that observation immediately spawns another layer of recursive meta-cognition where I start judging the judge. It's making me a little shaky and queasy — can we slow down and sit with the chest and that whisper for a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the noticing itself is creating a bit of a paradox. 

Can you try to sit with the chest and the whisper without trying to change them, not even by noticing the noticing. Just be with the sensation of the chest and the voice in your head, as if they were two separate things. Not "I'm noticing this," but just the sensation of the chest, and the voice saying "you're so critical."

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to let the chest be a tight, pressing band and the voice say "you're so critical" as two parallel phenomena, not folding them into a story. But even as I do, my mind immediately starts treating the voice as diagnostic data about my perfectionism and attachment scripts, so I'm kind of stuck observing my observation. That's making me feel a bit raw and shaky — can we slow down and stay with just the chest for a minute longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the observation itself is becoming the story again. 

Can you try to notice the voice saying "you're so critical" just as it's saying it, without asking yourself what it means about your perfectionism or attachment scripts. Not "what's going on here?" but just "that's what the voice is saying."

Patient: Okay — the voice says "you're so critical," just that, a clipped, familiar cadence, and I'm trying to let it be only a sound. But as soon as I notice it, my brain goes into a metacognitive loop, labeling it "inner critic," tracing origins, doing pattern analysis, and that immediately makes my chest tighten and my stomach flip. Can we slow down and stay with the chest for a bit? I'm feeling shaky and a little exposed.

Therapist: It sounds like the metacognitive loop is happening even as you're trying to stay with the chest. 

Can you try to notice the chest tightening and your stomach flipping without asking yourself what they mean or what the voice is saying. Not "why is my chest getting tight?" but just the sensation of the chest tightening, and the flipping of your stomach. Just as it is, without trying to change it or make sense of it.

Patient: I can feel the chest tighten like a constricting band and the stomach do this quick, queasy flip — just raw sensations for a moment. But my brain immediately wants to recode them as "anxious attachment" or "sympathetic arousal" and start a causal story, which makes me feel shaky and exposed; can we slow down and stay with the chest a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like the story is happening even as you're trying to notice the sensations. 

Can you try to notice the sensation of your brain wanting to recode the sensations as "anxious attachment" without trying to stop it. Just notice the thought "this is anxious attachment" as it comes up, like a whispered idea in the corner of your mind. Not as if you're trying to change it, but just as it is.

Patient: I can hear the whispered label—“this is anxious attachment”—it arrives like a clinical, tidy explanation that immediately distances me from the actual feeling. Noticing that thought makes me oddly relieved and alarmed at the same time; relieved because it gives a framework, alarmed because it feels like an anesthetic that numbs the ache, and my chest tightens and my stomach flips. I’m getting shaky and a bit defensive—can we slow down and stay with the chest and that whisper for a while?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is both giving you a sense of control and numbing the pain. 

Can you try to notice what's happening in your chest when you think "this is anxious attachment" - what's the sensation like when you hold onto that thought? Is it the tightness, the flipping stomach? Not the thought itself, but what happens when you notice that thought as it shows up.

Patient: When I label it "anxious attachment," the tight band in my chest sharpens into a concentrated pressure under my sternum, my breath clips even more, and my stomach does that cold, sinking flip — more focused, less diffuse. Paradoxically the cognitive label gives my thinking a little relief (it organizes the chaos) while the body seems to react by catapulting the tension into higher fidelity, which makes me feel oddly exposed and a bit panicky. Can we slow down and sit with that focused pressure for a minute longer?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is becoming a kind of anchor for the physical sensations, making them more intense. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you focus on the pressure under your sternum, without trying to change it or push it away. Just notice it as it is, with your breath still clipped and your stomach still flipping. Not "I'm anxious attachment," but "this pressure under my sternum."

Patient: When I focus, the pressure becomes this concentrated, almost pulsating weight under my sternum — my breath gets even shallower and there's a hot, tight ache that feels distinct from the vague discomfort I had before. Of course, my brain immediately anthropologizes it into narratives about Mom's criticism and intergenerational dynamics, which feels like a defensive reframe that numbs the rawness. That's making me a bit exposed and panicky — can we slow down and just stay with the pressure for a moment longer?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is happening again, trying to protect you from the feeling. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you let the pressure be there, just as it is, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Not "this is about Mom's criticism," but "this is the pressure under my sternum." Just the sensation of it, with your breath still clipped and your stomach still flipping.

Patient: Okay — when I let it be, there's this dense, sinking pressure under my sternum, a hot, pulsing weight, my breath stays shallow and my stomach does that queasy flip. Immediately my mind wants to reify it as somatic encoding of old relational hurts and start cataloging causal narratives, which ironically just amplifies the sensation. I'm feeling exposed and a bit panicky — can we slow down and stay with the pressure for a moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the thought is happening again, and it's making the sensation worse. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you don't try to make sense of it, or try to change it. Not "I should be able to handle this," but just the pressure under your sternum. Not "I'm so anxious," but the sensation of your breath being shallow and your stomach flipping.

Patient: Okay — when I try not to interpret it, the pressure is this dense, hot weight under my sternum, my breath stays shallow and my stomach does the queasy flip. But almost immediately my mind retrofits it into a somatic shorthand for intergenerational trauma and familial dynamics, which paradoxically makes me feel exposed and a little ashamed. I'm getting shaky and overwhelmed—can we slow down and stay with the sensation a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought is still showing up, and it's making you feel exposed. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you let the thought be there, without trying to push it away or change it. Not "I'm ashamed," but the queasy flip in your stomach. Not "I should be able to handle this," but the dense weight under your sternum. Just the sensations, without judgment.

Patient: Okay — letting the thought be, I notice the queasy flip in my stomach as a hollow, rolling sensation and the dense weight under my sternum like a hot, compact stone; my breath stays shallow around it. Even as I observe, my mind almost reflexively reclassifies them into neat diagnostic categories (shame, anxious attachment), which makes me feel exposed, shaky, and a bit panicky. Can we slow down and stay with these sensations a little longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the thought is still happening, and it's making you feel exposed. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you don't try to fit them into those categories. Not "I'm ashamed," but the queasy flip in your stomach. Not "I'm anxious attachment," but the weight under your sternum. Just the sensations, without trying to make sense of them.

Patient: When I try not to name them, it’s just a hollow, rolling flip in my stomach and a hot, compact weight under my sternum; my breath stays clipped around those sensations. Even as I hold them, there's this quick flare of shame and simmering frustration that makes me want to start explaining or defending myself—like I failed at whatever internal standard I have—and that immediately tightens the chest. I'm shaky and kind of furious with myself about getting like this; can we slow down and just stay with the sensations a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like that shame and frustration are showing up, and it's making you feel stuck. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you notice the shame and frustration, not to make them go away, but just to see them. Not "I'm so ashamed," but the tightness in your chest. Not "I'm a failure," but the queasy flip in your stomach. Just the sensations, while you're holding them.

Patient: When I notice the shame and frustration, my chest clamps down into a hot, constricting band, my breath gets pinched, and my stomach does that hollow, rolling flip — there's even a prickly heat behind my throat. Almost immediately a self-critical monologue starts cataloguing perceived failures and rehearsing defenses, which numbs the rawness while making me embarrassed and quietly furious at myself; can we slow down and sit with those sensations a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like that self-critical monologue is happening again, and it's making you feel numb and embarrassed. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you let the self-critical thoughts be there, without trying to push them away or change them. Not "I'm such a failure," but the hot, constricting band in your chest. Not "I'm so stupid," but the prickly heat behind your throat. Just the sensations, while you're holding them.

Patient: I can feel the hot, constricting band across my chest, my breath pinched, a prickly heat behind my throat and that hollow, rolling flip in my stomach — it's all so physical. Almost immediately a shame-laden self-critique starts cataloguing past failings and rehearsing defenses, which makes me flush with embarrassment and quietly furious at myself; can we slow down and sit with these sensations a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the shame and self-criticism are really showing up, and they're making you feel so physically tight and uncomfortable. 

Can you try to notice what happens when you let those sensations be there, not to make them go away, but just to see what's happening in your body. Not "I'm such a failure," but the hot band in your chest. Not "I'm so stupid," but the prickly heat behind your throat. Just the sensations, while you're holding them.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "letting them be" supposed to actually change anything when they feel so raw? When I try, the hot constricting band and hollow flip stay exactly the same, and a corrosive shame and frustration spikes like I failed at even being here, which makes me tense and irritated with myself. It all starts to feel paradoxical and a bit absurdly meta — can we slow down and stay with the sensations a moment longer?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "let them be" feels like a way to avoid the pain, but it's not actually working. 

Can you try to notice what's happening when you're trying to avoid the pain - what's that sensation like when you're tensing up and getting irritated with yourself? Not "I should be able to handle this," but just the feeling of your chest getting tighter. Not "I'm a failure," but the hollow flip in your stomach. Just the sensations, while you're holding them.

Patient: When I tense up and try to avoid it, my chest coils like a tightened spring—breath shallow, sternum aching—and my stomach does that hollow, rolling flip with a queasy knot. My jaw clenches, hands go a bit cold, and there's this prickly, shame-tinged heat that spikes like I failed at even being here, which immediately propels me into explaining or defending instead of sitting. The body feels unbearably vivid and the mind rushes to anesthetize it with theories, which just makes me more irritated with myself. Can we slow down and stay with the chest for a moment?

Therapist: It sounds like that tension is really intensifying when you try to avoid it. 

Can you try to notice what's happening to your body when the chest feels like it's "coiling like a tightened spring" - what's that sensation like in your breath, your jaw, your hands? Not "I'm so tense," but what's actually happening in your body when you feel that tightness.

Patient: Physically, my breathing gets shallow and rapid—tiny high-chest sips with the exhales cut off. My jaw clenches so tight my molars ache, my hands curl into quiet fists and go a bit cold, and my shoulders hike up toward my ears while my pulse thumps in my neck. Almost immediately my mind starts narrating it as another failure and gears into defense, which just layers shame on the tension—can we slow down and stay with the chest a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are really strong right now. 

Can you try to notice what happens to the tension in your chest when you notice it - not as "another failure," but just what's happening in your chest when you feel it. Not trying to change it, but just noticing it as you do.

Patient: When I focus on it the tension kind of concretizes — a hot, dense band under my sternum that pulses with each tiny, clipped inhale, my throat tightens and my hands go cold. Noticing it paradoxically seems to ratchet it up, and that quick flare of shame and irritation hits — like I'm failing at even being present — which immediately drives me toward explaining or analyzing to escape the rawness. I'm shaky and annoyed at myself for that; can we slow down and just sit with the chest a bit longer?

Therapist: It sounds like the tension is really showing up when you notice it. 

Can you try to notice what's happening to your body when you're thinking "I'm failing at even being present" - what's that feeling like in your chest, in your throat, in your hands? Not as a judgment, but just what's happening physically when you think that thought.

Patient: When I think "I'm failing at even being present," my chest contracts into a hot, dense band under my sternum and my breathing gets very shallow and clipped. My throat tightens like there's a lump, my jaw clenches, and my hands curl a bit into cold, slightly numb fists with a tingling at the fingertips. Even saying that, my mind starts turning it into evidence of failure and I get embarrassed and defensive—can we slow down and just sit with these sensations for a moment?

Therapist: It sounds like that thought is really triggering the physical sensations. 

Can you try to notice what happens to the sensations in your body when you're feeling that thought - not the thought itself, but what's happening to your chest, throat, jaw, hands. Not "I'm failing," but what's actually happening in your body when you think that.

Patient: Physically, the thought makes my chest clamp into a dense, hot band under my sternum and my breaths get tiny and clipped, like I'm not getting enough air. My throat tightens into a lump, my jaw clenches until my molars throb, my hands curl into cold, slightly numb fists with a tingling at the tips, and my shoulders hitch up; my heart feels a little sped up and there's a prickly heat behind my eyes. Of course my mind then spins that into a narrative about failing, which only seems to escalate the bodily stuff — can we slow down and just stay with what's happening in the body for a minute?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are really intense right now. 

Can you try to notice what happens to the sensations in your body when you notice them - not as "I'm failing," but just what's happening in your chest, throat, jaw, hands. Not trying to change them, but just noticing them as they are. Like you said, when you notice the sensations, they seem to get a little worse. What happens to the sensations if you notice them just as they are, without trying to change them or push them away?

Patient: When I try to notice them without changing them they actually seem to intensify — the band under my sternum sharpens, my breaths get tinier, my throat tightens, my hands go cold, and there's that prickly heat behind my eyes. It's like a hypervigilant, interoceptive amplification where simply observing becomes feedback that ramps the physiology, and then my brain launches into a meta-loop cataloguing the "failure" of being present. I'm shaky and a bit furious with myself about that — can we slow down and sit with the chest for a minute?

Therapist: It sounds like the physical sensations are becoming even more intense when you try to notice them without changing them. 

Can you try to notice what happens to the sensations when you notice them, not just as "I'm failing" or "this is bad," but just as they are. Not trying to change them, but just noticing them as they are. Like you said, the brain is launching into a meta-loop. What happens if you just let the loop be, without trying to stop it? Not trying to change the thoughts, but just letting them be there, as you notice the sensations in your body.

Patient: When I let the loop be, it initially ramps up—the band under my sternum tightens, breath gets tinier, my hands go cold, and the inner monologue keeps looping like static. After a bit it paradoxically fades into a background hum I could, in theory, sit beside, but my reflexive response is immediate analysis of that very shift and a hot spike of shame and irritation at myself for having to do that. Noticing without pushing helps a little, but I'm still shaky and kind of furious at myself for needing to narrate it—can we slow down and just stay with the chest for a minute?
