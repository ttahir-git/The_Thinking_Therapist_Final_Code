Patient: Lately I've been caught in repetitive cycles of harsh self-criticism — I tend to interpret almost every minor setback as proof of some fundamental personal failure. I grew up in a stable but emotionally reserved family, and I suspect that lack of modeled emotional expression left me with this internalized censor that defaults to judgment rather than compassion. Being unemployed now and facing an empty nest has amplified it, and I find myself talking about my feelings analytically instead of actually feeling them.

Therapist: It sounds like the self-criticism feels like a fundamental part of who you are right now, and that it's especially hard to access feelings when you're not sure how to make room for them. What would it be like for you to notice that judgment story when it shows up – not to stop it, but just to notice it as it does – while you were sitting there talking about feeling stuck?

Patient: I guess I’d likely convert it into a meta-narrative—label the judgment as an entrenched cognitive script or internal editor that kicks in whenever I perceive failure. Naming it gives me a bit of distance, but it also tends to anesthetize the feeling, so I start mapping family dynamics and psychological theories instead of admitting there’s actually sadness or shame under it. If I tried to notice the story while sitting with the stuckness, I’d feel a tightness in my chest and a tendency to deflect into explanation rather than stay with the uncomfortable sensations.

Therapist: So when that tightness and deflection show up, you're already caught in a cycle of trying to make sense of it – even while you notice the story as a script. What if, for just a breath's worth, you could make space for that tightness without trying to explain it, not even to yourself?

Patient: Okay—I can try that, though trying already sounds like another project to analyze. When I actually soften into it for a breath, there's a tightness and a kind of low hum in my chest and throat, and my first impulse is to narrate it away with labels and theories. I'm trying to stay with the sensation instead of explaining it, but I notice my mouth wants to keep talking about the talking.

Therapist: The "my mouth wants to keep talking" feels like a familiar pattern. What would happen to the tightness and hum in your chest if you didn't have to be the one talking about it – even just for that breath?

Patient: If I actually let myself stop explaining for that breath, the tightness loosens a notch — like a small hollow behind my sternum and a softer, achey warmth in my throat. The quiet is oddly relieving and also a little terrifying, like dropping a rehearsed script and finding a blank I don't know how to inhabit. Almost instantly my mouth wants to fill that blank with theories and explanations, so I notice that slight easing and the immediate urge to narrate it away.

Therapist: The easing and the ache in your throat sound like a tiny opening – a small crack in the armor. What if, instead of trying to fill that space with stories, you could just rest with the ache for a moment – not to fix it, but just to notice it as it is, in the midst of that quiet?

Patient: If I actually rest with it, the ache becomes more distinct — a dull pressure under my sternum and a lump that wants to move toward tears. Almost immediately my mind goes into metacognitive overdrive, cataloguing triggers and family scripts, turning the sensation into data so I don't have to feel the shame. I'm trying to stay with the feeling but there's a small panic that if I don't explain it away I'll be overwhelmed, so can we slow down a bit? I'm having trouble not narrating; it feels safer to analyze than to sit in the quiet.

Therapist: The cataloging feels like a familiar defense – it's like you're trying to contain the panic by making sense of it. What if, instead of trying to "contain" it, you could just notice the panic *while* the ache is still there – not to stop it, but to see it as part of what's happening right now?

Patient: I can try, although my instinct is to turn it into a clinical vignette so I don't have to feel it. When I hold both, the panic is a hot, quick tightening that makes my breath shallow and my hands feel a bit buzzy, while the ache stays like a hollow under my sternum — it's oddly sharp and heavy at the same time. I want to start explaining why this is happening, but I also notice a fragile curiosity; can we slow down and just sit with those two sensations for a bit?

Therapist: The hot tightening and the hollow ache are like two separate things – the panic is like a flash of light, while the ache is a quiet weight. What if you could just notice that flash of panic while it's still there, without trying to make sense of it – just to see what happens if you leave the explanation-making for now?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice the flash without explaining it. It's a sharp, hot spike behind my sternum, my breath catches and my hands tingle; if I actually let it be, it peaks and then eases a little. Almost instantly my mind wants to slap a label on it — "amygdala reaction," "family conditioning" — so can we slow down? I'm afraid if I don't explain it'll swell, but there's a tiny curiosity too.

Therapist: The labeling feels like a reflex – you're already reaching for a way to make sense of it. What if you could just notice the labeling as it happens, without trying to change it or make it go away?

Patient: When I notice the labeling, it's like there's a running commentary in my head — an internal editor that translates sensation into theories and diagnoses so I don't have to actually feel anything. Observing that narrator gives a curious kind of distance, like cognitive scaffolding, but it also tends to deaden the rawness and make me more of an analyst than a person in the moment. If I try to just notice the labeling without changing it, there's a slight relief, but also this anxious anticipation that the un-narrated feeling will surge, so can we slow down and sit with that split for a bit?

Therapist: The relief when you notice the labeling is a small victory – it's like you're giving yourself permission to hold the discomfort. What if you could find that permission while still holding the anxiety that it might overwhelm you – not to change it, but to see what it's like to be with it in the midst of noticing the labeling?

Patient: I can imagine giving myself that permission—intellectually it even feels a bit like unhooking a clasp, but the anxiety that it'll swell into something unmanageable stays very real. When I try it, there's a slight loosening in my chest and a tightening in my throat while my mind immediately drafts family scripts and worst-case scenarios, so can we slow down and actually sit with that tension for a while?

Therapist: The loosening in your chest and the tightening in your throat are like two separate things – the loosening is like a small opening, while the tightening is like a warning signal. What if you could notice the warning signal *while* the opening is still there – not to try to change it, but to see what happens if you could hold both together?

Patient: If I actually try to hold both, I notice the opening as a slight slackening behind my sternum — a small, almost embarrassed relief — while the warning signal tightens my throat and makes my breath skim the surface. My reflex is to translate that into a causal narrative about upbringing and cognitive defenses, which deadens it, but underneath that there's a low curiosity and a simmering fear that it will get bigger if I don't explain it. Can we slow down and sit with that split for a minute? I want to stay, but my mouth keeps drafting theories.

Therapist: The curiosity is a small flame – it's not trying to fix anything, just noticing what's happening. The fear that it will get bigger is like a shadow – it's not the flame itself. What if you could notice the shadow *while* the flame is still burning – not to try to push it away, but to see what happens if you let the flame be there, even with the shadow nearby?

Patient: Okay — the flame-and-shadow image makes sense to me conceptually; I can hold the curiosity and the fear as coexisting. Right now though my chest just tightened and my breath got a little shallow, and my attention is skittering — I feel hypervigilant and jumpy, like there's an urge to move or explain instead of just sit. My usual reflex is to theorize about attachment schemas and cognitive defenses, which would anesthetize it, but I also feel a genuine physical urge to do something. Can we slow down and do a very short—thirty seconds to a minute—exercise where I just name the flame and the shadow in my body without narrating? I need help staying with it.

Therapist: Let's do that exercise. I'll guide you for thirty seconds. When you notice your chest tightening and your breath getting shallow, just notice those sensations *without trying to change them*. See if you can notice them in your body, like they're happening right now, without trying to fix them. Then, without changing the sensations, *name the flame and the shadow in your body*. Just say it to yourself, quietly, "There's a small, curious flame burning in my chest, and there's a shadow of fear nearby." What happens when you say that?

Patient: Okay — I said it quietly to myself: "There's a small, curious flame burning in my chest, and there's a shadow of fear nearby." Saying it softened the sternum a hair, but then my breath skimmed and my attention went skittering; my hands feel buzzy and my heart's picking up. My reflex is already narrativizing — drafting family scripts and diagnostic-sounding labels — so I'm having trouble not turning this into analysis; can we slow down and do another very short thirty seconds where you just prompt me to name whatever's in my body so I don't get pulled away?

Therapist: Let's do another thirty seconds. When you notice your breath skimming or your hands feeling buzzy, *name the sensations in your body, without trying to change them*. Just say it to yourself, quietly: "There's something in my chest that's making my breath catch..." or "I'm feeling something in my hands..." What happens when you say that, without trying to analyze it?

Patient: I said, "There's something in my chest that's making my breath catch," and "My hands feel buzzy, my heart's racing." Saying it eased the sternum for a beat, but then my breath got thinner and my attention started skittering — my pulse picked up and my mouth wanted to start explaining it all away. I keep sliding into family narratives and clinical labels which just deaden the moment; can we slow down and do another very short prompt where you cue me to name whatever's in my body so I don't get pulled into analysis?

Therapist: Let's do another thirty seconds. When you notice your pulse picking up or your breath getting thinner, *name the sensations in your body without trying to change them*. Just say to yourself: "I'm noticing my heart racing..." or "My breath feels tight in my chest..." What happens when you say that, without trying to fix it or analyze it?

Patient: When I said, "I'm noticing my heart racing and my breath tight in my chest," it did calm the sternum for a beat, but now my attention is fracturing — my thoughts are cataloguing causes and running through family scripts. My hands are buzzy, my jaw's clenched, and there's this jittery, anxious energy making me feel distractible and on edge. My mouth already wants to translate it into a theory to feel safe; can we slow down and do a very short grounding cue or another gentle prompt to keep me from spiraling into analysis?

Therapist: It sounds like the calm was short-lived, and the fracturing is happening again. When you notice your thoughts cataloging causes, *name the sensation of that thought in your body, without trying to change it*. Say to yourself: "That story about 'why I'm feeling this way' is making my jaw feel tight." What happens when you just notice that tightness, without trying to fix it or analyze it?

Patient: When I do that, the cataloguing shows up as a literal clench in my jaw — a tight, grinding pressure that shoots to my temples and down my neck, and my breath gets shallow and quick. Noticing it out loud loosens it for a beat, but almost immediately my mind layers a running commentary — hypotheses about upbringing, a litany of self-blame — so I feel pulled between the raw ache and the urge to explain it away. Can we slow down and do another very brief prompt where you cue me to name only the physical sensation again? I need a simple anchor before the analysis takes over.

Therapist: Let's try another brief prompt. When you notice the breath getting shallow and the jaw clenching, *name only the physical sensation in your jaw*. Just say: "My jaw is tight" or "I feel the pressure there." No thinking, no analyzing – just noticing the physical sensation itself.

Patient: My jaw is tight — a hard, grinding clench across my molars with pressure into my temples and down my neck. The tightness feels shame-laced and prickly with frustration, and I'm already wanting to explain it away — can we slow down?

Therapist: When you notice the shame-laced frustration, *name the tightness again, without trying to change it*. Say to yourself: "The tightness is still there, even with the shame." What happens when you just notice it, without trying to fix it or analyze it?

Patient: When I just notice it, the tightness stays stubbornly present — a hard clamp across my jaw that radiates into my temples and down my neck, with this hot, shame-laced prickliness that makes me want to shrink. Naming it loosens the clamp a hair, then my breath skims and my attention splinters into that familiar litany of explanations and self-blame. I'm feeling jumpy and distracted right now, like I want to move or talk my way out of it, so can we slow down and do another very brief prompt where you just cue me to name the sensation one more time? I need that simple anchor before my head takes over.

Therapist: Let's try again. When you notice your breath skimming and your attention splintering, *name the sensation in your jaw again*. Just say: "My jaw is tight" or "I feel the clamp there." No thinking, no analyzing – just noticing the physical sensation itself.

Patient: My jaw is tight — a hard clamp across my molars, pressure into my temples and down my neck, prickly and shame-laced. Saying that eases it a hair, but my mind is already drafting explanations; can we slow down and do one more very short naming so I don't get pulled into analysis?

Therapist: Let's try one more time. When you notice the mind drafting explanations, *name the sensation in your jaw again*. Say to yourself: "My jaw is tight" or "I feel the pressure there".

Patient: My jaw is tight — a hard clamp across my molars, pressure into my temples and down my neck, prickly and shame-laced. Saying that loosens it a hair, but my internal editor's already drafting meta-explanations to anesthetize it and I'm jittery and frustrated, so can we slow down and do one more very brief naming prompt so I don't get pulled into the narrative?

Therapist: Let's try to stay with the naming just for one more breath. When you notice the meta-explanations starting, *name the sensation in your jaw again*. Just say: "My jaw is tight" without adding any extra thoughts.

Patient: "My jaw is tight." Saying it eases the clamp a hair, but I'm jittery and my head's already spinning into explanations and self-blame — the tightness feels shame-laced and prickly. Can we slow down and do one more short naming prompt or a simple grounding cue? I need help staying with it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to getting back to that tightness. When you notice your head spinning into explanations, *notice where your feet are on the ground*. Just feel the weight of your body on the chair or floor, without trying to change it.

Patient: My feet feel planted — a dull, steady pressure through the heels and balls of my feet, and the chair bearing my weight. That actually grounds me a smidge, but my jaw's still clenched and my breath is shallow and my mind's already slipping into metacognitive loops, cataloguing causes to avoid the shame that's prickling under it. I'm feeling anxious and a bit frustrated by how quickly I detach into explanation — can we slow down and do a very brief body-scan prompt from my feet up so I have something simple to follow?

Therapist: Let's try a brief body-scan. Starting with your feet, *notice the dull, steady pressure*. Now, slowly bring your attention up through your body, noticing any sensations without trying to change them. Notice the weight of your chair, the sensation of the air on your skin, the movement of your breath. *Notice your chest, your shoulders, your jaw, your face*.

Patient: Okay — starting at my feet: there's that dull, steady pressure through my heels and the balls of my feet, a grounded but slightly numb sensation. Moving up my calves and thighs feels heavy, like gravity's a bit thicker there; the chair is bearing my weight in a steady, unremarkable way. The air on my skin is cool and slightly prickly; my breath is shallow, more in my upper chest than my belly. In my chest there's that familiar tightness — a shame-laced, prickly hollow behind the sternum — my shoulders are high and my jaw's clenched, temples buzzing. I'm already noticing my mind drafting explanations to avoid it, so can we slow down and do a single, slow inhale together or a hand-to-heart cue so I have a concrete anchor to stay with?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really noticing the sensations in your body. Let's focus on the sensation of the breath. *Take a slow, deep inhale together*. As you inhale, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body, the rise of your chest, the expansion of your lungs. *Hold the breath for a moment*. And then, as you exhale, notice the sensation of the breath moving out of your body, the drop of your chest, the relaxation of your lungs. *Take another slow, deep inhale*.

Patient: I took the inhale — chest rose and my lungs felt a cool, full stretch; holding it felt oddly precarious. On the exhale the sternum eased a hair, then a sharp sting of shame and frustration flickered up, my heart sped and my head immediately went into metacognitive mode, drafting family scripts and causal narratives to anesthetize it. My hands are buzzy and my jaw's clenched; can we slow down and do a hand‑to‑heart for a few breaths or an extended exhale (like 6–8 seconds) together? I really need a concrete anchor so I don't slip back into explaining everything away.

Therapist: It sounds like the calm was brief. Let's try to anchor it. *Place your hand gently on your heart*. Feel the weight of your hand on your chest, the sensation of your palm on your skin. *Notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body*. Now, I want you to imagine a wave of calmness rising up from your heart, filling your entire body. *Take a slow, deep exhale together*, holding it for 6 seconds. As you exhale, imagine that calmness spreading through your body, filling your chest, your shoulders, your jaw. *Take another slow, deep inhale*.

Patient: I placed my hand on my heart — it felt warm and a little grounding, and the imagined wave did spread a bit. On that long exhale my sternum eased for a moment, then a sharp sting of shame and frustration shot up and my breath went shallow again; my hands are buzzy and my jaw's clenched. My head immediately started drafting family scripts and causal narratives to anesthetize it, so can we slow down and do another very slow, guided exhale together — you count the seconds and I follow — or give me a simple tactile anchor to keep me from slipping into analysis?

Therapist: It sounds like the calm was fleeting again. Let's try a slow exhale together. *Count the seconds with me*: "1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8..." *As you exhale, imagine any tension in your body releasing with each number*. Take your time, and when you're ready, slowly bring your attention back to your breath.

Patient: I followed your count — on that long exhale my sternum eased for a beat, a small, thin relief. But shame and frustration surged right after, my breath went shallow, my jaw clenched, and my mind immediately started over-intellectualizing everything to avoid the feeling. Can we do one more very slow, guided exhale with you counting slowly while I keep my hand on my heart? I need that simple anchor so I don't get pulled into the narrative.

Therapist: It sounds like the relief was brief. Let's try again. *Count the seconds with me*: "1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8..." *As you exhale, notice the sensation of your hand on your heart, the weight of your palm on your chest*. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes and look around the room. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Take your time.

Patient: I opened my eyes and looked around; the ordinary room grounded me for a beat, then that sharp sting of shame and frustration punched back in — my breath skimmed, my jaw clenched, and my attention started rehearsing past failures in a metacognitive loop. The hand-on-heart helped a hair, but I'm jittery and distracted and already drafting explanations to anesthetize it. Can we slow down and do one very simple, concrete anchor — you count a slow exhale for me (4–6 seconds) while I keep my hand on my heart, or we do a feet‑into‑floor grounding — I need that to stay with the feeling instead of narrating it away.
