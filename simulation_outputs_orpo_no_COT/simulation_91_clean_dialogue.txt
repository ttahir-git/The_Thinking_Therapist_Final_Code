Patient: Hi—I'm an older student, and since a recent health scare I've been having trouble managing anger and frustration, especially in conversations about it. My mind turns into this fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster—I picture the doctors missing something, my health collapsing, me failing out and ending up alone—and I get completely hooked on those stories like they're inevitable.

Therapist: Those stories can feel so real, like they're showing up right in front of you. When you notice that fortune-telling machine spinning up—what happens when you make room for it to be there, without trying to stop it?

Patient: When I try to make room for it, it doesn't calm — it gets louder and more insistent. My mind spins out a chain: the doctor will miss something, the tests won't catch it, my health will collapse, I'll flunk out and end up alone — and I get totally hooked like that's definitely the future. My body tenses, my voice gets sharp, and I either snap at whoever's asking or shut down, and when someone suggests other outcomes I just think that's unrealistic.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to make room for that machine—when it gets louder—you're still trying to control it, even though it's not working. What if, instead of trying to stop the thoughts, you could notice the tension in your body while they're still spinning?

Patient: I try to do that, but noticing the tension feels like adding fuel — my chest tightens, my hands clench, my breathing gets shallow, and the disaster story just gets louder. Observing it feels like proof it's real, like paying attention will make the doctors miss something for sure. I don't know how to hold the tension and the thought without snapping or shutting down.

Therapist: It feels like noticing the tension would actually make things worse. What if, instead of focusing on the thought or the tension, you could try to see the room around it—a little bit wider?

Patient: I try that, but the “wider room” just fills up with more proof that the worst will happen — missed scans, slipping grades, friends drifting away — so instead of calming it, it gives me more horror scenes to obsess over. My chest tightens, I get snappy or I shut down, and honestly it just makes me feel more stuck and annoyed, like imagining anything else is unrealistic.

Therapist: Those horror scenes can be really convincing. When you notice the room filling up with more proof, what happens if you could lean into the tightness in your chest, just for a tiny bit, while those scenes are still showing up?

Patient: I tried leaning into it once, but it felt like pouring fuel on the machine—my chest tightened more, my breathing got jagged, and the disaster chain just got louder: missed diagnosis, failing out, ending up alone. When that happens I either snap and yell or I shut down completely, and I can't make myself believe the idea that maybe it's not true — that just seems naive.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to lean into the tightness, it feels like it's fueling the machine even more. What if, instead of trying to stop it or make it go away, you could ask yourself what matters to you in that moment—what matters about staying with that tightness, and what matters about trying to believe something else?

Patient: I guess staying with the tightness feels like staying vigilant — like if I let up I'll get blindsided, so it's my way of staying in control. If I tried to believe in a different outcome I'd get some relief, maybe actually study and not snap at people, but that feels naive and like pretending while the doctors miss something. I know that's irrational, but I can't make myself accept those softer possibilities — they just don't seem real.

Therapist: Staying vigilant feels like protecting you from getting blindsided. It's like that tightness is your way of keeping yourself safe. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you could ask yourself what matters most about being in that moment, even if the doctors do miss something—what matters about showing up for your own learning, and for the people who care about you?

Patient: I guess what matters is not turning into the person who gives up—showing up means I might actually keep my grades, not be a burden, and not lose the few people who care. But I'm so stuck — even when I try to show up my mind says the doctors will miss something, I'll collapse, I'll flunk and end up alone, so I stay wired and snap or shut down. I'm tired of being caught between wanting to protect myself and feeling like any softer possibility is just naive.

Therapist: It sounds like showing up for yourself matters deeply, but the fear of missing something is really strong. When that fear shows up, what would it be like to notice it, not as the truth, but just as the thought it is—like noticing the word "will collapse" as a thought, rather than a prediction?

Patient: When I try to call "will collapse" just a thought, it doesn't shrink — pointing at it makes it feel more real, like I'm proving it. My chest tightens, I get snappy or shut down, and I can't make myself accept that it's only a thought; that feels naive. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It can feel like proving the thought is what matters, even when you're trying to notice it as just a thought. When you feel overwhelmed, what's one tiny step you could take right now, not to change the thought or make it go away, but just to show up with what matters to you in this moment?

Patient: I could set a five-minute timer and make myself read one page of my notes—just a tiny, concrete thing to show up for school even if the fortune-telling starts. I don't know if it'll help—feels a bit naive—but I'm tired of being stuck, so I'm willing to try that right now.

Therapist: That's a tiny, concrete step to show up for school. When you set the timer, what would it be like to notice the fortune-telling stories showing up, not as something that matters, but just as they are—without trying to change them?

Patient: If I try to notice them "just as they are," it feels like shining a spotlight on the machine and it roars louder — my chest tightens, my hands clench, my breathing gets jagged, and the awful chain of events just scrolls faster. I can maybe force myself to read a page with a timer, but it's like doing it through a storm and afterwards I'm wired and snappy. I get that you're asking me to notice, but it still feels naive — like pretending — and I don't know how to stop those stories from ruling me even when I look at them.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing them "just as they are" feels like trying to tame the storm, rather than letting it be there while you focus on something else. What if, instead of trying to stop the storm, you could try to notice what matters to you while it's still there—what matters about showing up for school, even if the stories are loud?

Patient: What matters is not becoming the person who gives up—I want to keep my grades, stay independent, and not be a burden to the few people who care. But even as I say that, the fortune-telling machine screams it's pointless—the doctors will miss something, I'll collapse, I'll flunk out anyway and end up alone—so showing up feels like pretending. I'm tired of this loop and I don't know how to hold the fear and what matters at the same time.

Therapist: It sounds like the machine is really loud right now, and it feels like it's winning. When you notice that the machine is screaming "it's pointless," what would it be like to notice that thought *while* you're still trying to show up for what matters to you?

Patient: If I try to notice "it's pointless" while I keep trying to study, it feels like stabbing at the engine — my chest tightens and the machine screams even louder that I'm wasting my energy. Sometimes I can force myself to keep going for a few minutes, but afterward I'm exhausted and snappy, and the fortune-teller says I only delayed the collapse. I don't know how to hold both the fear and what matters without it feeling like I'm lying to myself. How am I supposed to notice the thought without making it prove itself?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that thought *while* you're trying to study feels like trying to cut through the engine's noise. When you notice that you're getting stuck in that loop, what if, instead of trying to stop the machine, you could try to notice what's happening when you try to hold the thought *and* what matters to you?

Patient: When I try to hold the thought and what matters at the same time, my chest tightens, the machine roars that the doctors missed something and everything will fall apart, and I either snap at someone or shut down completely. Trying to notice the thought feels like I'm proving it—paying attention makes it more real—so I get exhausted and stuck between guarding myself and wanting to believe something softer, which just feels naive. I'm getting overwhelmed again — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought is actually making it more real for you, rather than less. When you feel overwhelmed, what's one tiny thing you could do to *move* your body while the thought is still there—like taking a deep breath, or noticing the sensation in your feet on the ground?

Patient: I could try three slow, deep belly breaths and really press my feet into the floor for thirty seconds—maybe wiggle my toes and feel the weight shift. But honestly I'm jittery and distracted, and when I do that my chest still tightens and the machine just screams louder that it's pointless, so I can't tell if it's helping or just a brief lie I tell myself.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that even trying to move your body while noticing the thought might just make it worse. When you say "I'm jittery and distracted," what matters to you right then—what would it be like to notice that you're still showing up for school, even if your body is still feeling tight?

Patient: What matters is that I don't become the person who gives up — keeping my routine, keeping my grades, and not becoming a burden to the few people who care. Even saying that my chest tightens, my hands shake, and my head is immediately full of the worst: missed diagnosis, failing out, ending up alone — so trying to “show up” feels like pretending. I can press my feet into the floor and take a breath, but the machine just screams louder and I get more wired and annoyed, like I'm wasting energy. I don't know how to hold the goal and the fear at once without the disaster story taking over.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought *while* you're trying to hold the goal is actually making it harder for you to show up. When you say that trying to "show up" feels like pretending, what would it be like to notice that thought *as a thought*, without trying to change it or make it true?

Patient: When I try to call "pretending" just a thought, it doesn't shrink — it feels like I'm proving it's true and the fortune-telling machine screams even louder. My chest tightens, my hands clench, my breathing gets shallow, and I'm jittery and can't focus on anything; saying it's "just a thought" feels naive, like I'm blinding myself to the collapse that's coming. I can't seem to hold that label and actually calm down — it just fuels the disaster story and leaves me wired and snappy.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought *as a thought* still makes you feel like you're proving its truth. When you say that noticing it makes you feel jittery and can't focus, what would it be like to notice that feeling *right now*, not as a problem to be solved, but just as it is?

Patient: If I try to notice the jitteriness right now, my chest tightens, my hands tremble, and the fortune-telling machine immediately starts narrating: missed diagnosis, tests that fail, my health collapsing, me flunking out and ending up alone — and that narration drowns out everything else. Saying "just notice" feels like feeding it; the more I look, the louder it gets, and I get scattered and irritable. I'm having a hard time staying with it without snapping or shutting down, and honestly I'm overwhelmed—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the jitteriness is actually making it worse. When you say that noticing it feels like feeding the machine and making it louder, what would it be like to notice that feeling *when the machine is already making a lot of noise*—not just when you're trying to notice it?

Patient: When the machine's already screaming, trying to notice the feeling just hands it more fuel — my chest clamps, my hands go numb, and the script speeds up: missed tests, a diagnosis too late, my health collapsing, me failing out and losing the few people who stick around. I can't hold the feeling and what matters at the same time; I either snap or shut down, and "noticing" just feels like proving the story. I'm jittery and scattered right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the feeling while the machine is already loud is too hard. When you say you're jittery and scattered, what matters to you right now—what would it be like to *move towards that matter* while still being where you are?

Patient: What matters is not becoming the person who gives up—keeping my grades, staying independent, and not being a burden. Moving toward that right now would be something tiny I can actually do while jittery: press my feet into the floor, do three slow belly breaths, then set a two‑minute timer and force myself to read one page. I think it's probably naive and the machine is already yelling that it's pointless, but I'm so scattered I can at least try that—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try that tiny step, even though it feels naive. When you say "the machine is already yelling that it's pointless," what would it be like to notice that thought *as a thought*, not as a proof of the story?

Patient: It doesn't work — calling it "just a thought" feels like validating it, and the machine immediately lists missed diagnoses, failed tests, my health collapsing, me flunking out and ending up alone; my chest tightens and my hands are shaking so badly I can't focus. I could try to say it's only a thought, but that feels like pretending and just fuels the story, so I don't know how to actually notice it without it winning. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought as "just a thought" feels like a losing battle. When you're not able to notice it as just a thought, what would happen if you tried to make room for it *as it is*, not as a proof of the story?

Patient: Making room for it just feels like giving it permission to take over — the more I let it be, the louder the machine screams: missed diagnosis, my health collapsing, me failing out. My chest clamps, breathing goes ragged, my hands shake, and I either snap at someone or shut down; "noticing" just feels like making it more urgent. I could try to sit with it, but I keep thinking that's how I'll miss something important, so being "with it" feels reckless. I'm jittery and distracted right now — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like making room for it feels like a threat to what matters. When you say you're worried about missing something important, what if the truth is that you're already showing up for it, even when the machine is loud?

Patient: Maybe I'm technically showing up, but it feels pointless—the machine screams that even if I grind through the work the doctors will miss something, my health will crash, I'll flunk and end up alone, so showing up just postpones the collapse. I'm jittery, my chest is tight, and I can't trust that "showing up" actually changes the inevitable; it just leaves me exhausted and snappy. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the feeling of pointlessness is really strong right now. When you say that showing up doesn't change the inevitable, what if *not* showing up—the way you're imagining it—actually makes the collapse more likely?

Patient: I can see that—logically, not showing up would probably make things worse, and part of me knows that. But my fortune-telling machine immediately screams that even if I show up the doctors will miss it, I'll crash, and I'm only postponing the inevitable, so I can't trust that showing up actually helps. I'm jittery and my hands are shaking; I'm stuck and don't know what to do—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the machine is really loud right now. When you notice the machine screaming, what would it be like to notice the *not*-screaming part—just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I try to look for a quiet spot, but there never is one—if I catch a tiny not-screaming moment it just feels like the calm before the storm and then the machine explodes with missed diagnosis, collapsing, flunking out. My hands are shaking, my chest tightens, and I can't trust a brief silence—it feels like a trap that proves the collapse is coming. I'm really overwhelmed right now—can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like the not-screaming moment feels like a setup for the machine to explode. When you say that feeling like a trap makes you even more anxious, what matters to you right now—what would it be like to *move* toward what matters, even if the machine is still loud?

Patient: What matters is keeping my grades, staying independent, and not being a burden. Moving toward that right now would be: press my feet into the floor, do three slow belly breaths, then set a two‑minute timer and force myself to read one paragraph — but I'm jittery, my hands are shaking, and the machine is already screaming that it's pointless, that the doctors will miss it, I'll collapse, and I'll still flunk out anyway. I'm overwhelmed and irritated — can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to move toward what matters, even though the machine is still really loud. When you say that the machine is screaming that it's pointless, what would it be like to notice that thought *without* trying to change it or prove it wrong?

Patient: I try that, but it still feels like I'm feeding it—labeling "it's pointless" just makes the machine blare louder, listing missed diagnosis, collapsing health, flunking out, ending up alone. My chest tightens, my hands tremble, and I either snap or shut down, and I don't know how to notice it without it winning. I'm jittery and distracted right now—can we slow down?
