Patient: I've been really on edge — furious over small stuff since my kid moved out, and my OCD just makes everything feel ten times worse. I'm used to solving problems at work as a software developer, but this anger blindsides me and wrecks my relationships. Honestly, I'm skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to help?

Therapist: When you say "talking about it," what's holding you back from actually doing that right now?

Patient: I guess I'm holding back because I'm embarrassed and scared — I don't want to sound dramatic or like I'm failing. My OCD makes me worry I'll say the wrong thing and spiral, and I've talked about this before and it didn't change anything. So how is talking about it supposed to help? I want practical steps, not just feelings.

Therapist: What matters most to you right now, when you're feeling overwhelmed by that anger and your OCD, isn't changing your thoughts or avoiding feelings—it's what you can do with your body while you're feeling like that.

Patient: Right now I just want something that stops me from blowing up — my chest tightens, my hands clench, and then I say things I can't take back. If we're talking body stuff, I want quick, practical moves: pacing, squeezing something, cold water on my face, or grounding steps. But how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing and "grounding" before and it just makes me more aware of the anger and my OCD starts spiraling.

Therapist: What would happen to that tightness in your chest if you weren't trying to "stop" it?

Patient: I don't know... when I don't try to stop it, sometimes it spikes and then slowly eases, but other times it builds and I end up snapping and saying stuff I regret. My OCD kicks in and I just replay the moment on loop, so not doing anything feels like letting it fester. How is that supposed to help with actually keeping me from blowing up?

Therapist: Not trying to stop it is one thing; what would it be like if, for just a moment, you could make room for that tightness while still moving towards what matters to you?

Patient: I guess it'd feel...odd — like holding that tight ball in my chest but not letting it run the show, so I could still pick up the dog, call my kid, or take a walk instead of snapping. In theory that means the feeling gets smaller while I do something that actually matters to me, but how is that supposed to help when 'just accept it' has never stopped me from losing it? I'm tired of vague stuff — if that's what you mean, give me one tiny, concrete thing I can do the moment my hands start clenching.

Therapist: When your hands start clenching, what's the first small action you could do without trying to stop the tightness—just notice what's happening in your hands and move toward that small action:

Patient: I could notice the clench, let my hands drop to my lap, and slowly open and close my fingers three times—just that one tiny motion. But I'm skeptical: I've done squeeze/release stuff before and my brain just starts counting or replaying it, so how is that actually supposed to stop me from snapping?

Therapist: If your mind starts counting or replaying while you're doing that small motion—just notice what happens when you say "that's what my mind is doing" while your hands drop to your lap and you open and close your fingers:

Patient: Okay — I say, "that's what my mind is doing," let my hands drop, and open/close my fingers three times. For a beat it actually feels like the volume turns down on the anger, my chest eases a little, and I can breathe slower. But then my brain starts counting the motions or rewinding the fight, and the loop kicks back in louder. How is that supposed to help long-term when the label only buys me a few seconds before the OCD hijacks it again?

Therapist: When the counting starts, what matters most to you isn't stopping the thoughts, but what you can do with your body while you're still noticing them:

Patient: Okay — I can try planting my feet, feel the floor, let my hands drop, open and close my fingers three times, exhale slowly, then stand up and walk to get a glass of water or step outside for 30 seconds. When the counting starts I’ll say out loud, “that’s the loop,” and keep doing the motion instead of fighting the thought. Sometimes that actually turns the heat down for a few breaths, but usually it only gives me a few seconds before the OCD rewinds everything—so how is that supposed to help when I’ve got like thirty seconds before I snap? Give me one concrete phrase or tiny action I can do right when I’m already halfway to losing it.

Therapist: When you're already halfway to snapping, what's the smallest thing you could do to make room for that feeling while still moving toward what matters to you, without trying to stop the thoughts:

Patient: Maybe the tiniest thing: drop my hands to my lap, press my feet into the floor, and exhale slowly for five counts while quietly saying, "This isn't running me." I don't know, sounds dumb and I'm worn out, but maybe that little shift could buy me a few breaths to step outside or get a glass of water before I actually snap.

Therapist: That's a tiny step toward making room for the feeling without trying to control it. What would it mean to you to do that small shift *while* you're getting that glass of water or stepping outside—the moment when you're already halfway to snapping:

Patient: It'd mean I can still do the normal stuff — get the water, step outside — without letting the tight ball in my chest run everything, like a tiny proof I can choose differently. But honestly it feels fragile, like a band-aid that might hold for a minute and then the OCD rewinds everything — how is that supposed to help long-term? I don't have much energy to keep trying stuff that mostly buys a few breaths.

Therapist: When the band-aid doesn't last, what matters most to you isn't the specific trick—it's that you're showing up to what matters to you *despite* the tightness:

Patient: Yeah, I get that showing up matters—calling my kid, walking the dog—but "show up" sounds vague when my chest's tight and my brain's looping. How is that supposed to help? I need one literal line to say and one tiny move I can do right when I'm halfway to snapping, because I'm drained and my head's already jumping around.

Therapist: What if, when you feel the tightness, you say "I'm here" to your kid while you're already halfway to snapping, and your tiny move is just noticing your hands in your lap for 3 seconds:

Patient: "Saying 'I'm here' feels... thin. When I'm halfway to snapping my voice tightens and I can barely get words out — noticing my hands for 3 seconds might be doable, maybe pressing my thumb to my forefinger, but my brain's already jumping and the loop starts. How is that supposed to help long-term? Give me one firmer, no-nonsense line I can say and one tiny action that's actually automatic when I'm this close.

Therapist: What if, when you feel the tightness, you say "I'll hold it" to your kid, and your tiny move is just *holding* your breath for 1 second:

Patient: Holding my breath? No — that just makes my chest worse. "I'll hold it" feels like I'm stuffing stuff, not actually doing anything.

Say something short and firm: "I'm stepping out." Tiny automatic move: plant my feet, push off the chair, take three deliberate steps away and exhale on the third step. It sounds dumb and I'm worn thin, but at least it's something I can do without having to talk through the loop — though honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: When you step out, what matters isn't the loop—it matters that you're taking action toward what matters to you, not away from it:

Patient: So you're saying stepping out should be toward something — like using those three steps to go call my kid or walk the dog — not just running away from the fight. I kinda get that, but I'm not sure I follow how that actually breaks the loop long-term instead of just delaying the replay. My hands are already clenching just thinking about it, and honestly, how is that supposed to help when the OCD craps back in after a few breaths?

Therapist: What if, when you step out, the loop doesn't have to end—it just needs to be *between* the steps?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you mean let the loop run during the steps instead of trying to kill it? That sounds possible in theory, but when I'm already halfway to snapping my brain doesn't politely sit between steps; it ratchets up and I end up blurting. How is that supposed to help me actually not say things I regret? Can you give one concrete, step-by-step example I can do right when it's happening?

Therapist: What if, when your hands are clenching and the loop is running, you say "I'll take the first step" *right now*, and your tiny move is just *planting your feet* without waiting for your brain to finish the story?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — plant my feet and say "I'll take the first step"? I could force my body to do that, but when I'm halfway there my throat tightens and my brain screams and I still end up blurting — how is that supposed to stop me from saying things I regret? I'm worn out from trying stuff that only buys a few breaths, so if you want me to try it, give me one exact sentence to say and one tiny, automatic move I can do right now.

Therapist: What if, when you feel the tightness and the loop starts, you say "I'm with my hands in my lap" *while* you press your thumb to your forefinger *just once*?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? But alright, I'll try: quietly say, "I'm with my hands in my lap," press my thumb to my forefinger once, and exhale. Feels dumb and I'm worn out, but maybe it buys a beat to step away.

Therapist: What matters most to you in those few seconds isn't stopping the loop—it's taking that step toward calling your kid.

Patient: It would mean I didn't let the loop win — that I can actually reach out to my kid instead of exploding, but it still feels fragile. I'm not sure I follow how that actually prevents the blowup long-term; my hands are clenching just thinking about it — give me one exact, no-nonsense line to say and one automatic move to do right before I hit call.

Therapist: What if, right before you call your kid, you say "I see the anger" *and* *push the chair away* with your feet?

Patient: I don't know — "I see the anger" sounds thin when my throat's already clamped; I need something blunt that will actually come out. "I'm stepping out" fits me better — push the chair with my feet, take three deliberate steps away, exhale on the third, then hit call. But how is that supposed to stop the OCD replay and keep me from blurting once I start the call? I'm worn out from trying tricks that only buy seconds.

Therapist: What if, after you step away, you just make the call *without* trying to stop the replay?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you mean call while the replay's running? I could try one exact thing: push the chair away with my feet, take three steps back, exhale on the third, say a flat line like "I want to talk" and then hit call and let the loop play without fighting it. But honestly that feels fragile — my chest's already tight and my brain will just rewind me into apologies and blurting. How is that supposed to stop me from saying things I regret on the call?

Therapist: What if, when you make the call, you don't try to stop the replay—it just matters that you're talking to your kid.

Patient: Maybe. I could try a flat, blunt opener like, "I want to talk — I love you." Hold the phone with both hands, press my thumbs together once, and exhale on that first line to steady my voice. It might buy me ten seconds to start without blurting, but honestly — how is that supposed to help when the replay drags me under five minutes in? I'm worn out from trying stuff that just delays the explosion.

Therapist: What if, when you say "I love you," you don't try to *use* that feeling to change the call—it just matters that you're saying it.

Patient: Maybe saying "I love you" flat — press my thumbs together, breathe, then just start the call without trying to make it mean anything — could be doable. But my throat tightens and the replay still drags me under after a few minutes, so how is that supposed to help long-term? I don't know, I'm worn out and it's hard to see how this actually stops the blowups.

Therapist: What if, after you say "I love you," you're not trying to make the call work *for* you—it's just what you're saying to your kid.

Patient: Maybe—saying "I love you" flat and not weaponizing it could work. I can press my thumbs, breathe, say it, start the call, and let the replay run. But honestly, I'm worn out and I don't see how that stops the spiral five minutes in when my throat clamps and I start apologizing or snapping. Give me one exact thing to do during the call when the replay spikes — something tiny and automatic I can actually pull off.

Therapist: What if, when your throat starts clamping and the replay spikes, you *say "I'm here"* exactly three words:

Patient: "Say 'I'm here' three words?" — fine. I can force it out flat: "I'm... here," press my thumbs together on the last word and breathe out slowly. Feels thin and fragile and my chest's already clamped — how is that supposed to stop the replay five minutes in?

Therapist: What if, when you say "I'm here," you don't try to stop the replay—it's already happening.

Patient: I'm trying to follow—so you want me to say "I'm here," press my thumbs, and not fight the replay while I'm talking? I can probably force that out, but I'm not sure I follow how letting it run doesn't just lead to me blurting or apologizing five minutes in. What's the one tiny, automatic thing I can do in the middle of the call when the replay spikes that actually keeps me from snapping? How is that supposed to help long-term?

Therapist: What if, when the replay spikes, you *move your feet* slightly *to the right*?

Patient: Move my feet slightly to the right? I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? I mean, I can try shifting my feet right while I press my thumbs and say "I'm here" flat, maybe it gives me a tiny break, but it feels kind of dumb and I'm worn out. I'm skeptical it'll stop the replay long-term, but okay—I'll try it.
