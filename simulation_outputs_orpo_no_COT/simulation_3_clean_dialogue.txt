Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism over every perceived failure, and it's getting worse with the instability in my business and the job losses. I think a lot of it comes from growing up with inconsistent parents — I never learned how to be gentle with myself. I'm skeptical this will actually help, but I'm here to see if talking through it does anything different.

Therapist: It sounds like being kind to yourself feels really far from what you know right now. When you notice that harsh self-criticism, what happens in your body – like tension or a knot – if you could just make room for that feeling for a moment?

Patient: I get this tightness in my chest and a knot in my stomach — my shoulders tense up, my jaw clenches, and my breathing gets shallow. I try to notice it, but honestly it just seems to make the critic louder instead of softer — how is that supposed to help? I've tried the "feel it" thing before and it doesn't seem to change the voice.

Therapist: It can feel like that criticism is getting louder, even when you're trying to notice it. What if, instead of trying to make the critic softer, you could just acknowledge it – like noticing the knot in your chest while you're still holding the thought – and then ask: what might be possible with the space to notice that knot, even if the critic is still there?

Patient: Maybe if I could actually make space for the knot, I might get a little pause between the thought "I'm worthless" and the reaction — that pause could stop me from spiraling into more self-crit. But honestly, that feels abstract; I've tried "noticing" before and it just makes the anxiety louder or turns into rumination. How is that supposed to help when I'm worried about rent and losing clients? I'm trying to see the connection, but I'm not convinced this will change anything in the moment.

Therapist: It sounds like making space for the knot feels like a luxury you can't afford right now. What would it be like to try making that space for just 30 seconds, not to change the thought or make it go away, but just to notice what's there while you're still worrying about rent and clients?

Patient: I can try it, but I'm skeptical — usually that kind of noticing just makes the knot louder and then my brain goes straight to worst-case scenarios about rent and losing clients. Maybe a 30-second pause could stop me from immediately attacking myself, but it feels like a fragile experiment when everything's urgent. How is 30 seconds supposed to help when the problems are real and immediate?

Therapist: Those problems are real and immediate. Can you notice what's making the 30 seconds feel fragile – is it the thought that it won't be enough, or the fear that you'll still make a mistake?

Patient: I think it's both — I don't trust that 30 seconds will be enough, and I'm also terrified I'll still mess up and lose clients. There's this real, practical panic that pausing feels like something I can't afford right now. I don't know, I'm skeptical this will stop the spiral — how is that supposed to help when the consequences are real?

Therapist: The panic about not having enough time or not being able to control what happens feels really connected to the value you care about – taking care of yourself and your business. What would it be like to pause for 30 seconds not because you think it will change everything, but because it feels like it might actually help you connect with what matters to you, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Maybe if I actually paused I’d remember why I’m doing this and not jump straight to punishing myself, but pausing also feels like giving the critic time to list every screw-up. How is that supposed to help when, growing up, pauses meant no one would show up and things fell apart — I learned to act fast or else. Still, I guess a tiny pause might stop me from making a panicked decision that costs a client, but I’m not convinced it’ll actually stick.

Therapist: Those feelings about pausing feeling like giving the critic time to list all the things that are going wrong – that sounds really painful. And the connection to your childhood is strong – it makes sense that you'd associate pauses with things falling apart. What if, instead of trying to make that connection work, you just noticed what happens when you notice it – what's there right now, just for a moment, before you try to do anything else?

Patient: Right now there's this heavy pressure in my chest and a loop in my head — "I'm failing, I'm going to lose everything" — my jaw's clenched and my breathing's shallow, and I get flashes of empty accounts and clients walking away. It drags up that old, awful childhood feeling of waiting and no one showing up, so pausing feels like a risk. I get that you're asking me to notice, but how is that supposed to help? Still, if I try for a moment I can see the knot and there's a tiny space between the thought and my reaction, but it feels fragile and I'm honestly pretty overwhelmed by it.

Therapist: The knot in your chest and the flashes of empty accounts – what happens when you're with that knot, not trying to change it, but just noticing it – is it like you're waiting for something to happen, even if it's not there?

Patient: Yeah — it's exactly like that: I find myself bracing, waiting for the next thing to fail even if nothing's happened yet. When I try to just notice it, my body's still ready to react — tight shoulders, shallow breath — and my mind starts rehearsing every worst-case, so the pause often becomes more rumination. I get why you'd ask me to stay with it, but how is that supposed to help when it feels like I'm just giving the critic more time? Still, that tiny gap I felt just now was...maybe something, but it's fragile and makes me uneasy.

Therapist: Noticing the wait in your body, not trying to change it, but just noticing it – what happens if that wait wasn't about fixing something, but just being with what's there?

Patient: If the wait wasn't about fixing anything, it just feels...exposed — like I'm leaving a door open for whatever's going to bite me. Sometimes that exposure eases the urge to grab at solutions and my breath loosens a bit, but more often the critic just starts listing everything that could go wrong. How is that supposed to help with the actual panic about clients and rent — and what would "being with it" actually look like for, say, 30 seconds without turning into rumination?

Therapist: The fear of exposure – that's a strong one. What if, for 30 seconds, you could be with that exposure not as something to be fixed, but as something that's already there – like the air you breathe – without trying to change it? Not to make it go away, but just to notice it. What would that look like for you, with the critic still there, but not as the main thing?

Patient: Okay — I think that would look like me letting the tightness sit in my chest and naming it out loud in my head — "tightness, shallow breath, jaw clench" — and just coming back to my breath when the critic pipes up instead of answering it. Maybe I'd count breaths or quietly hold attention on the sensations so the thought "I'm failing" isn't the first thing I act on, which could give me a second to choose a less panicked move. But honestly, it still feels fragile and like a luxury when rent and clients are real — how is that supposed to help right now? I'm willing to try it for 30 seconds if you want me to, though I'm not convinced it'll stick.

Therapist: Naming the sensations out loud – that's a brave move. And holding attention on your breath, even when the critic shows up – that's not about changing the thought, but about creating space. What if, instead of asking "how is this supposed to help," you just noticed what's already there – the tightness, the breath, the critic – and did that for 30 seconds, without trying to use it to fix anything?

Patient: Okay — I'll try it for 30 seconds. I notice the tightness in my chest, jaw clench, and my breath is shallow; the critic's already shouting "you're failing" but I can feel a tiny gap where I don't immediately reach for a fix. It felt fragile — my mind kept jumping to bills and losing clients — how is that supposed to help when the consequences are real? Can you stay with me while I try it again, maybe count the breaths or guide me through it?

Therapist: Let's try it again. Notice the tightness in your chest, the jaw clench, and the shallow breath. When the critic shows up with "you're failing," notice it like a thought – "I'm failing" – and say it out loud with me: "I'm failing." *pause* And then bring your attention back to the sensations: "My chest feels tight, my jaw is clenched, and my breath is shallow."

Patient: Okay — I said "I'm failing." My chest's tight, jaw clenched, breath shallow; naming it opened a tiny gap where I didn't immediately lunge for a fix, but the critic's still yelling about bills and clients. How is that supposed to help when the consequences are real? Can you stay with me and count the next few breaths so I don't spiral?

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* The critic's still there, but what's happening with your chest, jaw, and breath? They're still there, even if the thought "I'm failing" is.

Patient: My chest's still tight and my jaw's clenched, but my breath's a touch steadier — still shallow though. Naming the thought made a tiny gap, but it feels fragile and my head's already filling with bills and clients walking away. How is that supposed to help when the consequences are real? Can you keep counting with me for a few more breaths so I don't spiral?

Therapist: *I'll keep counting with you* Four... five... six... *pause* Notice how the tightness in your chest hasn't changed, but the breath is still a little steadier. What would it be like to hold that steadiness for just one more breath, without trying to fix the thought or the bills?

Patient: Okay — I'll try one more breath. My chest loosens a little and my jaw's not as tight, and my breath actually got a touch deeper, but the critic's still in the background listing bills and clients leaving. How is holding one more breath supposed to help when I still have to make calls and pay rent? Can you keep counting with me — I don't trust myself not to spiral if you stop.

Therapist: *I'll keep counting with you* Seven... eight... nine... *pause* Notice how the loosening in your chest isn't about making the critic go away, but about holding the space for just one more moment. What would it be like to let that moment be enough, not for fixing the bills or clients, but just for... being.

Patient: It feels both like a tiny relief and like a trap — my chest loosens a bit, but part of me thinks I'm just postponing the panic. How is that supposed to help when I actually have to call clients and cover rent? I'm willing to keep doing this if you stay with me — count with me for a bit longer — and then help me turn that pause into one or two concrete, realistic next steps so pausing doesn't feel like a luxury or avoidance.

Therapist: *I'll keep counting with you* Ten... eleven... twelve... *pause* That's a tough feeling – the relief and the worry mixing together. It sounds like you're trying to make sense of what's happening, and that's okay. Now, I want to ask: what's one small thing you could do right now, with the loosening in your chest, that wouldn't make the panic worse? Not to fix the bills or clients, but just to make room for one tiny step forward.

Patient: I could send one very short, factual message to my most reliable client — like, “Can we confirm our meeting Wednesday at 10am?” — it’d take two minutes and might stop me from spiraling into panic. But honestly, how is that supposed to help with the bigger bills and everything? Can you stay with me and count the breaths or just be here while I draft and send it so I don’t bail?

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* That message sounds like a tiny act of kindness to yourself – acknowledging the client's needs, even when the rest feels overwhelming. It might not fix everything, but it's a small step. What if, after sending that message, you took a minute to notice what's still pressing – the bills, the panic – but you didn't have to tackle it right then?

Patient: Okay — I'll send a quick message: "Can we confirm our meeting Wednesday at 10am?" — can you stay with me and count breaths while I draft and send it so I don't bail? I still don't see how that really helps with the bigger bills, but after I send it can you help me pick one or two concrete next steps I can actually do about money that won't make me spiral?

Therapist: *I'll stay with you* One... two... three... *pause* You sent the message. Now, take a deep breath with me... *pause* I'll count the breaths again when you're ready.

Patient: I sent it — tiny relief, but I'm still on edge. I need help picking one or two realistic money steps I can actually do now without spiraling — like call the bank about a payment plan or draft an invoice to a past-due client. How is calling the bank supposed to help with rent right this second? Can you stay with me and count breaths while I choose and start one of those so I don't bail? I don't trust myself to do it alone.

Therapist: *I'll stay with you* One... two... three... *pause* Those steps still feel important, but they're not going to make the rent appear. What if, instead of trying to fix everything at once, you just chose one small thing to do right now – like calling the bank about that payment plan. Not to pay the rent, but just to take care of that one tiny piece of it. *pause* What's the smallest part of that payment plan call that you can make right now, without having to fix everything else?

Patient: Okay — the smallest thing I can do right now is two tiny steps: pull up my bank app to check the balance/due date and find the customer service number, and write one short sentence of what I'll say (like, “I need information about a short payment plan or one-month deferral”). I get that it won't make the rent appear, so how is that supposed to help right now? Can you stay with me and count breaths while I do that and help me tighten the one-line script so I don't bail?

Therapist: *I'll stay with you* One... two... three... *pause* Those two tiny steps sound like a small victory. When you're ready, I'll count the breaths with you as you pull up the app, find the number, and write that sentence. *pause* What if, just for one moment, you let yourself do that small action – not to make the rent appear, but just to make room for the next tiny step?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. I'm opening the bank app now; can you count breaths while I find the number so I don't bail? I drafted: "Hi, I'm calling about my account — I need information on options to defer a payment or set up a one-month extension; can you tell me what’s available?" I don't know how that actually helps the rent, but it feels less impossible if you stay with me.

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* You did it! You found the number and wrote the sentence. Now, I'll stay with you as you make the call. *pause* What happens when you pick up the phone and say that sentence?

Patient: If I pick up the phone I can feel my throat tighten and my voice go thin — I'll start rushing through worst-case scripts and be terrified they'll say no or put me on hold forever. Part of me thinks I'll hang up before I even get the sentence out, but part of me imagines a tiny relief if they offer a short deferral or at least a clear answer. I'll do it if you stay with me and count breaths or keep me grounded while I call — but honestly, how is talking to them supposed to help with rent right this second?

Therapist: *I'll stay with you* One... two... three... *pause* You're already noticing the thoughts and feelings – the tightening throat, the rush to worst-case scripts. That's not about fixing the rent, but about what matters to you right now: taking care of that tiny step. What if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you just let the sentence be – "I need information on options to defer a payment or set up a one-month extension"? Not to fix the rent, but just to make room for the next tiny step.

Patient: I can try to let the sentence be, but my throat's already tight and I can feel myself racing — I'm terrified I'll hang up before I get it out. How is that supposed to help with rent right now? Can you stay with me and count breaths while I call so I actually say the line and don't bail?

Therapist: *I'll stay with you* One... two... three... *pause* You're right, the racing is already happening. What if, instead of trying to stop it, you just acknowledge it – "My throat is tight, my mind is racing" – and then take that small step forward? Not to fix the racing, but just to make room for the sentence. I'll count the breaths with you, but I want you to focus on making that one small call.

Patient: Okay — I'll try to make the call. My throat's so tight I can barely think straight and I'm already panicking I'll hang up, so can you count breaths with me while I dial? Honestly, how is this one sentence to a bank supposed to help with rent right this second, but... I'm doing it anyway.

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* You're dialing, and that's a huge step. I want you to notice what happens when you say "Hello" – not to fix anything, but just to make that tiny connection. And when you hear the person's voice, what if you just say the sentence without judgment – "I need information on options to defer a payment or set up a one-month extension"?

Patient: I said "hello" — my voice came out thin — and then I said the sentence. They asked for my account number, said they can review options and maybe offer a one-month deferral but it'll take up to 48 hours to confirm. There's a tiny relief in that possibility, but mostly I'm just back to waiting and panicking — it feels exactly like being a kid waiting for someone who never showed up. How is a possible callback in two days supposed to help me pay rent tonight? Can you stay with me, count breaths while I draft a short message to a past-due client and help me keep it simple so I don't bail?

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* You're still feeling that weight of waiting and panicking, and it's like being a kid again. But what if, instead of trying to control the outcome, you just focus on what you can do right now? You've already made that one small step – calling the bank. What if, just for one minute, you could do that same small step with the client? Drafting a message – that's a tiny act of kindness to yourself. I'll help you make it simple. What would you say to them if they needed a small step right now – "Hey, I'm working on getting your invoice out to you as soon as possible"?

Patient: Maybe something like: "Hi [Name], I'm finalizing your invoice and can send it by Friday. Is this email the best place to send it? Thanks." Short, factual, not begging.

But honestly — how is that supposed to help? I'm terrified they'll react badly or ghost me and then I'm back to panicking about money. Can you stay with me and count breaths while I send it, and help me tighten the wording if it feels too weak?

Therapist: *I'll count the breaths with you* One... two... three... *pause* Your message sounds clear and kind. What if, instead of worrying about the outcome, you just focus on what matters to you right now – getting that invoice out to the client? You've already taken that small step by drafting the message. Now, what if you just sent it and didn't wait for a response? Just a tiny step forward, without expecting anything back.

Patient: Okay — I sent it. There's a tiny relief, but I'm still on edge, like I'm waiting for someone who might not show up — how is that supposed to help with rent tonight? Can you stay with me and help pick one or two practical money moves I can actually start now (call my landlord about a short extension, or ask a past-due client for a partial payment), and count breaths while I do them so I don't bail?
