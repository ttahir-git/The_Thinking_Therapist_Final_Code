--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hey, uh—so lately it's been the new job that's been on my mind, and I keep defaulting to jokes and sarcasm so I don't have to feel how... overloaded I am. I guess I use the humor to shut down the uncomfortable stuff, and I don't know how to stop doing that.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When you notice that humor comes up in those moments, what would happen if you made room for that feeling of overwhelm for just one breath? Not to change it, but to see what might show up if you let it be there – like what matters most to you about this new job, or what matters most about feeling that way.

Patient: One breath? I don't know — I'd probably crack a dumb joke or shrug it off. I guess if I actually sat with it for even a breath I'd notice I'm scared of messing up and looking weak, and that I care about being able to provide and do the job right. Uh, but can we talk about the coffee on site instead?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like there's a lot of value in showing up for that care about providing – what matters most about doing the job right for you.

Patient: I don't know — I guess it's mostly about not letting my partner and kids down, keeping the bills paid, and still feeling like I'm useful, not some old guy who can't handle the job. And yeah, I don't like feeling like a kid who can't fix stuff. Uh... also, the coffee on site tastes terrible — you ever deal with bad coffee?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The taste of the coffee seems like a small thing that can show up when you're feeling anxious about the bigger stuff. When you notice the coffee, what happens if you let that "bad coffee" be there – just as it is – without trying to fix it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know — if I let the coffee be there I'd notice it's bitter and kind of like everything else right now, small junk stacking up until I feel overloaded. I guess admitting that makes me feel exposed, so my first instinct is to crack a joke about it (this stuff could strip paint). Honestly, I'm trying to sit with it and it's awkward — can we talk about how the crew keeps blowing off the new schedule?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: The joke seems like a way to protect yourself from feeling exposed – and it's also connected to the feeling of being overwhelmed by all those small things. When you notice that urge to make a joke, what would happen if you made room for that feeling of being stuck – not to change it, but to notice what matters most to you about being able to handle the job and show up for your family?

Patient: I don't know — I'd probably make a dumb joke and change the subject. If I actually let that stuck feeling be there, I guess I'd notice it's mostly fear of letting my family down, of not being dependable, and of feeling useless or like I'm past my prime. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed saying that out loud — can we slow down?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It's like there's a part of you that's getting pushed away when you notice those feelings – what if you could just notice that feeling of overwhelm, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: I don't know — I'd probably try to make a joke and sweep it under the rug. If I actually let the overwhelm be there, my chest gets tight and I feel like I'm shrinking, like I'm gonna let the family down, and that feels... awful to say out loud. Okay, I'm getting kind of uncomfortable — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: When you notice your chest getting tight and you feel like shrinking, what's the smallest thing you could do with that feeling – not to change it, but just to notice it – while still speaking?

Patient: I don't know — maybe the smallest thing is just saying it out loud, like "my chest is tight," and taking one slow breath while I say it. I guess saying it makes it feel less huge... uh, also, the crew keeps blowing off the new schedule — can we talk about that for a minute?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Just noticing your chest feeling tight, with that one slow breath... what happens when you say it out loud – does it feel like you're still shrinking, or is there a tiny bit of space there?

Patient: I don't know — I guess there's a tiny bit of space when I say it out loud, like I can breathe a hair more instead of just folding in. But it still feels clamped and exposed, so my kneejerk is to crack a joke and steer away. Uh, speaking of steering away, the foreman's been flip‑flopping on the plan all week — can we talk about that for a sec?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: The flip-flopping sounds really tough to deal with – what matters most to you about the plan, and what would it take to feel like you're moving forward even when that's hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what matters most is reliability: that the plan keeps everyone safe, the job moving, and me proving I can still do this for my family. To feel like I'm moving forward I'd need clearer direction from the foreman, some small wins I can point to, and people sticking to the schedule instead of flip‑flopping. Uh, I'm getting a bit twitchy talking about it — can we go back to how the crew keeps blowing off the new schedule for a minute?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: You're noticing that talking about the plan is making you twitchy – what if you made room for that tension while still wanting to talk about the schedule?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I'd just say out loud, "my shoulders are tight," take a slow breath, and keep talking about the schedule. It'd still feel awkward and I'd probably crack a joke, but I could at least call out when the crew's not showing up on time. Like this morning three guys rolled in ten minutes late and then blamed traffic — that kind of stuff wrecks the whole day.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Noticing your shoulders feeling tight – and making room for that feeling while talking about the schedule – what happens if you say "that sounds really frustrating" about the crew showing up late, instead of just letting the joke happen?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I actually said "that sounds really frustrating" out loud it'd feel weird, like I'm admitting I'm more than just joshing. Maybe it'd make the crew take it a bit more seriously instead of laughing it off. Okay, I'm getting kinda exposed saying that — can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: Noticing how saying that might feel – and wanting to slow down – what's one tiny step you could take with that feeling, without having to change it or make a joke?

Patient: I don't know — maybe the tiniest step is just saying, out loud, "that’s frustrating," then taking one slow breath and not jumping to a joke. I guess saying it once might make it feel a bit smaller instead of me folding up. Uh, also—can we go back to the crew blowing off the schedule? That still bugs me.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Just noticing how saying "that’s frustrating" feels, with that one slow breath – what if you made room for that feeling while talking about the schedule, not to fix it, but just to notice what matters to you about it?

Patient: I don't know — if I actually made room for the feeling while talking about the schedule, I guess I'd notice that what matters most is keeping everyone safe and not having to be the one scrambling to fix other people's messes. Saying that out loud feels weird and exposed, but maybe it'd make it easier to call people out when they slack. Uh, can we go back to the foreman flip‑flopping? That still bugs me.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Just noticing what matters to you about keeping everyone safe – and wanting to make that matter while dealing with the foreman's flip-flopping – what if you made room for that feeling while you're talking to him about it, not to fix him, but just to notice what matters to you about the situation?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I sat with that feeling while talking to him I might actually say something like, "this flip‑flopping puts people at risk," instead of laughing it off. It feels weird and exposed to say it straight, though, so I'd probably crack a joke and then... uh, can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: Noticing that saying it straight still feels tricky – and wanting to crack a joke to ease it – what if you made room for the feeling of being exposed while talking to the foreman, and instead of laughing it off, you used that feeling to connect with what matters about keeping people safe?

Patient: I don't know — I'd probably try to say, "this flip‑flopping puts people at risk," but I'd feel exposed and end up making a joke to cover it. Maybe if I took a breath and started with, "I'm worried about safety," it might land different, but I guess I'm not sure I can actually do that without feeling weak. Uh, can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Just noticing how worried you are about safety – and wanting to connect with that feeling while talking to the foreman – what if, instead of trying to say it in a certain way, you started with that feeling: "I'm worried about safety" – and then saw what happens when you say it, without trying to fix it or make a joke?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how's saying "I'm worried about safety" supposed to help? I don't know, it just feels like admitting I'm weak; maybe if I said it straight the foreman would listen, but I'd probably crack a joke instead. Uh, can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm worried about safety" feels like a way to admit vulnerability – and that's not what's driving you to say it in the first place. What matters to you about stopping the flip-flopping, and what would matter more if you could talk about it in a way that feels true to you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it matters because it keeps folks safe and means I'm not always left cleaning up someone else's mess. If I could talk true to myself I'd just say, "this is dangerous, we need to stick to a plan," and hope they listen, but saying that makes me feel exposed. Uh, can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: You're noticing that saying "this is dangerous" feels like a way to connect with what matters about keeping people safe – and that it makes you feel exposed because it feels like admitting weakness. What would happen if, instead of trying to say it in a way that feels exposed, you just noticed that feeling and kept going with "this is dangerous, we need to stick to a plan"?

Patient: I don't know — if I actually said, "this is dangerous, we need to stick to a plan," maybe they'd shut up and listen, or maybe they'd laugh and I'd look soft. Saying it feels like a big lift right now; I don't have the fight in me to push it. Can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the feeling of saying it is really big right now – like you're not feeling the fight in you to push through it. When you notice that feeling, what matters most to you about stopping the flip-flopping, even if it feels like saying it is too hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what matters most is keeping people from getting hurt and making sure I don't end up fixing everyone else's mess so my family doesn't pay for it. Saying that out loud feels like a big lift and I kind of shrink at the thought, so I'm worn out just thinking about it. Can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: Noticing that saying it out loud feels like a big lift – and that the thought of it makes you shrink – what would it be like to make room for that feeling while you're still thinking about what matters to you about keeping people safe?

Patient: I don't know — maybe if I let that tight, exposed feeling sit for a second I could say "this is dangerous" without the joke, like a tiny crack instead of folding up. But I'm worn out thinking about it and it still feels like admitting weakness. Can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Just noticing that tiny crack – saying "this is dangerous" without the joke – what if, instead of trying to make it bigger or fix it, you just let that tiny crack be there for a second, and then see what happens when you say it while you're still feeling worn out?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I could let that tiny crack be there and whisper, "this is dangerous," but it still feels like too big a lift right now. Can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Whispering it might be smaller, but what if you didn't have to whisper it at all – what if you could say it out loud, even if it feels like too big a lift, and still take a tiny step towards saying what matters to you about keeping people safe?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I could say it once, plain: "This is dangerous, we need to stick to the plan," and then shut up and see what happens. I guess it still feels like a big lift and I don't have much left in me to push that right now. Can we go over what he changed last night again?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: Saying it once, plain, and then shutting up to see what happens – that feels like a small, manageable step. What would it take for you to make room for that one small step, even if it still feels like a big lift?

Patient: I don't know—maybe if I knew the foreman would back me up or one of the guys would have my back, I could say it once without feeling like I'm on my own. Maybe if I rehearsed a line a couple times and took a slow breath before I said it, it wouldn't feel like such a huge lift. Uh, also—can we go over again what he changed last night with the scaffolding?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: Noticing that you're still holding onto needing the foreman to back you up – and that rehearsing a line might help make it feel smaller – what if, instead of needing someone else's support, you made room for the possibility that you could do it on your own, even if it still feels hard?

Patient: I don't know — the idea of doing it on my own kind of terrifies me. I guess maybe I could rehearse the line in the truck a couple times, take a slow breath, say it once, and then shut up to see what happens. But honestly, it still feels like a big lift and I'm pretty worn out just thinking about it. Can we go over exactly what he changed with the scaffolding last night again?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: Rehearsing the line in the truck might help make it feel smaller – taking a slow breath, saying it once, and then shutting up to see what happens. Noticing that you're still feeling worn out just thinking about it – what would it take for you to make room for that small action, even if it still feels hard?

Patient: I don't know — maybe if I had a quick script, a minute in the truck to rehearse it, and one guy who'd back me up, I could manage that one line. But I'm kinda wiped just thinking about it and it feels like too much right now. Can we go over exactly what he changed with the scaffolding last night again?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: A quick script, a minute in the truck to rehearse it, and one guy who'd back you up – that's a specific way to make the task feel smaller. Noticing that you're still feeling wiped just thinking about it – what if you made room for the fact that you're tired right now, and still wanted to try to make that small action happen?

Patient: I don't know — maybe if I give myself permission to be wiped and only do the tiniest thing, like rehearse the line once in the truck and take a slow breath before I say it, that could work. I guess I'll try that: one quiet run‑through, say it once, then shut up. Uh... can we go over again exactly what he changed with the scaffolding last night?
