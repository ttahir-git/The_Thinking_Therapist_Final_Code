Patient: I'm a data scientist in my mid-fifties and lately I can't stop worrying about my performance at work. If I miss a deadline, it won't just be a reprimand — it'll lead to mistakes in the model, clients pulling out, me getting blamed, then demoted and eventually out of a job and unable to find anything comparable. Because I keep seeing that whole disaster play out, I freeze and procrastinate instead of getting started.

Therapist: That sounds like a really painful and all-consuming worry. It feels like you're not just worried about missing a deadline, but about the whole story that unfolds from it – the blame, the loss of clients, the impact on your career. What happens when you imagine that whole disaster playing out in your mind – what does it feel like to be in that space, frozen and paralyzed by it?

Patient: My chest tightens and my stomach drops — I get lightheaded and my hands feel useless, like I can't even type. My mind immediately runs the whole movie: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR gets involved, and I'm out of a job — I replay it over and over until I'm frozen and can't start. People say other outcomes are possible, but honestly that feels unrealistic; I just know that's how it ends.

Therapist: It sounds like when that worry shows up, your whole body feels like it's shutting down – tightness in your chest, your stomach drops, lightheadedness... it's like your mind and body are trying to protect you from that story. And even when others say "other outcomes are possible," it feels like that doesn't matter when you're in the grip of that fear. What would it be like to notice that story showing up, not as the only possible truth, but just as a thought – like a cloud passing over your mind?

Patient: I try to tell myself that, but when it starts it's not a thought — it's a full movie I can't turn off: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR gets involved, and I'm out on the street with no comparable job. My chest tightens and my hands go useless, and instead of doing the work I just sit there frozen. Saying it's "just a cloud" feels unrealistic — I can't help hearing the whole disaster replay like it's already happened.

Therapist: It feels like the worry is so deeply tied to your body that even when you try to label it as "just a cloud," it's still there, loud and clear – the chest tightness, the uselessness, the replaying of the whole disaster... It's like your body is trying to tell you something: that this story matters deeply, and that it feels like it's connected to your worth. What if, instead of trying to turn off the worry, you could make room for it – just for a moment – while still doing the work?

Patient: I can't just "make room" — the moment I notice it, the movie starts and it swallows me. I tried once, literally naming the worry, and within minutes I'm picturing clients leaving, my manager calling me incompetent, HR, and I'm frozen with my hands over the keyboard. It feels unrealistic that I could keep working while that whole disaster is playing; how would I actually do that without it taking over?

Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the worry, it's like a door closes, and the whole story comes flooding in – and you're right, it feels impossible to keep working in that space. What if, instead of trying to "make room" or turn it off, you looked at it like a signal – a signal that your body is telling you something important? Not about the story itself, but about what matters to you in that moment – like getting that work done, or showing up for your clients.

Patient: I hear you, but that "signal" isn't gentle for me — it's a blaring alarm that the whole thing is going to collapse. When it goes off my chest tightens, my hands go useless, and I can't type; imagining it as just a nudge feels impossible. I want it to push me to work, but right now it only freezes me and makes me panic that I'm already ruined.

Therapist: That alarm is really loud for you, and it feels like it's coming from a place of deep pain – the fear that you're not enough, that you'll fail, that you'll lose everything. It's not surprising that it's hard to imagine it as just a nudge when it feels like it's trying to rip you apart. What if, instead of trying to fight that alarm, you could lean into the pain – just for a moment – and see what happens if you let it be there, while still trying to do the work?

Patient: I get the idea, but when I try to "lean in" the movie just gets louder — I picture missing the deadline, the model failing, clients pulling out, my manager calling me incompetent, HR stepping in, and me scrambling for anything else and failing, ending up with nothing. My chest tightens, my hands go useless, and there's no way I can keep typing through that; the worry doesn't sit quietly, it takes over. Maybe I could try something tiny, like one minute of typing, but honestly I don't believe that would stop the spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to lean in, the worry gets even louder, and it feels like it's not just about the work – it's about your whole identity. And when you think about trying just one minute of typing, you wonder if that would even be enough to stop the spiral. What if, instead of trying to make the worry go away, you could make a tiny commitment to yourself – not to stop the worry, but to keep showing up to the work, even when it feels like the worry is trying to take over?

Patient: I want to, I really do, but committing to “just show up” feels like pretending the whole crash isn't already happening. The minute I try, the movie starts — I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in — and my chest tightens so my hands go useless. Maybe I could force myself to type for one minute, but honestly that feels like rearranging deck chairs on a sinking ship; I don't see how that would stop the spiral.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to commit to "just showing up" feels like it would require you to ignore the whole crash, and that feels impossible. And when you think about forcing yourself to type for one minute, you wonder if that would even matter in the long run. You're not trying to make the worry go away, but you are trying to find a way to keep doing the work, even when it feels like everything is falling apart. Can you imagine what would happen if, instead of trying to control the crash, you just noticed it happening – the chest tightens, the hands go useless, the movie starts playing – and you kept typing anyway, just for that one minute?

Patient: I tried that one-minute thing once — I forced myself to type for a minute and the movie just sped up: one minute turned into imagining the deadline slipping, the model failing, clients pulling out, my manager calling me incompetent, HR stepping in, and me out on the street. My chest clamps down, my hands go useless, and by the end of that minute I'm convinced I've already ruined everything so I stop. Honestly, it feels like a band‑aid on a sinking ship — I don't see how that would change the outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like forcing yourself to type for that one minute didn't actually stop the worry from getting worse – it just made it worse. And when you say it feels like a band-aid on a sinking ship, that makes sense – it's not addressing the underlying problem at all. What if, instead of trying to make the worry go away or control the outcome, you were just curious about what would happen if you kept typing – not because you wanted to avoid the worry, but because you wanted to see what would happen when you didn't stop it?

Patient: I tried being "curious" about it once, and the moment I kept typing the movie just inflates — I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. My chest tightens and my hands go useless so I end up stopping; being curious felt like watching the disaster in slow motion. I don't see how staying curious wouldn't just make the panic louder — can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like when you tried being curious about what would happen if you kept typing, the worry actually got bigger – it felt like watching the disaster in slow motion. And you're right, that doesn't sound like curiosity to me – it sounds more like feeling trapped in the worry. 

Can we try something small? What if, instead of trying to be curious about the worry, you just noticed what happens when you notice it – the chest tightens, the hands go useless, the movie starts playing – right now, while we're sitting here talking?

Patient: Okay, I can try — right now my chest clamps, my stomach drops, my breath gets shallow and my hands feel like they're glued to the keyboard. The movie kicks in immediately: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR gets involved, and I'm out on the street — it feels like it's already happened. Other outcomes don't feel realistic to me, and honestly it's getting louder — can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like even noticing what's happening right now – the chest clamping, the stomach dropping, the shallow breath – feels like it's going to get swept away by the worry. And when you say it feels like other outcomes don't feel realistic, that just makes it harder to imagine doing anything differently. 

What if, instead of trying to change what's happening in your body or in your mind, you could just acknowledge it – "This is what's showing up right now" – and then *stop* noticing it for just one moment?

Patient: I've tried that too — the second I name it, the movie cranks up: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients bail, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. My chest clamps, my hands go useless, and "noticing for a moment" never stays a moment — it just becomes another loop. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm really struggling to believe stopping noticing even for a beat would change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like naming what's happening is actually making it worse – the worry just gets louder. And when you say it feels like "noticing for a moment" never stays a moment, that makes sense. 

What if, instead of trying to stop noticing, you could just ask yourself: "What would it be like to do the work *right now*, even if it feels like the worry is going to win?"

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? The moment I even think about starting, the movie kicks in: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR gets involved, and I'm out on the street. My chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my hands go useless, and I can't see how doing the work now wouldn't just speed the whole thing up. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like even thinking about doing the work is getting caught up in the same worry – the movie plays, the chest tightens, the breath gets shallow... And you're right, that doesn't make sense if you're trying to do something different.

Let's try to break it down even smaller. What happens when you're sitting here, talking to me, *before* the worry kicks in?

Patient: Before the worry kicks in there's this tiny window — my chest is a bit looser, my breath steadier, and I can actually think about the data and type without my hands freezing up. But even in that quiet I get this flash of the whole disaster — a missed deadline, the model collapsing, clients leaving — and it drags me right back into the movie. I'm not sure I follow how focusing on that moment helps though; how is noticing that little calm supposed to stop the spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like even that tiny window of calm gets pulled back into the worry – the flash of the disaster shows up and you're right back in the movie. 

That's not about trying to "stop" the spiral or make the worry go away. It's about noticing what's already happening when you're sitting here – the calmness, the thoughts about the data, the hands not freezing up. What if you could just notice that calmness, without trying to change it or fix it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice the calm it doesn't stay calm: my chest loosens for a second, then the movie starts and I see the deadline slipping, the model failing, clients pulling out, my manager calling me incompetent, HR getting involved. My hands go useless and I can't type; I can try to "notice" for a beat, but I don't see how that would stop the spiral. Can we slow down? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm really struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the calm *while* the movie is playing just makes it harder to notice – your chest loosens for a second, then the worry comes back. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the calm *while* the movie is playing, you could just notice what's happening *before* the movie starts?

Patient: Before it starts there's this tiny window — my breath steadies, my chest loosens a notch, and my hands feel like they could actually type for a few seconds. But even if I notice that, I just know the movie is right behind it: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street — so noticing that calm feels useless. I'm not sure how noticing "before" would stop anything; can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that tiny window of calm before the movie starts is like holding onto a thought bubble – it's there, but it doesn't seem to make a difference in what happens when the movie plays. 

What if, instead of trying to notice that calm, you could just ask yourself: "What matters most to me right now, even if the movie shows up?"

Patient: What matters most is not screwing up this project — if I do, the whole chain follows: the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR gets involved, and I'm out on the street. I know that sounds bleak, but I can't shake it and I don't see other outcomes as realistic — can we slow down? I'm finding it really hard to see how any other answer actually helps.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of not screwing up the project is what matters most to you, and that's connected to the whole chain of things that matters to you – your job, your clients, your sense of self-worth. 

What if, instead of trying to change the whole chain, you could just focus on what matters most to you right now – not screwing up the project.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the second I try to focus on "don't screw up," the movie starts: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. My chest tightens, my hands go useless, and I can't get anything done. I don't see how narrowing the focus would stop that — can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like focusing on "don't screw up" is like trying to hold onto a thought that's already causing you distress – the movie shows up, and you're right back in the same place. 

Let's try to make a small space between noticing that thought and what you want to do. When you notice your chest tightening, your hands going useless, and the movie showing up, what happens *before* you try to stop it?

Patient: There's this split-second pause — like a tiny click — and my brain already declares, "it's ruined," and the movie starts before I can do anything. In that moment I just feel absolute certainty, my chest clamps, my hands go heavy, and I'm already reacting as if it's happened. I don't get a chance to decide anything — it feels automatic and any attempt to step in just feels pointless. Can we slow down? I'm not sure how noticing that helps.

Therapist: It sounds like that split-second pause is actually the moment where the "it's ruined" story shows up, and you're not even in a position to decide what to do with it. That's really hard to notice, because it feels like you're already reacting to it. 

What if, in that moment, you could just *be* with that feeling of certainty, without trying to change it or stop it?

Patient: I can try, but when I try to "be" with that certainty it doesn't calm anything — it opens the floodgate: I see myself missing the deadline, the model failing, clients pulling out, my manager calling me incompetent, HR stepping in, and I'm out on the street. It feels like by sitting with it I'm admitting it's already happened, and my chest tightens, my breath gets shallow, my hands go useless and I just freeze so I can't do any work. I'm not sure how that helps — can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to "be" with the certainty is like trying to hold onto a thought that's already causing you distress – the floodgate opens, and you're right back in the same place. 

What if, instead of trying to sit with the certainty, you could just notice what's happening *while* you're noticing it?

Patient: I don't really get how that's different — the second I try to notice *noticing*, the movie doubles down: deadline slips, model fails, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. My chest tightens and my hands go useless, so trying to track it just becomes another part of the loop — can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this would actually help.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice noticing itself just gets caught up in the same cycle. 

Let's take a step back. What matters to you most right now, not because of the outcome, but because of the feeling that matters to you?

Patient: Mostly I want to feel competent and safe — just enough calm to actually do the work without my chest tightening. But the instant I let that feeling matter, the movie kicks in and I know it's a lie: feeling competent now just means the rug will be pulled out, the deadline missed, the model failing, clients gone, and I'm ruined. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to hold onto feeling competent and safe, it feels like it's already slipping away – the movie shows up, and you're right back in the same place. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto that feeling, you could ask yourself: "What would it be like to make room for it, even for just one moment, while the movie is still playing?"

Patient: I don't see how "making room" would help — the moment I try, the movie floods in: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. My chest tightens, my hands go useless, and maybe I could attempt a tiny test for thirty seconds, but honestly I don't believe that'll stop the spiral. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling to see how this connects to my problem.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to "make room" for that feeling, it feels like it's already being overwhelmed by the movie. 

Let's try something different. What would happen if, instead of trying to change the movie, you just noticed what's happening in your body right now – the chest tightening, the hands going useless – while you're still sitting here talking to me?

Patient: Okay... right now my chest's clamping, my breath's shallow, and my hands feel stuck on the keyboard. The second I look at that I get the whole movie — miss the deadline, model fails, clients bail, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street — it already feels like it's happened. I don't see how noticing this wouldn't just crank it up — can we slow down? I'm not sure I follow how this helps.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is actually making it feel like the movie is already happening. 

Can you try to notice the physical sensations *before* the movie shows up? When you look at your chest clamping, your breath getting shallow, and your hands feeling stuck – what happens right before the movie kicks in?

Patient: There's this tiny, almost automatic click — a voice that declares "it's ruined" — and in that split second my chest clamps, my breath shortens, my hands go heavy, and the whole movie is already rolling before I can do anything. It feels hopelessly automatic; I don't see how noticing that beat would change the outcome. Can we slow down?

Therapist: It sounds like that automatic click is happening so quickly that you're not even in a position to notice it before the movie starts. 

Let's try to make room for that tiny click, not to change it, but just to see it happen – not because you want to stop the movie, but because you want to know what's happening when it happens.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to watch that click. There's this tiny automatic voice that goes "it's ruined" and then my chest clamps, my breath shortens, my hands go heavy, and the whole movie starts: I miss the deadline, the model tanks, clients pull out, my manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street. I can see that split-second happen, but I don't see how noticing it would change the outcome—can we slow down? This is wearing me out.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that click isn't changing the outcome for you, and that's okay. 

Let's take a deep breath together. When you're ready, I'd like you to notice what's happening in your body right now – not the click, not the movie, just what's happening in your body.

Patient: Okay — I breathe in once, and for a beat my chest loosens and I can feel air, but then it clamps down again; my breath gets shallow and my hands feel glued to the keys. The movie's already playing — deadline missed, model fails, clients leave, manager calls me incompetent, HR steps in, and I'm out on the street — I don't see how noticing this helps. Can we slow down? I'm really struggling.
