--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really down and kind of stuck since the move — I can't find the motivation to do much, even at the restaurant, and it's starting to screw up my relationship. My OCD makes the new place feel chaotic, little things spiral and I get worn out fast. I don't get how talking about it here is supposed to help — I've tried stuff before and it didn't work.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the overwhelm from the move is really suffocating you right now. Can you tell me what happens when you notice that feeling of "stuck" – like when you're sitting at the restaurant, and your mind starts racing with thoughts about what's not working, what's not up to your standards... what would that "stuck" feeling look like if it just showed up, without needing to be "fixed" or "done" first?

Patient: When it shows up it’s like a weight in my chest and my hands go tense — everything slows down and I get stuck watching the line like I can’t move. My head fills with the same loop: “it’s wrong, you missed something, you’re a screw-up,” and then I just stop doing anything useful. Okay, but how is saying that out loud supposed to help? I’ve told people this before and it didn’t change a damn thing.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That weight in your chest feels really heavy. It's like your whole body is trying to protect you from feeling like you're not doing enough. And when you notice that loop of self-criticism, it's like your mind is trying to make sense of it all, but it's not working. 

You're right, talking about it before hasn't made a difference. But what if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or the feelings, you just noticed them – even when they're really hard to be with? Like, what if you could see the weight in your chest, and the loop in your head, without needing to try to make it go away?

Patient: I've tried "just noticing" — did the apps, talked to someone before — and it just becomes another thing I feel like I should be doing, and then the loop gets louder. How is that supposed to help when I've got a full service and the line's collapsing and my head won't shut up? Alright, I can try right now to notice the weight in my chest and the loop, but I'm telling you, I'm skeptical it’ll actually change anything.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to "just notice" feels like another task you need to tackle, and that makes the loop even louder. That makes sense. 

What if, instead of trying to notice it or change it, you just tried it as an experiment – not to make the weight or the loop go away, but just to see what happens if you did notice it, while you're still sitting there at the restaurant, trying to do your job?

Patient: Alright, I'll try the experiment, but I'm telling you now — during a dinner rush this feels impossible. When I notice it, my chest tightens, my hands grip the counter, and the loop starts screaming I'm messing everything up, so I freeze. How is noticing that supposed to help me keep the line moving when I can't even breathe?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It feels like the loop is just getting louder, and the physical sensations are really overwhelming. 

What if, right now, while the loop is screaming "you're messing everything up", you just made room for the feeling of your chest tightening – without trying to stop it, or change it, or even notice what's making it happen – just noticed it as it was, like a physical sensation in your body?

Patient: Okay… I can kind of feel it — like a tight knot under my ribs and my shoulders clamping up. But every time I try to sit with it, it just becomes another thing on my plate and the line falls apart — how is noticing that supposed to help when I've got orders piling up?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot and the clamping feels like it's still trying to control what's happening in the moment – and that's making it hard to focus on the line. 

What if, instead of trying to control the knot, you just took one tiny step towards serving that next order – even if it feels like your whole body is resisting it?

Patient: Okay, I can picture doing that — the tiniest move would be just grabbing the next ticket and starting one plate, even if my hands are shaking. But how is that supposed to help when my head's already convinced I'll screw it up and then I freeze? I'll try it, but I'm telling you, I don't expect it to magically fix the loop.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're still worried that the loop will show up, even if you just focus on moving one tiny step forward. 

What if, instead of trying to fix the loop, you just made room for it to be there – as you're moving forward with that next order? Not to change it, or stop it, but just to notice that it's there, like a tiny thread in the fabric of your experience.

Patient: Alright… I tried making room for it and I can feel the loop right there while I reach for the ticket — my hands are shaking, chest still tight, but I can move a plate forward. It feels like doing it through molasses though, like I'm tolerating the chaos instead of being on top of it. How is that supposed to help when the orders keep piling and my brain's yelling I'm already screwed? I'm trying it, but I'm not convinced this is gonna fix the motivation or the way this is wrecking my relationship.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're still trying to push through the loop, even as you're making tiny steps forward – and that's exhausting. 

What if, instead of trying to "fix" the motivation or the relationship, you just noticed what's possible when you're moving forward, even with the loop present? Not to change it, but just to see what happens when you're doing the work, even if it feels like "tolerating" the chaos.

Patient: When I actually notice what's possible, yeah — I do catch small wins: a plate goes out on time, someone on the line gives me a quick nod, and for a second it feels like I didn't completely implode. But that doesn't fix the big stuff — I still go home drained and snap at my partner, and it all just piles up the next day like nothing changed. Okay, so how is noticing those tiny things supposed to get me motivated again or stop this from wrecking my relationship? I'm willing to try, but I'm not convinced and I don't know what the next step even looks like.

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 8]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like noticing those tiny wins feels like a tiny spark, but it's not enough to change the bigger picture – and that's what matters most to you. 

What if, instead of trying to "fix" the motivation or the relationship, you just noticed what matters most to you about those small wins – not what they're supposed to do for you, but just what they matter to you right now? For example, what does it mean to you that a plate goes out on time, that someone nods at you, or that you don't completely implode for a second?

Patient: They feel like proof I can still do the job — like one small, honest moment where I didn't totally fall apart. But it's so fleeting: I go home wiped and snap at my partner, then feel guilty and worthless the next day and it all piles back up. How is noticing that supposed to help me actually keep going or fix the relationship — how do I make that tiny spark mean something more than just a blip? My brain's racing now, sorry — I'm getting stuck on the worst-case stuff.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting caught up in the story of what's not working, and that's making it hard to notice what's actually happening. 

When you say "one small, honest moment where I didn't totally fall apart", what would it be like to notice that moment *even if* the next day felt awful? Not to try to make the guilt or worthlessness go away, but just to see what would happen if you noticed that tiny spark of doing the job *right there*, even when the rest of it felt so hard?

Patient: I guess it'd feel fragile — like a little proof I can still do the job, but I'm always bracing for it to disappear the second I walk out of the kitchen. Noticing that moment might give me a tiny break, but then the guilt and the spiral come back — how is that supposed to help with me going home and snapping at my partner? My chest's tightening just thinking about it and my brain's already jumping to worst-case, so I'm kind of distracted and not sure I can even hold onto that spark long enough to see if it does anything.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that moment would feel like a tiny lifeline, but it's hard to hold onto it when the worst-case stories are already swirling in. 

What if, instead of trying to hold onto that spark *while* the guilt and worst-case thoughts are still racing, you just noticed what would happen *when* those thoughts came up – not to try to make them go away, but just to see what would happen if you were already holding onto that tiny proof of doing the job, even when it felt like it was slipping away?

Patient: If those worst-case thoughts show up while I'm holding that tiny spark, I usually just watch it slip away — I feel like a fraud, then the guilt hits and I snap at my partner once I'm home. I guess I can try to notice both at the same time, but how is that supposed to stop me from blowing up later? My chest's tighter now and my brain's jumping all over the worst-case stuff, so I'm pretty distracted and not sure I can actually hold onto anything long enough to see if it helps.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice both the spark and the worst-case thoughts at the same time feels like trying to hold onto sand – it slips right through your fingers. 

What if, instead of trying to notice both *while* the worst-case thoughts are still racing, you just noticed what would happen *after* the worst-case thoughts showed up – not to try to make them go away, but just to see what would happen when the guilt and snapping hit, *after* you'd already held onto that tiny spark for a second?

Patient: I guess if I held that little spark first, then when the worst-case stuff hits I might at least have a scrap of proof that I didn't totally lose it. But right now my chest is tight and my head's racing and I can already feel the shame creeping back — it still feels like that scrap vanishes the second I leave the kitchen and I end up snapping at my partner. How is noticing "after" the worst-case actually supposed to stop me from unloading on them? If you're asking me to try this, give me something concrete I can do right after service so I don't blow up at home.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already feeling the shame and tension before you even leave the kitchen, and that's making it hard to imagine noticing "after" the worst-case thoughts. 

Here's something concrete you could try right now, just for 10 seconds: as soon as the next order comes in, make room for the feeling of your chest tightening – without trying to change it, just noticing it as it is. Then, take one tiny step towards serving that order, even if it feels hard – not to prove anything, just to move your body forward. 

What happens if you did that one tiny step, even if the worst-case thoughts are still swirling in the background?

Patient: I tried it in my head just now — my chest unclenched a little when I reached for the ticket and actually started the plate, but my hands were still shaking and my mind was already replaying how I'll snap at home. It gives a tiny scrap of proof I can do it, but the worst-case stuff floods back and I feel more anxious and distracted. How is that supposed to stop me from exploding later? If you're asking me to try this, give me a concrete thing I can do right after service so I don't unload on my partner — something simple I can actually remember when I'm wiped.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tiny scrap of proof you got from holding the plate for a second actually made the worst-case thoughts feel worse, rather than better. 

Here's something concrete you could try right after service, when you're feeling wiped and anxious: take 30 seconds to write down one thing you did that day that matters to you, no matter how small it feels. It could be as simple as "I showed up to work" or "I made a good plate". Just write it down, without thinking about it or trying to make it into something more. 

What happens if you did that one tiny thing, even when the worst-case thoughts are still swirling in the background?

Patient: Yeah, I get the idea, but right now my chest's tight and my brain's all over the place — I don't trust myself to remember to stop and write, and if I do I'll just scribble something dumb and feel worse. How is that supposed to help the big picture? If you're gonna ask me to try it, give me something concrete I can actually do or say in the moment — like an exact one-line thing to write or a 5-word text I can send so I don't blow up at home.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the anxiety is making it hard to trust yourself to take that small step. 

Here's something concrete you could say to yourself in the moment, when your chest is tight and your brain is racing: "I'm here. I'm still here."

Patient: I tried saying it in my head and it felt hollow — my chest's still tight and my brain's already racing. How is a one-line thing like that supposed to stop me from snapping at my partner later? Give me something concrete I can actually do in the five minutes after service — a one-line text I can send or a quick thing to do at the door so I don't unload on them. I'm jittery and distracted right now, so keep it simple.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the one-line thing didn't feel enough to anchor you in the moment. 

Here's something concrete you could do right now, when you're feeling jittery and distracted: as soon as you step out of the kitchen, take 3 slow breaths while standing by the door.

Patient: Okay, I tried the three slow breaths just now and my chest eased a hair, but my brain's still jittery and racing — I can feel the panic creeping back. How is that supposed to stop me from snapping later? If you want me to actually do something after service, give me one exact 3–5 word text or a 10-second thing I can do at the door that I'll actually remember when I'm wiped.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the breaths didn't quite hold. 

Here's one exact 3-word phrase you could send to your partner right now, when you're feeling wiped: "I'm here for you".

Patient: That one sounds hollow — my chest just clenched thinking about saying it, like it's something I say and then mean nothing of it. How is that supposed to stop me from blowing up later? If you want something I'll actually send, give me something honest and small like "I'll be home soon" or "Need a hug later" — or a ten‑second door thing: set keys down, three slow breaths, say to myself "I'm here," then walk in.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the phrase didn't feel authentic. 

Here's a small, honest phrase you could send to yourself right now, when you're feeling wiped: "I'm still here".

Patient: Saying "I'm still here" just makes my chest clamp and feels empty — like I'm pretending I mean it. How is that supposed to stop me from snapping later? Look, give me one exact 3–5 word text I can actually send (no fluff), and a 10‑second door ritual I can remember when I'm wiped — something concrete I can do right after service. I'm jittery and distracted right now, so keep it simple.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the phrase isn't working for you. 

Here's one exact 3-word text you could send to yourself right now: "I matter".

Patient: Saying "I matter" just feels hollow — my chest tightens, I get this wave of shame and feel like a fraud, and my brain goes straight to worst-case. How is that supposed to stop me from unloading later? Give me one exact 3–5 word text I'll actually send (no fluff), and a 10‑second door ritual I can remember when I'm wiped.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the phrase isn't resonating. 

Here's one exact 3-word text you could send to yourself right now: "Okay. Stop".

Patient: No — "Okay. Stop" just feels empty and makes my chest clamp; it sparks that ashamed, fraud-y feeling and I can't breathe. If I have to pick a text I'd actually send: "Need a hug later." The 10‑second door ritual I can maybe remember: set keys down, take 3 slow breaths, say to myself "I'm here," then walk in. I'm jittery and not convinced this'll stop me from blowing up, but I can try it and see what happens.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like "Okay. Stop" didn't feel like a lifeline for you. 

I'm glad you have a different text in mind - "Need a hug later" is a small, honest signal that you care about your partner's feelings. And your 10-second door ritual sounds like a gentle way to ground yourself before walking in. 

Remember, this isn't about "fixing" your feelings or making them go away - it's about showing up in a way that matters to your partner, even when you're not feeling your best. When you try this ritual, what would it mean to you if you *could* make it through the door, even if your chest feels tight and your brain is racing?

Patient: It would mean I managed not to completely fall apart — like a tiny win that I could actually switch out of kitchen mode and not unload the second I see them. But I'm jittery right now, my chest's tight and that shame flickers up like something I can't shake, so it still feels fragile and temporary. How is that supposed to stop me from snapping though? Give me one honest, non‑cheesy line I can say when I walk in if I'm already on edge — something I won't hate myself for later.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tiny win matters to you, even if it feels fragile. 

When you say that shame flickers up, what if you just noticed it, without trying to make it go away? What if you said to yourself, as you walk in, "I'm here, and I'm feeling this. It's okay."

Patient: That line feels like another thing I'm supposed to do — it actually makes me cringe. When I walk in I feel ashamed, like a screw-up, and saying "it's okay" just sounds fake, like I'm pretending. If I had to pick a real line I'd say to them when I'm on edge: "I'm here — can we have a minute?" but I'm still skeptical it'll stop me from blowing up; my chest's tight and my brain's already racing.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like saying "it's okay" feels like a performance for you. 

When you say "I'm here — can we have a minute?", that feels like a way to ask for a break, not to judge yourself. What if, instead of trying to stop your chest from being tight, you just focused on showing up for that minute with them? Not to make everything okay, but just to be present with what's hard for you right now.

Patient: I get the idea, but when I try to “be present” I get hijacked by shame — I keep replaying how I screwed up before and my chest locks, so that minute just becomes a panic show in my head and I snap later. I'll try saying "I'm here — can we have a minute?", but how am I supposed to actually stay with them when my hands are shaking and my brain won't shut off? Give me one tiny, concrete thing to do during that minute so I don't implode.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like your brain is really good at hijacking your presence. 

When you say "I'm here — can we have a minute?", what if you just focused on noticing the sensation of your feet touching the floor? Not to make it stop, but just to notice it. That's a tiny, concrete thing you can do with your body while your brain is still racing.

Patient: My hands are still shaking, my chest's tight, and I'm getting these shame flashes so focusing on my feet feels like decorative advice. How is noticing my feet supposed to stop me from exploding? If I'm going to try that minute, give me one tiny, rock‑solid thing I can do with my hands right then—like squeeze my keys or press my thumb into my palm for 10 seconds—something I won't forget when I'm wrecked.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet feels like a luxury you can't afford when your hands are shaking. 

When you're feeling that tightness and shame, what if you just focused on making one tiny movement with your hands that feels like "I'm still here"? Like squeezing your keys for 10 seconds, like you said. Not to make it stop, but just to notice that you're still holding them.

Patient: I can picture it — gripping the keys, squeezing for ten seconds — but my hands are already shaking and that flash of dropping a plate pops up and I feel like a fraud all over again. Fine, I'll try it, but how is pressing my keys for ten seconds supposed to stop me from snapping at them later when the shame's still roaring? Give me one concrete fallback I can do or say in those first few seconds if the keys don't ground me.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame flash is already making you doubt that tiny movement. 

When you grip the keys and your hands start shaking, what if you just noticed the sensation of the keys in your hand for a second, without trying to make it stop? Then, when that flash of shame comes up, what if you just said to yourself, "I see that. I'm here with that." That's not about making the shame go away, but just about acknowledging it when it shows up.

Patient: I tried picturing that—holding the keys, noticing them, saying “I see that. I’m here with that”—but when the shame hits it just sounds fake and the shaking gets worse. I'm jittery and distracted right now; I can try the keys and the phrase, but how is that supposed to stop me from snapping later? If that doesn't ground me, give me one simple fallback I can actually do in the first 10 seconds so I don't blow up.
