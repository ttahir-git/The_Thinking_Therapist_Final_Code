Patient: Lately I've been stuck on how angry and frustrated I get about the instability with my work — I've been an accountant for years and the recent job uncertainty has knocked the confidence out of me and stirred up a lot of anxiety. I don't know, talking about it feels really uncomfortable and I guess I end up clamming up or trying to change the subject when things get too close.

Therapist: It sounds like being with that discomfort is really tough for you, and that's making it hard to talk about what matters most—like how you want to be able to feel more confident and secure in your work.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's right. I don't know, when I try to sit with it I just get tense and irritable — sometimes I snap at people or shut down — and I don't really like talking about it because it makes me feel exposed. I don't want to go into everything, but it's been getting in the way of things at home and at work.

Therapist: It feels like the anxiety is showing up in your body when you try to stay with that discomfort, and that makes it hard for you to be with it even when it matters.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. My chest gets tight and my jaw clenches, and then I either snap at someone or just shut down — it's embarrassing and I don't like talking about it. I don't know, maybe we could start with something smaller, like how it shows up at home?

Therapist: When it happens at home, like with your partner or kids, what's the smallest thing you could notice that's already there, even when you're trying to avoid it?

Patient: I guess the smallest thing is my jaw — I can feel it clench before I even realize what's happening. I don't know, my voice either goes quiet and tight or I snap and cut people off, and then I feel awful about it. Can we maybe start with how to not react that way when my partner asks about work stuff?

Therapist: Noticing your jaw tightening before it happens might be a tiny step towards making room for what matters. What would happen if, just for a moment, you could make space for that tightness without reacting?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I noticed the tightness I might be able to pause instead of snapping, and maybe answer more calmly instead of shutting down. But it feels really vulnerable to just sit with it — like it could get worse or I'll look weak. Can we stick to something practical, like one tiny thing I could do when my jaw starts to clench?

Therapist: If noticing the tightness feels too vulnerable, what would happen if you just focused on noticing it, without trying to change it right away?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I just noticed it, it might lose some of its urgency and I wouldn't snap so fast. It still feels exposed, but maybe I could try one tiny thing — when my jaw starts to clench, take one slow breath and silently count to three before I answer. Can we try that?

Therapist: That's a small step. When your jaw starts to clench, what would it be like to pause for just one slow breath, and then count to three without doing anything else?

Patient: I don't know... I guess it might give me a tiny pause so I don't blurt something out. It still feels awkward and exposed — I'm worried I'll forget in the moment — but maybe if I practice it a few times or put a little note where I see it at home, I might actually remember to breathe and count.

Therapist: That's a good idea about the note. What would happen if, for just one conversation, you were able to show up with that small pause, even if you forgot to count to three?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I could manage that pause even once, I might not blurt something out and things wouldn't escalate so fast. It would still feel awkward and exposed, but maybe my partner would notice I'm trying and that could make things calmer. Maybe I'll put a little note on the fridge and practice the slow breath a few times a day — could we, I don't know, try practicing it here now?

Therapist: Let's try it now, in this moment. When you notice your jaw starting to clench, just take one slow breath in, and then count to three silently to yourself.

Patient: Okay... I noticed my jaw, took one slow breath and counted to three. I guess it eased the tightness a bit, but I don't know — that took a lot out of me and it's hard to keep going.

Therapist: That takes a lot of courage. It sounds like that small pause mattered to you, even if it was hard to keep going. What would it be like to notice that it eased the tightness, even if you couldn't keep it up for the whole conversation?

Patient: I don't know... I guess if I noticed it eased the tightness, it might make things feel less urgent and help me not shut down so fast. It still takes a lot out of me to keep doing it — could we focus on how I might actually remember the pause when I'm at work?

Therapist: Let's focus on what it might be like to remember that pause when you're at work. What would happen if you were able to show up with that slow breath and counting to three, even if it was just for a moment, while you were talking about work with your partner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? I don't know, I guess if I actually paused once while talking about work with my partner I might not snap and things could stay calmer, but my head feels kind of fuzzy and I worry I'll forget in the moment. Maybe we could talk about simple reminders I could put where I see them at work?

Therapist: Let's explore simple reminders that might help. What would happen if you put a sticky note on your computer or a reminder on your phone with just one word: "pause"?

Patient: I guess that could help. I don't know, it feels a bit silly, but maybe if I put a small "pause" sticky on my monitor or the corner of my keyboard I'd actually notice it when my jaw starts clenching. I could also set a quiet phone reminder during the hours I'm usually busiest — can we figure out which times or places at work would make the most sense so I don't feel self-conscious?

Therapist: Having a reminder that's not too obvious, but still noticeable, might make it easier to remember. What about setting the reminder when you're already on a call or during a break?

Patient: I guess doing it during a break seems less awkward — maybe right after lunch or mid-morning when things usually pile up. I don't know about on calls, that feels obvious, so a sticky on my monitor or a quiet phone vibration during my busiest hours might work better. It's... a lot to think about and I'm kind of worn out just planning it.

Therapist: It sounds like that's a lot to process. What if we just agree to try it for one small thing, like the sticky note on your monitor, and see how that goes?

Patient: Okay, I can try the sticky note on my monitor — I guess I'll write "pause" on it. I don't know, I'm already kind of worn out just planning this and worried I'll forget or it won't help. Can you help me pick what to write so it's noticeable but not embarrassing?

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. What if you just write "Breathe" on the sticky note?

Patient: "Breathe" sounds okay, I guess. Maybe in small letters in the bottom corner of the monitor so it's not so obvious — I don't know, I'm already kind of drained just thinking about this. Could you help me figure out the best spot so I actually see it without feeling silly?

Therapist: Small letters in the bottom corner might be just right. What if we put it right below the clock, where you see it when you glance up at the time?

Patient: Yeah, I guess that could work — right under the clock where I glance at the time. Just thinking about putting it there brings up this tight, annoyed feeling, like I should've handled this better a long time ago. I don't know, I'm kind of drained just planning it, but I'll try to stick it there and see if I notice it.

Therapist: That tightness is showing up again. What if, instead of trying to change it or make it go away, you just notice it - right there, in your chest - while you're putting the sticky note up?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice it I get this tight, hot shame in my chest, like I should've handled things better, and it makes it hard to breathe. I guess I can try to notice that tightness while I stick the note under the clock, but it's already draining and I might go quiet. Could you, I don't know, remind me to take that one slow breath as I do it?

Therapist: I'll remind you to take that one slow breath as you put the note up. When you're ready, just say "okay" and I'll help you breathe it in.

Patient: Okay... I guess. My chest's already tight.

Therapist: Take that one slow breath in...

Patient: Okay... I breathed in and out — it loosened the jaw a bit. But I still feel drained and kind of ashamed, like I should've handled this before, and I don't know, it's hard to keep going. Can we do one more slow breath together? I guess I need the reminder to actually stick the note under the clock.

Therapist: Take another slow breath in... and when you're ready, I'll remind you to put the note under the clock.

Patient: Okay... I breathed in and out — it eased the tightness a little, but I still feel this hot, stupid shame and it's hard to move. I don't know, I guess I'm ready — remind me to put the note under the clock and count with me when I stick it so I don't freeze up.

Therapist: One more slow breath in... 

Ready. I'll remind you to put the note under the clock. When you're ready, just take that one step to put it there. I'll count with you: 1... 2... 3...

Patient: I stuck the note under the clock while you counted — it loosened the tightness a little, but I still feel that hot shame and I'm kind of shaky. I don't know, I guess a quiet phone reminder mid-morning might help — can we try setting one next? I'm already pretty drained doing this.

Therapist: That quiet phone reminder might be a good next step. What if we set it for just 5 minutes from now, when you're already at your desk and can take a small break?

Patient: Okay... I guess set it for five minutes. I'm already worn out and that hot shame's still there, so I'm shaky and not sure I'll notice — when it goes off can you remind me to take a slow breath and count to three with it? I don't know, I might freeze up, but I'll try.

Therapist: I'll set the reminder for 5 minutes from now. When it goes off, I'll remind you to take a slow breath in and count to 3 with me: 1... 2... 3...

Patient: Okay... I'll wait. I'm already kind of drained and that shame's still nagging, but I guess having you count with me helped a little — I don't know, I might still freeze, so please remind me to breathe and count when it goes off.

Therapist: I'll be here to remind you. When the reminder goes off, just take that one slow breath in...

Patient: Okay... I guess I'll wait. I'm still kind of shaky and that stupid shame's nagging at me, so I might not hear it — could you count with me once now so I can practice? And maybe remind me to set the phone to vibrate too? I don't know, I just want to make sure I'll notice it.

Therapist: Let's practice counting together now, just for a moment. When I count to 3, you'll take a slow breath in. Ready? 1...

Patient: 2... 3... Okay, I breathed — it helped a little, but I'm still shaky and that stupid shame's there. I don't know, can you remind me again to put my phone on vibrate and count with me when it goes off? I guess I need you to stay with me on this.

Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's make sure you're set up to notice the reminder. Can you put your phone on vibrate right now? And just to make sure, I'll remind you to take a slow breath and count to 3 with me when it goes off.

Patient: Okay, I put it on vibrate. I don't know, I'm already kind of drained and worried I still won't notice it — could you count with me when it goes off? I might freeze up.
