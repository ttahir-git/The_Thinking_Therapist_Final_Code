--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling really drained and unmotivated lately because the financial stress just never lets up, and it's starting to eat away at my relationship — I can already see it: missed bills, arguments, eviction, her leaving, me ending up alone and ruined. I'm a social worker by trade so I try to think things through, but my mind just churns out the worst-case scenarios like they're facts. I don't know how to make it stop.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Those worst-case scenarios feel really real to you right now, don't they? It sounds like they're connected to a deep fear of losing control and failing as a partner and a provider. When you notice that "churn" in your mind, what happens if you just made room for that fear – not to push it away, but to see it as it is – while you still looked at what matters most in this relationship?

Patient: I wish it were that simple, but the moment I try to "make room" my mind just fills in the whole collapse—I’ll flub something at work, get written up, lose clients, can’t pay rent, we get evicted, she leaves, and I’m left alone and ruined. It doesn’t feel like a feeling to tolerate, it feels like a timeline that’s already started. Honestly, I’m feeling overwhelmed even saying that, because I can’t see how not leaning into those predictions wouldn’t just make it happen. I don’t know how to hold both the fear and what matters at the same time.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That "timeline" feeling is really intense, and it sounds like you're feeling stuck between trying to change it and being able to show up for what matters. When you notice that timeline feeling, what if you could notice it right now, without trying to push it away – just as it is – and then ask yourself: What matters most to you in this relationship, not in spite of that timeline, but because of it?

Patient: What matters most is that we have some steadiness — trust, feeling like I’m not a burden, that I can be present for her instead of collapsing under bills. But the minute I try to imagine holding that and the fear together, my mind scrolls the whole disaster reel: a mistake at work, lost clients, unpaid rent, eviction, her leaving because she can’t watch me fall apart — it’s like I’m watching a movie I can’t pause. I don’t know how to hold both the worry and the thing I actually want; every time I try, the worst outcome feels like the only realistic one. What do I even do with that?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: That "watching a movie" feeling is really vivid, isn't it? It sounds like you're trying to hold onto what matters – that steadiness and trust – while the worst-case scenarios are playing out like a horror movie. What if, instead of trying to stop the movie from playing, you could just notice it playing – like you're watching a movie, not being the movie?

Patient: I wish that would work, but the moment I try to "just watch," my chest tightens and the movie flips into live footage — I start seeing the missed invoice, the write-up, the eviction notice, her packing a bag like it’s already happening. It doesn’t feel like something I can calmly observe; it feels like acknowledging it speeds it up, so I can't treat it like a film.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: When you try to "watch" without the tightness, it feels like it's actually making things worse – like the movie is moving faster. What if, instead of trying to stop the movie from playing, you could try to notice what happens when you notice it playing – like what happens in your chest when the tightness shows up, right there in the moment?

Patient: It’s like a metal band clamps around my ribs — my breaths get short, my heart kicks up, my hands go cold and clammy. As that happens the story floods in faster: I see the missed invoice, the eviction notice, her packing — the bodily stuff and the movie fuse together so I can’t tell which is real. The harder I try to just notice it, the more the tightness feels like confirmation the disaster timeline is already rolling, so I don’t trust that “noticing” will help.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness in your chest is actually becoming the story – "This means the disaster is real, I'll never be able to do anything to stop it." When that tightness shows up, what would happen if you made room for it, not to make it go away, but to see what matters – like that connection to your partner and the steadiness you want – even as that tightness is there?

Patient: If I try to make room, the tightness just feels like proof the timeline's started — and then the movie goes live: I flub something at work, lose clients, get written up, can't cover rent, we get an eviction notice, she packs and leaves and I'm left alone and ruined. I can't treat it like a thing to observe because the bodily panic and the disaster-story fuse together and feel inevitable. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed just saying that out loud — I don't see how 'making room' wouldn't just speed it up.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and the timeline feeling are already so entwined that it feels like you can't even try to make room for it – like trying to make room would be what matters most, not being able to stop the disaster. What if, instead of trying to make room for it, you could just notice what matters most to you right now, even if the tightness is there – like what matters most to you about your relationship with your partner, and what you're willing to do to hold onto that connection, even if the timeline feels inevitable?

Patient: What matters most is steadiness — trust that I’m not a burden, that I can be present for her instead of collapsing under bills. I'd try to be honest about the money, tighten the budget, look for extra shifts or freelance work, maybe start couples counseling so we can face it together. But the minute I plan that, my head runs the movie: me trying to work more, flubbing something, losing clients, missing rent, getting an eviction notice while she watches me fail and packs a bag — it feels like those efforts just set the timeline in motion. I’m overwhelmed even saying it; I don’t see how trying to hold on won’t just make the collapse happen faster.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to make plans is actually what feels like setting the timeline in motion – like you're trying to push the disaster away, but it's already inside you. What if, instead of trying to stop the timeline, you could just notice what matters most – the connection with your partner and the steadiness you want – and do one tiny thing towards that, not to change the timeline, but because it feels connected to what matters?

Patient: I wish I could, but the second I picture doing something small—telling her the truth or picking up an extra shift—my head shoots straight to how it goes wrong: I miss a meeting, botch a client call, get written up, lose income, can’t pay rent, we get an eviction notice, she packs and leaves. I'm feeling really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down? I honestly don't see how a tiny step wouldn't just set the collapse in motion.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to do a tiny step, but the worry about what goes wrong is so strong that it feels like it's pushing you away. Can I help you notice what's happening in your body when you think "I miss a meeting, botch a client call..."?

Patient: I can feel it right now — a tight metal band around my chest, breath shallow, heart pounding, hands trembling and cold, stomach in knots. As that happens my thoughts sprint: everything collapses into the eviction-and-her-leaving movie and I can't focus on anything else, like my head's hijacked. It makes me want to either run or shut down, and I'm feeling really overwhelmed just saying it — can we slow down?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and the thoughts are really strong right now. Can you notice what matters to you in this moment, not about stopping the thoughts or the tightness, but about what's happening in your body when it matters – like what's it like to feel that tightness, or to be with your partner, even when the thoughts are there?

Patient: I can feel that metal band again — chest tight, breathing shallow, hands cold, and my voice goes thin whenever she's close. The minute I try to be present with her my head hijacks me with that eviction-and-her-leaving movie — I literally see her packing while I'm apologizing and it feels like live footage, so I can't actually connect. I'm really overwhelmed saying this; I don't see how 'noticing' helps — it just feels like proof the collapse is already happening, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness and the thoughts is actually making it feel like the collapse is happening. Can I ask, what would it be like to notice the tightness and the thoughts *while you're still holding onto what matters to you about being with your partner* – not to stop the thoughts or the tightness, but to see if you can be with your partner even when the thoughts are there?

Patient: I’m trying, but the moment I try to hold both the tightness and what matters—her trust, some steadiness—my head flips to live footage: missed invoices, a write‑up at work, an eviction notice, her packing. My chest clamps, breathing gets shallow, my hands go cold, and I can’t actually be with her because the movie’s playing so loudly it drowns everything else out. I’m really overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down? I don’t see how being with her is possible when that timeline feels like the only realistic outcome.

Therapist: It sounds like the tightness and the thoughts are still feeling like they're controlling what you can and can't do – like the timeline is what matters, and being with your partner is impossible because of it. Can I help you notice what would happen if you *saw* the tightness and the thoughts, not as something that matters, but just as something in your body – like what would it be like to see them there, even if it still feels like the timeline is happening?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just "seeing" the tightness supposed to help? When I try that, it feels like proof the timeline's already rolling: missed invoices, a write‑up, eviction notice, her packing, and noticing it just makes it feel more real. I'm feeling really overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down? I honestly don't see how that would change anything.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness just feels like more of the same – the timeline showing up, and you feeling like it's already happening. I want to try something different. Instead of noticing the tightness, what if we tried to notice what's left when the tightness is there – what matters to you about being with your partner, what matters to you about taking care of yourself, what matters to you about being steady?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how am I supposed to notice what's left when the tightness already feels like proof the timeline's started? What matters is steadiness and trust, that I'm not a burden, that I can be honest about the money and maybe pick up extra shifts or tighten the budget. But the minute I plan any of that my head goes straight to the movie—I flub a client call, get written up, lose income, miss rent, get an eviction notice, and she packs her things—and I feel really overwhelmed saying that, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like planning to do something to help with the financial stress is what feels like setting the timeline in motion – like you're trying to push the disaster away, but it's already inside you. And that feeling of overwhelm is really strong. Can I ask, what would it be like to notice what matters to you about being with your partner while you're still feeling that overwhelm – not to change the overwhelm, but to see if you can be with your partner even when the thoughts are there?

Patient: I don't know how to do that — every time I try to hold what matters and the overwhelm at once, the movie just gets louder: missed invoice, written up, clients gone, can't pay rent, eviction, her packing, me alone and ruined. It feels impossible to actually be with her when I'm already watching that collapse like it's happening, and I'm really overwhelmed saying that, so can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like it feels impossible to be with your partner when the thoughts are already there. I want to try something small. Can you notice what would happen if you *allowed* yourself to feel the overwhelm for just 10 seconds – not to change it, but just to see what it's like – while you still held onto what matters to you about being with your partner?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — though I don't see how ten seconds will help. I let myself feel it for about ten seconds and the metal band around my ribs tightened, breathing got shallow, my hands went cold, and my head immediately fired up the whole eviction-and-her-leaving movie — missed invoice, write‑up, eviction, her packing — like it's already happening. I'm really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down?


--- Turn 15 ---

Therapist: It sounds like even for just 10 seconds, the overwhelm came back – the thoughts started again. I want to try something different. Instead of trying to hold onto what matters while the overwhelm is there, what if you tried to notice the thoughts *as they came up* – not to change them, but to see them as they appeared – and then you could make room for what matters to you about being with your partner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the thoughts supposed to help? The second I pay attention they spiral into the movie: miss a meeting, get written up, lose clients, can't pay rent, eviction notice, her packing, me alone and ruined. I'm really overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thoughts just makes them worse. I want to try something that might feel strange, but bear with me. When you notice the thoughts spiraling into the movie, what would happen if you didn't try to stop them – but instead, just *allowed* them to be there, like a cloud passing by – while you looked at your partner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is pretending they're clouds supposed to help? When I try that, they don't drift; they harden into live footage—missed invoice, write‑up, eviction notice, her packing—and my chest clamps so tight I can't think. I'm really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down? I don't see how "letting them be" wouldn't just make the collapse happen.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even imagining the thoughts as clouds feels like it's not working – they're still hard and hurting. I want to try something that might feel really small, but can you try noticing what would happen if you *saw* the thought "I'll miss an invoice" not as a problem, but just as a thought – without trying to do anything with it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is seeing "I'll miss an invoice" as just a thought supposed to help? When I try that, it never stays just a thought: my chest clamps, breathing gets shallow, and the movie goes live—missed invoice, write‑up, lost clients, eviction notice, her packing. I'm really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like seeing the thought that way doesn't change the physical pain or the thoughts that follow. I want to try something that might feel really different. Instead of trying to see the thought as just a thought, what if you noticed what's happening in your body when you think about not being able to pay the invoice – not the thought itself, but what's showing up in your body when that thought is there?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? But when I try: a metal band clamps my ribs, my breath gets shallow, my heart pounds, my hands go cold and a sick knot lands in my stomach, and I get a faint, dizzy feeling. As all that shows up the movie kicks in—missed invoice, eviction, her leaving—and I feel frantic and scattered; I'm really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening in your body when you think about not being able to pay the invoice actually makes the physical sensations worse – the metal band gets tighter, your breath gets even shallower. I want to try something that might feel really small. Can you notice what happens to the movie – the thoughts about eviction and leaving – when the metal band is there, not because you're trying to stop it, but because you're just noticing it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just noticing supposed to change it? When I pay attention to the metal band, the movie doesn't fade; it thickens and goes live: missed invoice, a write‑up, clients gone, an eviction notice, her packing while I'm shaking and apologizing. My chest clamps harder, breathing gets tinier, my hands go cold and my head races—I'm really overwhelmed right now, can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the metal band doesn't make the movie fade away – it actually makes it feel like it's happening right there, in your body. I want to try something that might feel really gentle. Can you make room for the movie to be there, not because you're trying to stop it, but because you're noticing it as it is – like a cloud passing by – while you're still looking at your partner?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — every time I try to make room my chest locks up and the movie goes live: missed invoice, a write‑up at work, the eviction notice on the table, her stuffing a bag while I'm apologizing. I try to look at her but all I see is that footage and my hands go cold, breath gets shallow, my head races and I can't focus on her at all. I'm really overwhelmed saying this — can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like making room for the movie isn't working – it's actually getting worse. I want to try something that might feel really different. Instead of trying to make room for the movie, what if you tried to notice what matters to you about being with your partner *while* the movie is playing – not because you're trying to stop the movie, but because you're noticing it as it is?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how am I supposed to notice what matters when that movie's already drowning everything out? The moment I try, my chest clamps, my hands tremble, and I see the eviction notice and her packing like it's happening right now, so I can't actually look at her or feel steady. I'm really overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the movie is already overwhelming you, and even trying to notice what matters is getting in the way. I want to try something that might feel really small. Can you notice what's happening in your body right now, just for a moment – not because you're trying to stop the movie, but because you're curious about what's happening inside you?

Patient: Okay, I'll try — but I'm not sure I follow how this helps. Right now it's that metal band around my ribs, breath so shallow I forget to breathe, heart pounding, hands cold and clammy, stomach in knots and a dizzy flutter; as I notice it the movie kicks in—missed invoice, write‑up, eviction notice, her packing—and I get frantic and scattered. I'm really overwhelmed saying that, can we slow down?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening in your body isn't making the movie go away – it's actually making it feel like it's happening even more strongly. I want to try something that might feel really gentle. Can you imagine that the movie is just one small part of your whole experience – like a scene playing on a screen, but not the whole world?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how's picturing it as a small scene supposed to help? The minute I try that the metal band tightens, my breath gets tiny, and the movie doesn't stay small: missed invoice, write‑up, eviction notice, her packing like it's already happening. I'm really overwhelmed saying that—can we slow down?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like picturing the movie as a small scene isn't helping – it's actually making it feel like it's happening even more strongly. I want to try something that might feel really different. Can you notice what happens to the movie when you notice the feeling of overwhelm in your body – the tightness, the shortness of breath, the pounding heart – not because you're trying to stop it, but because you're curious about what happens when that feeling is present?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing supposed to change anything? When I try to notice the overwhelm the metal band clamps tighter, breath gets tiny, my heart hammers, my hands go cold, and the movie goes full live—missed invoice, a write‑up, an eviction notice, her packing—and I get frantic and jumpy. I'm really overwhelmed saying that; can we slow down?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the overwhelm isn't changing what's happening – it's actually making it feel like it's happening even more strongly. I want to try something that might feel really small. Can you notice what happens when you *don't* try to stop the movie – when you just notice the feeling of overwhelm in your body, without trying to change it – what happens to the movie for just a moment?

Patient: I tried that—just noticing the overwhelm without trying to stop it. The metal band clamps down harder, breath gets tiny, my heart races and my hands go cold; for a split second the movie snarls down to a whisper, but then it snaps back to live footage—missed invoice, a write‑up, the eviction notice on the table, her stuffing a bag. It just makes me frantic and scattered; I can't hold it, and I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down?
