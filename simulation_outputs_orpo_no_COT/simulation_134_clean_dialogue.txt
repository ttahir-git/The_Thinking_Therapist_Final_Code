Patient: I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — every little perceived failure feels like proof I'm back to the kid who couldn't keep up in school, even though I eventually found success as an artist. The recent move's made the anxiety louder and I'm replaying those academic failures more than I'd like. Honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried talking about this before and it doesn't seem to change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like being stuck in that loop of harsh self-criticism is really weighing on you, especially with the added pressure of the move. When you notice that criticism showing up, what's happening in your body right then — like where the tension or tightness is in your chest or shoulders?

Patient: Usually it starts as a tightness across my chest and a hollow feeling in my stomach, and my shoulders pull up like I'm bracing for something. My breathing gets shallow and my hands go a bit clammy. How is noticing that supposed to help? I've been told to "pay attention" before and it just ends up making me feel more stuck.

Therapist: The physical sensations you're describing seem really connected to what matters to you, like feeling stuck and unable to move forward. When you notice that tightness and that hollow feeling, what's one small thing you could do with that tightness right now, just for a moment — not to change it, but to notice it while you're still holding onto your valued action of creating art?

Patient: Maybe I could put a hand on my chest and take a couple of slow breaths, or set a two-minute timer and make a tiny sketch so I'm still doing something creative. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing and quick exercises before and they just make me more aware of the panic, not less.

Therapist: It sounds like those strategies didn't quite give you the relief you were hoping for. When you think about what matters most to you — like making art and expressing yourself — what would it be like to make room for that feeling of panic while you're still doing it?

Patient: I guess it would mean trying to let the panic be there while I still make marks — like carrying a buzzing radio while I work — which sounds... exhausting. Maybe I could do it, but I'm worried that "making room" just becomes tolerating the misery instead of fixing it. How is that supposed to help? I've tried accepting the feelings before and it mostly just made me more resigned, not better.

Therapist: The worry that accepting the panic would mean giving up trying to change it — that feels really important to you. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the panic, what if you could just notice it as a part of the story you're telling yourself about making art?

Patient: I get the idea, but... how is that supposed to help? The story that runs is pretty loud — I'm a fraud, I'm back to that kid who couldn't keep up — and when I notice it I just clamp down and stop making anything honest. I've tried reframing and "noticing" before and it mostly felt like putting a nicer label on the same old shame.

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck with the feeling of being a fraud, even when you're trying to notice it as a story. What if, instead of trying to change that story, what if you could just notice it as a story — without trying to fix it, or change it, or even notice it as "bad"?

Patient: Maybe I can try noticing it as a story, but honestly — how is that supposed to help? When I step back and label it like that I still feel like I'm admitting defeat, like the old kid who couldn't keep up finally caught up with me and I shut down and make safe, dishonest work. I can try it, but I'm skeptical it'll change anything different from what I've tried before.

Therapist: It sounds like the skepticism is still connected to the feeling of being the kid who couldn't keep up. What if, instead of trying to change the story, what if you could try making room for it — not to fix it, but to see what would happen if you made space for that feeling, while still holding onto what matters to you?

Patient: Okay, I can try making room for it, but I'm skeptical — it just feels like tolerating the misery instead of fixing anything. How is that supposed to help? If we do it, I'd prefer a concrete, time-limited experiment — like a ten-minute sketch where I try to notice the self-criticism without reacting — so we can tell if it actually changes anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a concrete way to test if making room for the feeling matters. Would you be willing to try that ten-minute sketch, not as a way to "fix" the feeling, but just to see what happens when you notice it while making art?

Patient: All right — I'll try the ten-minute sketch as an experiment, but I'm skeptical it will change anything. How is that supposed to help? I'd like to set a timer, try to notice the self-criticism without reacting, and if it gets overwhelming can we pause for a quick check-in halfway through.

Therapist: When you're ready, you can start that timer and make space for the feeling while you create. When the timer goes off, we can check in together and see what happened — not to judge it, but to notice what matters to you.

Patient: Okay — I'm setting a ten-minute timer and starting now. 

It's about five minutes in and the self-criticism just kicked up — "this is crap, you're a fraud" — my chest tightened and my hands got clammy, and I felt like retreating into safe, boring marks. Can we pause for that quick check-in? Honestly, how is this supposed to help — it just feels like rehearsing the same panic.

Therapist: It sounds like the self-criticism showed up as usual. When you notice that "this is crap, you're a fraud" story, what's one tiny thing you could do with that feeling right now — not to change it, but to notice it while you're still holding onto your valued action of creating art?

Patient: I can try putting my hand on my chest and keep making one slow continuous mark with the other hand, and when the thought shows up I’ll quietly label it “that’s the critic” — just notice it and keep drawing. I'm more on edge now, my hands are shaking and it’s harder to focus, so I’m worried I’ll just ruminate instead. Honestly, how is that supposed to help? Can you give me a quick check-in at the halfway point like we agreed?

Therapist: Noticing the thought as "that's the critic" and keeping drawing sounds like a good experiment. When you feel the edge and your hands shaking, what's one tiny step you could take with your drawing that feels connected to what matters to you — even if it's just a tiny mark? 

(I'll wait for 5 minutes to check in with you.)

Patient: I’ll try making one slow, deliberate continuous line across the page — just one mark, thinking of that first brushstroke that once felt honest in my work. My hands are still shaking, so I’ll keep it light and steady rather than trying to force anything precise. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? Please check in at the halfway point like we agreed — I’m on edge and I don’t trust I’ll get through it without that.

Therapist: Making that first mark with the intention of that honest brushstroke sounds like a small step towards what matters to you. When you notice the self-criticism showing up again, what would it mean to notice it while you're making that slow, steady line — not to change it, but to see what happens to your body and the drawing when you hold onto that small action? 

(I'll wait for 5 minutes to check in with you.)

Patient: I'll try to keep that slow steady line, but I'm more on edge now — my chest's tighter, breathing's quick, and my hands are shaking so it's harder to stay with the intention. How is that supposed to help? Please do the halfway check-in like we agreed in about 2–3 minutes, and give me one simple grounding cue then — just a word to bring me back to the mark.

Therapist: It sounds like the edge is still there. When you notice your chest tightening and your hands shaking, what's one tiny thing you could do with that feeling right now — not to change it, but to notice it while you're still holding onto that slow, steady line?

Patient: Okay — I'll try this: when the tightness comes up I'll quietly name it "tightness" and keep making that slow continuous line, and on each exhale I'll let the line ease a little so the breath and the mark sync. I'm really on edge and skeptical about whether this will do anything — how is that supposed to help? Please check in in about 2 minutes and give me the one-word cue "steady" like we agreed.

Therapist: Noticing the tightness as "tightness" and keeping the line while syncing it with the breath sounds like a small step towards what matters to you. When you notice your skepticism, what would it mean to try this for just one more breath — not to change the tightness, but to see what happens when you hold onto that slow line and let the breath ease it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try one more breath and keep that slow line. My chest's still tight and my hands are shaking, and I don't know, it hardly feels like anything's changing. How is that supposed to help? Please say "steady" in a minute like we agreed — I need that anchor.

Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto the small action, even when it feels like nothing's changing. When you notice your chest tightening again, I'll wait for that one word: "steady".

Patient: It's tightening now — my chest's clamping and my hands are shaking. Please say "steady" like we agreed. Honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: Steady

Patient: Steady. Saying that actually loosened my chest a little and my breath slowed—my hands are still shaky but the line feels a touch less frantic. I'm still skeptical — how is that supposed to help long-term? Can we keep going for another minute with you saying "steady" every 15 seconds, then a quick check-in?

Therapist: Steady

Patient: Okay — that actually loosened my chest a bit and my breath slowed. I'm still shaky and skeptical it will make a lasting difference — how is that supposed to help? Please say "steady" again every 15 seconds for a minute, then let's do that quick check-in.

Therapist: Steady

Patient: Okay — that actually helped some, my chest eased a bit but now I'm jumpy and my thoughts are scattering so it's harder to stay with the line. Can you say "steady" every 15 seconds for another minute like we agreed, then do the quick check-in? I'm still skeptical this will change anything long-term — how is that supposed to help? I feel like I could bail any second.

Therapist: Steady

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you keep saying "steady," but I don't really get how this ties back to the bigger thing that's messing me up. My chest's still tight, my hands are shaking, and my thoughts are all over the place. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can you keep saying "steady" every 15 seconds for another minute and then do that quick check-in like we agreed?

Therapist: Steady

Patient: Steady. Okay — that helped a little, my chest eased but I'm still jumpy and distracted and my thoughts keep flitting everywhere; I'm not sure I follow how repeating "steady" actually ties back to the bigger problem. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can you please say "steady" every 15 seconds for a minute like we agreed, then do the quick check-in? I'll keep the slow line going.

Therapist: Steady

Patient: Steady. Okay — that did ease my chest again, but I still don't see how saying a word every few seconds fixes the bigger loop where that kid voice calls me a fraud. How is that supposed to help long-term — is the point to interrupt the spiral or to change my body response? Can we pause for a quick 2-minute check-in now and actually talk about where that "fraud" story came from, because I'm skeptical these little anchors will stick unless we get to that.

Therapist: Let's take a pause and explore that "fraud" story together. What do you think happened when you were that kid, and how did that story start showing up for you as an adult?

Patient: I was that kid who couldn't keep up — teachers told me to try harder, classmates moved on, and I just felt stuck and stupid. Those messages got baked in, so now any little stumble makes that old voice shout that I'm a fraud, like the past is catching up to me. I did find success later as an artist, but it didn't quiet the voice — it just made me terrified of failing in public, so I retreat into safe, dishonest work a lot. Okay—how is talking about that supposed to help? If we're going to dig into the past, what practical step could actually change how I react when that voice shows up?

Therapist: It sounds like those early messages were really powerful, and they've been driving that self-criticism ever since. When you think about what matters to you as an artist, what matters most to you is being able to create something honest and meaningful. What would it take for you to notice that "fraud" story showing up while you're making that mark on the page, not as a reason to stop creating, but as a chance to see what matters to you right then?

Patient: Maybe a tiny, stupid ritual would help — like quietly saying “that’s the kid,” pressing my thumb to my forefinger, then forcing myself to make one deliberate honest stroke within 30 seconds. If we treat it as a short, time-limited experiment (one minute max) I might actually test whether I can keep going instead of shutting down. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? Can we try that now and check what actually changes after one minute?

Therapist: That's a great idea about the tiny ritual. By treating it as a short experiment, you're making room to test what matters to you. When you notice that "fraud" story showing up, what would it mean to you if you could just make that one deliberate honest stroke, even if it feels scary?

Patient: I think it would mean choosing the work over the voice — a tiny act of defiance that proves I can keep going. But honestly, how is that supposed to help long-term? I'll try the ritual now: thumb to forefinger, say "that's the kid," then one deliberate stroke within 30 seconds, and let's pause after one minute to see if anything actually changed.

Therapist: I'll wait for the one minute.

Patient: Okay — I did it. Thumb to forefinger, said "that's the kid," forced one deliberate stroke within 30 seconds. My chest eased a little and the critic quieted for a beat; the stroke was messy but felt more honest than my usual safe stuff. I'm still skeptical — the voice is already circling again saying it was a fluke. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can we try one more short run and then figure out a concrete practice I can actually use in the studio so this doesn't just disappear after the first try?

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing some small steps forward, even when the voice is circling again. When you notice that critic showing up again, what would it mean to you if you could just make that deliberate honest stroke again, even if it feels like a fluke? 

And I'm curious - what matters most to you about making that stroke in the studio - is it about creating something true to yourself, or something else?

Patient: Making that deliberate stroke again would feel like choosing the work over the voice — a tiny proof that I don't have to stop every time the critic yells, even if it seems like a fluke. What matters most is honesty: making something that's mine, messy or imperfect, instead of safe stuff that erases me; that one stroke reconnects me to why I make art. But seriously — how is that supposed to help long-term? I need a concrete, repeatable ritual I can use in the studio so it doesn't just peter out after the first try — can we map out a simple routine I can actually stick to?
