Patient: I'm a social worker in my late twenties and starting this new, demanding role has left me pretty overwhelmed. Lately I've been getting intense anxiety in social situations — even small hangouts with a few close friends make me so on edge that I just avoid them. I don't know, I want to be there but then I just... freeze.

Therapist: It sounds like being in those small, familiar social situations feels like a constant weight, making it hard for you to show up for your friends. What would happen if, for just one of those small gatherings, you made room for that weight without having to choose between being there and staying frozen?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd still feel really tense, but maybe if I promised myself I'd only stay for 30 minutes I could manage to show up. Or I could plan a quick exit strategy, like stepping outside or having a text to bail if it spikes. I'm getting kind of awkward talking about this, can we stick to small, practical things I can try?

Therapist: Let's focus on that practical plan for 30 minutes. What would it mean to you if you could show up for that small gathering without needing to have a full plan for how to leave when it gets too tough?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would feel like I'm not letting anxiety run everything, like I could actually enjoy things a little instead of missing out. Saying that makes me kind of weirdly vulnerable, though, so can we stick to the concrete stuff? Like, what should I do in the first 10 minutes to make that 30-minute plan actually work?

Therapist: Let's get back to that concrete stuff. What small action could you take in the first 10 minutes to start showing up for that 30-minute gathering, even if it feels like a tiny step?

Patient: I don't know — I guess in the first 10 minutes I could park or arrive a little early so I can pick a spot by the door, do three slow breaths or a quick 5-4-3 grounding exercise, and spend that time leaning into a short chat with the one friend I feel safest with. Maybe I'd text that friend beforehand that I'm only staying for a bit so I don't have to invent an exit, but I'm getting kind of awkward saying all this out loud. Can we keep it to simple steps like that?

Therapist: Let's keep it simple. What would happen if you did those three slow breaths before leaning into that short chat with your friend, without needing to think about whether you're doing it "right" or not?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it might slow my chest down enough that I can answer a question or two instead of panicking. Maybe I'd feel a little less trapped and actually stick around the thirty minutes. I'm getting kind of weird talking about this, can we stay on more concrete tricks I can try in the moment?

Therapist: Let's stay with that concrete trick. What would it take for you to do those three slow breaths right before you lean into that short chat with your friend, without getting caught up in thoughts about what's "wrong" with your body?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd need a clear, tiny cue so I don't overthink it, like setting a five-minute timer or a vibration on my phone when I arrive, or a little mantra in my head like "one breath, one step." Maybe practicing the breaths a few times at home so they feel less weird would help too. I'm getting kind of awkward saying this — can we figure out a simple sentence I could text my friend beforehand so I don't fumble?

Therapist: Let's focus on the simple sentence. What would you say to your friend if you texted, "Hey, I'm looking forward to seeing you, but I'm going to take a break after a bit if I need to"?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd text something short and casual like: "Hey! Looking forward to tonight. Heads up I might step out after a bit if I need to, just so you know." I'm kind of awkward saying that out loud — can we go back to the breathing cue or the little mantra so I don't panic about wording?

Therapist: Let's go back to the breathing. What would happen if you set a 5-minute timer and said to yourself, "One breath, one step," as soon as you arrive, without thinking about what to say next?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would give me something concrete to hang onto so my thoughts don't race; the timer would make it feel doable and the mantra might make the first words out of my mouth less scary. Maybe my heart would slow enough that I could answer a question instead of freezing, and I'd actually stick around for the thirty minutes. I'm getting kind of awkward saying this — if that doesn't work, can we figure out a quick backup like a practiced exit line or a friend signal?

Therapist: Let's focus on the timer and mantra. What would it mean to you if, right now, you could say to yourself, "One breath, one step," and then simply *show up* at that small gathering, without needing a backup plan?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would mean I'm not letting anxiety decide everything, like I could actually be there without spiraling. Saying that feels kind of vulnerable and weird, so can we focus on how to practice the mantra and set the timer so it actually feels doable when I get there?

Therapist: Let's make it concrete. What's one small step you can take right now to practice saying "one breath, one step" to yourself, so it feels like a real choice when you're at the gathering?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could set a phone alarm right now labeled "one breath, one step" and actually do three slow breaths and say the phrase out loud three times so it stops feeling weird. Maybe I could also record a quick voice note of myself saying it and play it in the car before I go. I'm getting kind of awkward practicing this — can we pick one of those and make it the plan?

Therapist: Let's go with the alarm. What would it take for you to set that alarm, say the phrase three times, and do three slow breaths, even if it feels a little awkward?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it'd take something super simple and immediate so I don't chicken out. I could set the alarm right now labeled "one breath, one step," do the three slow breaths and say the phrase out loud once or twice, and maybe record a 5‑second voice note to play in the car so I don't have to depend on memory. I'm getting kind of awkward saying this out loud — can we make that the plan and, like, lock it in?

Therapist: Let's lock it in. Set that alarm now, say the phrase three times, do three slow breaths, and record the 5-second voice note. When you're ready, we can make it a commitment to show up at that small gathering tomorrow.

Patient: Okay — I set the alarm labeled "one breath, one step," said the phrase three times, did the three slow breaths, and recorded the 5‑second voice note. I guess I can try to show up tomorrow and stick around for up to 30 minutes, but I don't know — I'm already feeling kind of shaky about committing. Can we quickly make a super-short exit line or friend signal I can use if it spikes, like "I need some fresh air" or a thumbs-up text, so it doesn't feel like I'm failing if I leave? I'm getting kind of awkward talking about this — can we run through that exit line once now?

Therapist: Let's focus on the exit line. What if you could say "I need some fresh air" right now, even if it feels like a tiny escape, and then text that to your friend?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could say that. Maybe something like, "Hey, I'm stepping out for some fresh air — be right back," feels short and honest without drama. I'm kind of awkward saying it out loud though, can we run through me texting it once so it doesn't feel so weird?

Therapist: Let's try it. What would happen if you texted "Hey, I'm stepping out for some fresh air — be right back" to your friend right now, and then actually stepped outside for a minute, just to show yourself that it's okay to take care of that feeling?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could text that. It feels weird to actually send it, though, so can we run through it once? I'll say what I'd type and then, if it sounds okay, I'll send it and step outside for a minute. I'm getting kind of awkward saying this, so can you stay with me while I do it?

Therapist: Let's run through it together. What's the first thing you'd type?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd type: "Hey, stepping out for some fresh air — be right back." It feels weird to actually send, so can you stay with me while I do it and then step outside for a minute?

Therapist: I'll stay with you. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, type those words: "Hey, stepping out for some fresh air — be right back."

Patient: I typed and sent: "Hey, stepping out for some fresh air — be right back." I stepped outside for a minute. I don't know — I feel kind of stupid and my chest's tight, like this frustrating shame that I'm failing at something simple. Can you stay with me while I breathe out here for a bit? I'm awkward about this.

Therapist: You typed and sent the message, and you took that small step outside. Your chest is tight, and that shame is showing up. What if you could notice that tightness, like a small weight in your chest, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try. It feels like a heavy knot under my breastbone, like my chest is tight and hot, and there's this stupid, sinking shame like I'm failing at something tiny but obvious. I want to make it stop or run away, but maybe I can just notice it. Can you stay with me and give me one really simple thing to do right now to just sit with it without trying to fix it?

Therapist: Notice the sensation in your chest: the tightness, the heat, the sinking feeling. That's what's showing up right now. When you're ready, I want you to notice one thing about that knot – its location. Just observe it being there, under your breastbone, without trying to move it or make it go away. Can you do that for just a tiny second?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try. It's right under my breastbone, hot and tight, and I can feel this stupid, sinking shame like I messed up again. I'm kind of overwhelmed — can you stay with me and give me one tiny thing to do while I just notice it?

Therapist: You're noticing the sensation, the location, and the feeling of shame. That's a small step. When you're ready, I want you to notice just one thing about your breath while that knot is there – its sound. Can you hear it?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can hear it, this quiet whoosh that's somehow loud in my head, and it makes that sinking shame flare up like I'm failing at something small again. I'm frustrated and kind of shaky — can you give me one tiny breathing cue to do right now while I hold this?

Therapist: You're noticing your breath's sound. That's a small anchor. When the knot feels tight, and shame shows up, I want you to notice just one small part of your breath – the sensation of it moving in, like a tiny whisper: "in." Not trying to change it, just noticing that whisper when it's there. Can you do that with me?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try. "In" — I can hear that tiny whisper, but my chest jumps and this stupid shame flares up and I feel like an idiot, like I already messed up. Can you stay with me and quietly count on the out-breath, like "one," so I don't fumble?

Therapist: Your chest jumps, and shame shows up. That's okay. When you're ready, I'll quietly count with you on the out-breath. Let's start with just one small step. When you exhale, I'll say "one" and you can breathe out. Ready when you are?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'm ready. (exhale) one. I can feel it loosening a tiny bit but the shame's still loud, like I'm being dumb about this. Can you keep counting a couple more so I don't fumble?

Therapist: (exhale) two. The shame's still there, but it's not taking over. You're noticing it, and that's small. (pause) When you're ready, let's try to notice what happens when you think, "I'm being dumb." What does that feeling do, just for a second?

Patient: I don't know — I guess when I think "I'm being dumb" my chest just clamps down harder, my breath gets tiny and fast, and this hot, sinking shame floods in so loud it drowns everything else. Then my head goes messy and I feel stupid for even being here, which makes me want to run or pretend nothing's wrong. Can we just keep counting a few more breaths together? I'm getting kind of awkward and I need something simple to hang on to.

Therapist: That's a lot to notice. When you think "I'm being dumb," your chest clamps down, breath gets tiny, and shame floods in. That's a big pattern. When you're ready, let's count together one more time: (exhale) three. Can you just notice your breath moving out, even if your head is getting messy?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can notice it moving out. My chest loosens a tiny bit but that stupid shame's still loud, like I'm failing at something obvious. Can we keep counting a few more breaths? I need a simple thing to hang on to.

Therapist: (exhale) four. Your chest is still there, but it's not squeezing as tight. Notice that tiny looseness. When you're ready, I want you to notice one small thing that feels safe about being here – even with that shame.

Patient: I don't know — I guess one small thing that feels safe is that you're still here and not making me explain everything perfectly, and the counting actually gives me something to hang on to. Even so my chest's still hot and that stupid shame is loud, like I already messed up. Can we keep counting a few more breaths together?

Therapist: That's a small anchor. The counting does feel safe. When you're ready, let's keep counting: (exhale) five. Notice the breath moving out, even if the shame's still there.

Patient: I don't know — I guess (exhale) six. It loosens a bit but that stupid shame's still yelling at me like I already messed up and I'm frustrated with myself. Can we keep counting a few more? I need that simple thing to hang on to — I'm getting kind of awkward about this.

Therapist: (exhale) seven. The counting's still there, and you're noticing it. When you're ready, let's try to notice something about the shame – not what it's saying, but what's underneath it. What might be scared of getting noticed?

Patient: I don't know — I guess underneath it all I'm scared people will see I'm not competent, like I'll be exposed. It makes me feel small and really frustrated, and I'm kind of panicking about it — can we just keep counting breaths for a few more? I need that instead of digging into it right now.
