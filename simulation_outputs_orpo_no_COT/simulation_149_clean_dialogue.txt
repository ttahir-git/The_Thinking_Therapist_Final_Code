Patient: Hi — lately I’ve been ruminating a lot about the breakup; it’s left me in this weird low-motivation state that’s paradoxically both numb and affect-laden. As a developer I default to systematizing my inner life—abstract metaphors and elaborate rationalizations—so I end up talking about sadness instead of actually inhabiting it. It’s starting to leak into my relationships and work, and I’m noticing I keep using intellectual frameworks to avoid the rawness.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to systematize your thoughts about sadness is actually making it harder for you to connect with that feeling. When you notice that "rawness" in your work or relationships, what would happen if you just made space for that numbness to be there, even for a moment?

Patient: I suspect if I actually allowed that numbness a seat at the table I’d feel unmoored—there’s this visceral fear that it’ll metastasize into immobilizing sorrow, so my brain immediately resorts to analytic scaffolding and compulsive routines to keep it at bay. Paradoxically, when I’ve briefly let it be, there’s a small de-escalation—less mental chatter, a tiny bit more breathing room—but the OCD almost reflexively offers rituals and cognitive frameworks to 'manage' it before it gets dangerous. I want to try making space, but part of me is worried that doing so means I’ll lose control at work or in relationships, and I don’t know how to hold both the vulnerability and the responsibilities without collapsing into rumination.

Therapist: The fear of losing control seems to be really driving your behavior right now. What would it be like to notice that fear showing up, not as something you need to control, but as a signal that something matters deeply to you?

Patient: That's a compelling reframe — if fear is a salience signal that something matters, it becomes an informant instead of an enemy. Intellectually I can get behind that — my brain's error-monitoring circuitry is flagging attachment loss — but in practice I still default to compulsive hierarchies and rituals to dampen the alarm because I'm terrified it will cascade into immobilizing grief. There's a small curious part that wants to name the fear as "this matters" and breathe, but then my metacognitive overlay starts theorizing about why that breathing is risky, and the whole thing becomes another problem to solve.

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is trying to make sense of that feeling of mattering, and in doing so, it's getting caught up in a cycle of analysis. What if, instead of trying to solve the problem of the breathing, you could simply notice that it's there – "this mattering feeling is showing up while I'm trying to breathe" – without needing to attach a label or a solution to it?

Patient: I can see the pragmatic utility in that — calling it "this mattering feeling is showing up" feels like a lightweight orienting device rather than another project. But my mind almost immediately converts that into a diagnostic checklist (antecedents, collapse probabilities, contingency rituals), so the simple noticing morphs into yet another cognitive task. I want to actually try a brief noticing practice, but I'm anxious it'll devolve into rumination unless we scaffold it somehow — could we try a very concrete two- or three-step practice I can use in the moment?

Therapist: Let's try a simple noticing practice that doesn't require much thinking. When you feel that mattering feeling showing up while you're trying to breathe, can you notice where your body is holding it – just the sensation of it, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I actually try to tune in, there's a dull, low pressure across my chest—like a tightened band—and a weird hollow just under my sternum, plus this muted buzz behind my eyes. Almost immediately my metacognitive overlay kicks in and turns it into a diagnostic checklist ("anxiety vs. grief vs. exhaustion?") which pulls me out of the sensation. I can try holding it for a few breaths, but can you give me a very specific two-step anchor so I don't default to theorizing?

Therapist: Those sensations sound really tangible. Here's a two-step anchor:

1. When you notice that dull band across your chest, say to yourself: "I see the band."
2. Then, without changing it, notice the next thing that happens with your body, right after you said "I see the band" – like that hollow or the buzz behind your eyes.

Patient: Okay, I tried it — I said "I see the band" and the tightness did ease a little, then that hollow and the buzz surfaced more clearly. Pretty quickly my mind started doing its diagnostic thing ("anxiety vs grief vs exhaustion") and I drifted into analysis instead of staying with the feeling. That was mildly encouraging but also frustrating — can you give me one very specific micro-anchor to use right after I notice the second sensation so I don't default into the checklist? I'm kind of anxious it'll just become another ritual unless it's really concrete.

Therapist: Let's add another small step. When you notice that hollow and the buzz, before you start analyzing, simply say to yourself: "This matters."

Patient: I tried it — saying "This matters" softened the band a bit and the hollow/buzz felt a touch clearer, but almost immediately my metacognitive apparatus re-engaged and started classifying the whole thing into diagnostic bins. It's helpful in a small way but also triggers my OCD rituals, so I keep getting pulled into analysis instead of staying with the sensation. Can we add one very small sensory anchor (like pressing my thumb and forefinger together for two breaths) right after "This matters" so I don't default into the checklist?

Therapist: Let's try adding that small sensory anchor. When you say "This matters" to yourself, right after noticing the hollow and the buzz, pause for just one moment, then press your thumb and forefinger together for a count of two, like you're giving yourself a gentle "hold" – without changing the sensation or trying to do anything with it.

Patient: I tried it — pressing my thumb and forefinger for two breaths after saying "This matters" gave a short, measurable pause where the band loosened a bit and I could feel the hollow more clearly. It honestly felt like a small reprieve, but my metacognitive checklist usually reboots after three breaths and I'm back cataloguing symptoms. I'm frustrated and a little scared it'll just calcify into another ritual unless we tweak it — could we try extending the press to three breaths or pairing it with a single grounding word to see if that lengthens the window before the analysis rushes in?

Therapist: Let's try extending the press to three breaths and pairing it with a grounding word. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for three breaths, then press your thumb and forefinger together. As you do that, notice what happens – and as you exhale, say the word "ground" to yourself, like "ground" – just to help you stay with that physical sensation and the pause. See if that helps you stay with the feeling a bit longer.

Patient: I tried it — three breaths, pressed my thumb and forefinger, said "ground" on the exhale — and there was a brief, tangible loosening of the band; the hollow and buzz came into sharper relief. Pretty fast my metacognitive engine spun up again and started cataloguing and classifying everything, which turned the whole thing into another ritual. I'm frustrated and a bit scared it'll calcify into yet another compulsion—could we try doing it together right now with you counting, and maybe add a second tactile anchor (like both feet flat and a gentle heel press) to see if that lengthens the window?

Therapist: Let's try it together. I'll count with you. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for three breaths, then press your thumb and forefinger together. As you do that, notice what happens, and as you exhale, say the word "ground" to yourself. At the same time, notice what's happening in your body with both feet – are they relaxed, or is there tension? Try to notice that tension, too, and gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor. Let's count together: 1... 2... 3...

Patient: Okay — that actually helped a bit. The band loosened, the hollow and the buzz came into sharper relief, and pressing my thumb and heel made a tangible grounding spot so I wasn't just floating in thought. Predictably, after about four breaths my metacognitive overlay booted up and turned it into a diagnostic checklist again, which was frustrating and a little scary because I'm worried it just becomes another ritual. Can we do another round with slower counts and alternate heel presses, and could you keep counting for me? I feel like the external pacing helps me stay with it instead of spiraling into analysis.

Therapist: Let's try another round. I'll keep counting for you. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 4... 5... 6... 7... breaths, then press your thumb and heel together. As you do that, notice what happens with the band, the hollow, and the buzz. Try to stay with those sensations, and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor – notice the weight, the pressure, and the slight release. Let's keep counting: 8... 9... 10...

Patient: I tried following your count and pressing thumb and heel — for a moment the band loosened and the hollow/buzz came forward. Then something grabbed my attention and my breathing went shallow; my metacognitive engine immediately pivoted into theory-mode, cataloguing contingencies instead of staying present, which makes me feel jittery and scattered. Could we do a very slow guided count now — like you pacing 1...2...3...4 with a pause between each — and alternate heel presses on each exhale? I really need that external rhythm because my internal checklist keeps hijacking the pause.

Therapist: Let's try it again, very slowly. I'll pace the count with a pause between each number. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... (pause) 11... (pause) 12...

Patient: I tried following your slow count with the alternating heel presses — at first the band loosened and the hollow/buzz came forward, but then I suddenly felt jittery and my breath shortened as my metacognitive overlay pivoted into contingency-planning (all the "what if I freeze at work" narratives). It felt like an attentional saccade: the pause collapsed into checklist-mode and the exercise dissolved into another ritual, which just makes me more anxious and scattered. Could we keep doing very slow externally paced rounds, and would you mind verbally interrupting or cueing me when I start cataloguing (like saying "notice" or "soften") so I can practice reorienting without turning it into analysis?

Therapist: Let's keep trying, very slowly. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... (pause) 11... (pause) 12...

Notice when you start to feel that attentional saccade, and your mind starts cataloguing what might happen if you freeze at work...

Patient: Yeah — I noticed it: my attention atomized and my brain immediately pivoted into contingency-mode, iterating through "what if I freeze at work" scenarios. When that happens there's a hot tightening in my chest and face and this embarrassed, want-to-hide shame that just fuels more analysis instead of letting anything land. Can you cue me with "notice" or "soften" when you hear me start cataloguing, and can we do one slow externally-paced round now so I can practice reorienting without spiraling?

Therapist: Let's try it now. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... (pause) 11... (pause) 12...

As you start to feel that "what if I freeze at work" thought, notice it for me: *soften*

Patient: Softening actually cut the reflexive checklist a bit — I noticed the "what if I freeze" thought and there’s this hot tightening in my chest and a flush of shame that makes me want to hide and start rationalizing. I'm jittery and scattered right now, and part of me already wants to turn this into another procedural fix, but I want to try sitting with the discomfort if you keep cueing me with "soften" or "notice" during another slow round.

Therapist: Let's try it again, slowly. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... (pause) 11... (pause) 12...

Notice that tightening in your chest, that flush of shame... *soften*

Patient: Softening actually helped — it cut the reflexive checklist enough that I felt the band and the hollow more, but then this hot flush of shame about some past screw-up grabbed me and my breath got shallow and jittery, and my brain immediately started profiling the feeling into error states and contingency plans. I'm annoyed and a little embarrassed by how fast I default to analysis instead of staying with the sensation. Can we do another very slow externally paced round now, and could you call out "notice" or "soften" and verbally interrupt whenever I start cataloguing so I can practice reorienting without turning it into another ritual?

Therapist: Let's try it again, slowly. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... (pause) 11... (pause) 12...

Notice the flush of shame in your chest, the way it's making your breath shallow... *soften*

Patient: Softening did help — it sliced through the checklist enough that the band and hollow came forward, but then this hot, shamey flash about some past screw-up grabbed me and my breath went shallow and jittery. I'm embarrassed and frustrated at how fast I default into analysis and contingency-planning, and I can feel myself wanting to hide or rationalize instead of staying with the sensation. Can we do another very slow round, and can you call out "notice" or "soften" (or even just interrupt) the moment you hear me start cataloguing so I can practice reorienting without it morphing into another ritual?

Therapist: Let's try it again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... (pause) 2... (pause) 3... (pause) 4... (pause) breathe in... and as you exhale, gently press the heel of one foot down onto the floor... (pause) 5... (pause) 6... (pause) 7... (pause) 8... (pause) breathe in... and press the heel of the other foot down... (pause) 9... (pause) 10... 

Wait, you're starting to think about what you did that time...

Patient: Yeah — you caught me. I just started replaying that screw-up and there's this hot, embarrassed shame that flushes my chest and makes my breath jumpy, and my brain instantly pivots into a defensive mode of contingency-mapping and rationalization. It's frustrating and humiliating because I want to actually sit with it, but instead I end up constructing elaborate analyses to keep from feeling the shame. Can you keep interrupting with a calm "notice" or "soften" and keep the slow counting so I can practice reorienting when this happens?

Therapist: When you notice that replaying the screw-up is making you feel the flush and the jumpy breath... *soften* 

Let's pause for 1...

Patient: I did soften for that pause — the band relaxed a hair and the hollow edged forward, but then a hot flush of shame hit and my breath got really shallow and jittery. My brain immediately went into contingency-mode and started narrating the replay, which makes me feel embarrassed and kind of frantic. Can you keep interrupting with a calm "soften" or "notice" and slow the counting even more? I want to try another round but I need you to cue me the moment I start cataloguing so I don't hijack the pause.

Therapist: Let's try again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice what happens when you start replaying the screw-up, before you start thinking about what you could do differently...

Patient: When I pause, the replay surges — my chest heats, my breath fragments, and this hot shame floods in so fast I want to disappear. I can narrate it as a ruminative feedback loop or a self-critical schema (which I do, reflexively), but honestly it just feels humiliating and makes me frantic. Can you cue me with a calm "soften" the moment you hear the checklist start, and lead one very slow round with you interrupting so I can practice staying with the sensation instead of converting it into another procedure?

Therapist: Let's start again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice that heat in your chest, the way it makes your breath feel... *soften*

Patient: Softening actually cut through a little — I felt that hot shame flare in my chest and my breath fragment, and then my brain immediately began constructing defensive narratives about that screw-up so I wouldn't have to sit in the embarrassment. It’s annoying and humiliating how fast I default to analysis (my usual metacognitive armor), and now I’m jittery and scattered. Can we do another very slow externally paced round right now, and please call out “notice” or “soften” the instant you hear me start cataloguing so I can practice reorienting instead of turning it into another procedure?

Therapist: Let's try it. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice what's happening right now, without trying to change it... *soften*

Patient: Softening did cut through a bit — the heat in my chest flared, my breath got shallow and jumpy, and that embarrassed, want-to-hide shame rushed in so fast I started narrativizing an old screw-up. I can feel myself slipping into theory-mode to avoid the rawness, which is maddening and makes me more frantic. Can we do another very slow round right now, and could you call out "notice" the instant you hear me start cataloguing so I can try actually staying with it?

Therapist: Let's start again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice what's happening when you start thinking about what you could have done differently... *notice*

Patient: When that "could've done differently" loop starts, my chest heats up and my breath fragments, and then I instantly slide into a post-mortem, corrective mode—rationalizing to avoid the shame, which just makes me more frantic and scattered. I keep wanting to intellectualize it instead of staying with the feeling, and that frustrates me; can you call out "notice" the moment you hear me pivot into analysis and keep the very slow counting (with pauses) so I can practice reorienting? I feel jittery and embarrassed about how fast I do this, but I want to try another round with your cues.

Therapist: Let's try it. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice when you start thinking "I could've done differently"... *notice*

Patient: I noticed it immediately — the "I could've done differently" loop jerks my attention, my chest heats, breath fragments, and a shamey humiliation surges that makes me want to hide and rationalize. My default response is to deploy a post‑mortem narrative and corrective schemas instead of actually staying with the sensation, which just makes me more jittery and scattered. Can you call out "notice" the instant you hear that pivot and do one very slow paced round with pauses so I can practice reorienting without turning it into another procedure?

Therapist: Let's start again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice when you start thinking "I could've done differently" and your chest heats up... *notice*

Patient: I notice it immediately — the “I could’ve done differently” loop makes my chest heat up, my breath fragment, and a shamey humiliation wash over me that makes me want to disappear into rationalization. I’m more anxious and distractible than usual right now, which makes it harder to stay with the sensation instead of narrativizing it. Can you call out “notice” the instant you hear me pivot and lead one very slow round with pauses so I can practice reorienting?

Therapist: Let's try it. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice the shamey feeling that's showing up in your chest, even before you start thinking about what you "could've done differently"... *notice*

Patient: I notice it — a hot, shamey pressure in my chest that makes my breath shallow and my thoughts skitter; it's embarrassingly acute, like I want to crawl out of myself and start rationalizing to avoid the humiliation. I'm jittery and distracted right now, and before I can even label it as a memory‑loop my brain's already drafting contingency plans to fix it, which just fuels the shame. Can you call out "notice" or "soften" the moment you hear me start cataloguing and lead one very slow round with pauses so I can try staying with this without turning it into another procedure?

Therapist: Let's start again. When you say "This matters" to yourself, pause for 1... *pause* 

Notice the shamey feeling in your chest right now, without trying to change it... *soften*

Patient: Softening did cut through for a second — I felt a hot constriction in my chest and my breath fragment into these sharp little gasps — but then my metacognitive narrative immediately reified it into a catastrophic schema and I started rationalizing to avoid the humiliation. It's embarrassing and infuriating how fast I pivot into analysis; I'm jittery and scattered and want to hide instead of actually sitting with the shame. Can we do another very slow externally‑paced round now, and could you call out "notice" or "soften" the instant you hear me start narrativizing so I can practice reorienting?
