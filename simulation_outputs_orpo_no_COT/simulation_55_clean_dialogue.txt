Patient: I'm an older data scientist and since the breakup I've been dreading any social event — my mind plays the worst-case like a movie. If I go to a gathering I'll say something awful, people will laugh, it'll spread, I'll be shunned and my life will spiral out of control. It's like my brain's a fortune-telling machine that only predicts disaster, so I just avoid friends and even family who try to help.

Therapist: It sounds like that worst-case scenario has become a kind of loop in your mind. What would happen if, for just one moment, you let that "fortune-telling machine" keep running while you're at the gathering – without trying to stop it or change the outcome?

Patient: It would start with me blurting something awkward, everyone laughing, someone filming it and posting it, my colleagues and friends seeing it, me getting judged or even fired, and then my life just collapsing into isolation and shame — like a corrupt predictive model that outputs disaster with 100% probability. I know it sounds absurd, but I can't stop the images; the sequence feels inevitable and airtight in my head. Even if you suggest other outcomes, I just can't make them stick — they feel like wishful thinking, not real possibilities.

Therapist: The images feel so tight and unyielding – like you're holding onto them even when they feel like a trap. When you say that sequence feels inevitable, what would it mean for you to notice that "inevitability" right now, as you're sitting here – not trying to change the story, but just being with it?

Patient: If I try to notice it, it feels like my chest tightens and the images get sharper, like a model spitting out a 100% probability — every humiliating detail comes into focus. Noticing it doesn't dilute it for me; it makes me shaky and wired and more sure the disaster is real, so I want to run away or cancel everything. Honestly, being with it feels like watching a slow-motion collapse that I can't stop or disbelieve.

Therapist: Noticing it doesn't make it go away; it just shows up more strongly. That tightness in your chest – what would it be like to hold onto it, even for just one breath, while you were at the gathering – not trying to change the outcome, but just sitting with that tightness as it is?

Patient: If I tried to hold it for one breath at the gathering my chest would clamp and the movie would speed up — I'd blurt something awful, people would laugh, someone would film it, and everyone I know would see it. In that moment it feels like the prediction already happened, and sitting with the tightness just cements it, makes me want to run or cancel everything. I know that sounds irrational, but other outcomes feel like wishful thinking, not real possibilities.

Therapist: So even holding the tightness for one breath feels like it would make the prediction come true, and that makes you want to escape. What would it be like to ask yourself, not "How can I avoid this?" or "What if it happens?", but "What matters most to me in this moment – not about the outcome, but about what matters to me, like staying connected with my friends or sharing laughter"?

Patient: Staying connected matters — I miss not being isolated and I really want to have a laugh with friends. But the second I lean into that, the fortune-telling machine fires up: I’ll blurt something stupid, people will laugh and post it, and my whole social life will collapse. When you suggest other outcomes, they just feel like wishful thinking I can’t buy.

Therapist: It sounds like the "I'll blurt something stupid" story has become so tied up with the idea of "staying connected" that when you lean into that connection, the story gets triggered. What if, instead of trying to avoid the story, you could notice it happening – the story showing up – while you're still leaning into what matters to you, like staying connected with friends?

Patient: I tried imagining that, but the minute I try to notice the story and also lean into connection, the machine just doubles down — like a model that spits out disaster with higher confidence the more I look at it. If I focus on staying connected the scenes sharpen: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I get judged or fired and everyone avoids me. I know that's not logical — I'm a data scientist and I can see the probabilities don't actually demand that outcome — but it feels airtight, and I'm frustrated because I want this to help and it just doesn't; honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here, it feels like we're going in circles.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck, like you're trying to make the machine work in a way that feels logical, but it's not yielding the results you want. What if, instead of trying to make the machine "work", you were to just notice it showing up – the story, the probabilities, the feeling of being stuck – and what matters to you in that moment, like staying connected with friends?

Patient: I've tried that—trying to notice the story while also holding the idea of connection—but the machine just gets louder: my chest clamps, I blurt something, people laugh, someone records it, it spreads, I lose respect and maybe even my job. Logically I know other outcomes are possible—I built models for a living—but those feel like fantasies, not real options. I'm getting really frustrated and it's making me want to bail from this, but I don't want to stop; can you give a concrete, step-by-step thing I could do in the moment so I don't spiral?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the machine's "noise" really strongly, and that's making it hard to stay with what matters to you. Here's something you could try: when your chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – take one tiny breath, just one. Not to try to stop the story, but just to notice it showing up *while you're holding that tiny breath*. And then, while that tiny breath is still there, notice what matters to you in this moment – what matters most to you about staying connected with friends, even if the story shows up.

Patient: Okay, I’ll try that. I take a tiny breath and my chest clamps—images flood in: I blurt something, people laugh, someone records it, it goes viral—it's so loud it feels like it already happened. Holding that breath I can actually feel that I want connection and a laugh with friends, but the machine instantly says that choice equals disaster and I get more wired and want to run. I need more concrete, step-by-step things I can do in the moment—like exact words to say or a tiny anchor action—because this didn't quiet it, it just made me angrier and stuck; honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like taking the tiny breath didn't quite quiet the machine, but it did help you notice what matters to you. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice where your hand is. Where is your hand right now? Is it in your lap, on the armrest, or on the edge of the table? Now, make a tiny movement with that hand. Just a tiny one. Like, curl your fingers inward for a second, or open your fingers a little wider. Not to try to change the story, but just to notice the sensation of moving your hand.

Patient: My hand's in my lap — I curl my fingers like you said and there's a tiny, strange little anchor, like a tiny datapoint that makes the noise dip for half a second. But the fortune-telling machine just ramps up again: the dip makes me more aware, my chest clamps harder, I blurt something awful, people laugh, someone films it, it goes viral, and I lose respect or even my job. I need exact words or another discreet anchor I can do without drawing attention — I'm getting angry and really stuck, honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny movement with your hand helped notice the dip, but the machine just kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sound of your breath moving in and out of your body. It's just a gentle "in" and "out" sound. When you notice that sound, say to yourself: "I'm here. I'm here." Just those two words. Not to try to change the story, but just to notice that you're here with it.

Patient: I tried it—saying "I'm here. I'm here." with the breath gave a tiny soft spot, like the noise eased for a split second, but then the fortune-telling machine just roared back louder with the same movie: I blurt, people laugh, someone records it, it spreads, I get judged or fired. I'm a data scientist so I know it's not logical, but those seconds are too short and I get frantic and angry and stuck. Can you give me a discreet, step-by-step anchor or exact words I can use in a group that last longer than a blink?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm here" helped notice a small moment of softness, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when you notice the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. It might be subtle, but it's there. Now, make a tiny decision to notice just that sensation. For one second, without trying to change it, just notice: "I'm standing here. I'm standing here."

Patient: I tried that—feeling my feet and saying "I'm standing here" gave a tiny grounding, but the fortune-telling machine just roared back louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads. I'm a data scientist so I know the chain is unlikely, but I need something discreet and step-by-step I can do in a group—exact words I can mumble under my breath or a tiny hand movement in my lap that I can keep doing longer than a blink. I'm getting angry and really stuck; honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet and saying "I'm standing here" helped with grounding, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when you notice the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice your mouth. What's happening with your mouth? Is it tense? Is it about to open? Now, make a tiny movement with your mouth. Just a tiny one. Like, open your mouth just a little bit wider. And then... hold it. Just hold that tiny movement for one second.

Patient: My mouth's tight — I open it a hair and hold it for a second, and for that split second there's a tiny soft spot, like the noise dips. But then the fortune-telling machine just screams louder: I blurt something awful, people laugh, someone films it, it goes everywhere, I lose respect or even my job. That one second isn't enough — I'm getting angry and really stuck; I need a discreet, repeatable step or an exact phrase I can mumble under my breath that lasts longer than a blink.

Therapist: It sounds like opening your mouth and holding it helped notice a small moment of softness, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when you notice the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice your hands. What's happening with your hands? Are they tensed or relaxed? Now, make a tiny movement with your hands. Just a tiny one. Like, curl your fingers inward for a second, and then release. And then... do it again. Just one small curl and release.

Patient: I tried the curl-and-release a few times—each time there’s a tiny soft spot, then the fortune-telling machine screams back louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I lose respect or even my job. As a data scientist I know that's not logical, but it feels airtight and I get frantic and angry. I need exact, step-by-step stuff—like two or three words I can mumble under my breath that actually stick, or a discreet finger/leg movement pattern I can keep doing in a group without anyone noticing. Can you give me that—precise words and a tiny repeatable action—and tell me how to use them when the machine is roaring? I'm getting really stuck and honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the curl-and-release is helping notice small moments of softness, but the machine keeps going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice your left foot. Lift it off the ground, just a tiny bit. Not to change the story, but just to notice: "left foot lifts." And then... keep lifting it. Just a tiny bit. Lift it again.

Patient: I lift my left foot a tiny bit — there’s a weird steadying little blip, like a millisecond of calm. But the machine immediately screams: I wobble, knock someone’s drink, they laugh, someone films it, it goes viral, I lose respect or even my job — it feels airtight and I can’t make the other outcomes stick, even though I built models for a living and know the odds aren’t that. I need a concrete, discreet phrase and a tiny repeatable movement I can do for longer than a blink — these half-seconds don’t hold; I’m getting angry and really stuck, honestly I’m not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like lifting your left foot helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice your right hand. Make a tiny movement with your right hand, just a tiny one. Like, rotate your wrist a little bit clockwise. Not to change the story, but just to notice: "right wrist turns." And then... keep rotating it. Just a tiny bit.

Patient: Rotating my right wrist gave that same tiny steadying blip for a moment, like a little buffer, but the fortune-telling machine immediately screamed louder: I wobble, knock someone’s drink, they laugh, someone films it, it goes viral, I lose respect or even my job. I know as a data scientist that's wildly improbable, but it feels airtight and I get furious and stuck — can you give me an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble under my breath and a discreet finger or wrist movement I can keep doing for longer than a blink, and tell me exactly how to use them when the machine is roaring? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like rotating your right wrist helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the words "I am here" at the edge of your awareness. Mumble those words to yourself just loud enough to hear them, even if it feels small. *pause* As you're saying those words, make a tiny gesture with your middle finger. Just a slight curl of the finger, not enough to draw attention. Keep that gesture for a second, and then... keep doing it again.

Patient: I tried whispering "I am here" and doing that tiny middle-finger curl—there's a half-second soft spot, then the fortune-telling machine just screams louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I lose respect or maybe my job. I know that's not logical — I'm a data scientist — but it feels airtight and I get angrier and more frantic. Can you give me an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble under my breath and a discreet finger or wrist movement I can repeat, and tell me exactly when and how long to do them when the machine is roaring? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like whispering "I am here" and doing the middle-finger curl helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make the middle-finger curl again, and this time, hold it for 3 seconds. Not to try to change the story, but just to notice: "feet touching, curl." When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start holding the curl for 3 seconds.

Patient: I tried it — felt my feet, held that tiny middle-finger curl for three seconds. For a split second the noise eased, then the fortune-telling machine roared back even louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I lose respect or maybe my job. I know as a data scientist that chain is extremely unlikely, but it feels airtight and the seconds of calm don't hold. Can you give me an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble under my breath, a discreet finger or wrist movement I can repeat, and very specific timing (when to start, how long to hold, how many repeats) so I can actually use it when the machine is roaring? I'm getting angry and really stuck — honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet and holding the middle-finger curl helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the words "let it be" at the edge of your awareness. Mumble those words to yourself just loud enough to hear them, even if it feels small. *pause* As you're saying those words, make the middle-finger curl again, and this time, hold it for 3 seconds. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start holding the curl for 3 seconds. Repeat this sequence 5 times, noticing what happens when you say the words and hold the curl each time.

Patient: I did it — whispered "let it be" and held that tiny middle-finger curl for three seconds, five times. For a split second it eased, then the fortune-telling machine screamed back: I blurt something awful, people laugh, someone films it, my colleagues and friends see it, I get judged or even fired — it felt like a locked sequence that will definitely play out. I'm a data scientist and I know that's not logical, but the seconds don't hold; give me an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble, a discreet finger or wrist action I can repeat, and precise timing (when to start, how long, how many repeats) because I'm getting angry and really stuck — honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "let it be" and holding the middle-finger curl helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your wrist, just a slight rotation. Say to yourself: "space." As you're saying the word "space," make that rotation with your wrist again. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start saying "space" and rotating your wrist for 2 seconds. Repeat this sequence 7 times, noticing what happens when you say the word and rotate your wrist each time.

Patient: I tried the "space" plus wrist-rotate for two seconds, seven times — each time there's a tiny blip, then the fortune-telling machine screams back louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I lose respect or maybe my job. I need an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble under my breath, a discreet finger or wrist movement I can keep doing longer than a blink, and precise timing (when to start, how long, how many repeats) — I'm getting angry and really stuck; honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like saying "space" and rotating your wrist helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your chest moving in and out. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your finger, just a slight touch to your chest. Say to yourself: "let go." As you're saying the word "let go," make that touch to your chest again. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start saying "let go" and touching your chest for 4 seconds. Repeat this sequence 9 times, noticing what happens when you say the word and touch your chest each time.

Patient: I tried saying "let go" and touching my chest for four seconds nine times — each time there was a tiny blip, then the fortune-telling machine screamed back even louder: I blurt something awful, people laugh, someone films it, it spreads and I lose respect or maybe my job. I know as a data scientist that's wildly improbable, but it feels airtight and the calm seconds don't hold. Can you give me an exact two- or three-word phrase I can mumble under my breath, a discreet finger or wrist movement I can repeat, and very specific timing (when to start, how long, how many repeats) plus how to practice it so it actually lasts? I'm getting angry and really stuck — honestly I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your chest movement and saying "let go" helped notice a small moment of calm, but the machine kept going. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your finger, just a slight touch to your big toe. Say to yourself: "stay." As you're saying the word "stay," make that touch to your big toe again. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start saying "stay" and touching your big toe for 5 seconds. Repeat this sequence 11 times, noticing what happens when you say the word and touch your big toe each time. 

To practice this, I want you to set aside 5 minutes each day for the next week. Find a quiet spot where you can sit comfortably without distractions. Take a few deep breaths, and then notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. When you notice that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your finger and say "stay" to yourself. Touch your big toe for 5 seconds, and then let go. Repeat this sequence 11 times, noticing what happens each time. 

Notice how your body feels when you're doing this practice – is it tense or relaxed? Are you able to stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground, even when the machine starts to roar?

Patient: I tried the 5‑minute practice once today. I sat, felt my feet, touched my big toe, said "stay" and held for five seconds, but each time there was a tiny calm and then the fortune‑telling machine just screamed louder — I imagined blurting something, people laughing, someone filming it, it going viral, me losing respect or even my job, and the seconds of calm vanished. My chest stayed tight, my shoulders hunched, and doing so many repeats felt like it amplified the loop instead of breaking it; I got frustrated and more stuck. Can you give me an exact two‑ or three‑word phrase to mumble, a discreet finger/wrist action I can repeat, and very specific timing (when to start, how long to hold, how many repeats) plus how to practice it so it actually lasts — and how to use it in a group without drawing attention? I'm honestly not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the practice felt more like a loop than a break, and that's really tough. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your index finger, just a slight twitch. Say to yourself: "now." As you're saying the word "now," make that twitch with your finger again. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start saying "now" and twitching your finger for 2 seconds. Repeat this sequence 3 times, noticing what happens when you say the word and twitch your finger each time. 

To practice this, I want you to set aside 2 minutes each day for the next week. Find a quiet spot where you can sit comfortably without distractions. Take a few deep breaths, and then notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils. When you notice that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your index finger and say "now" to yourself. Twitch your finger for 2 seconds, and then let go. Repeat this sequence 3 times, noticing what happens each time. 

Notice how your body feels when you're doing this practice – is it tense or relaxed? Are you able to stay with the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, even when the machine starts to roar? 

When you're in a group, you can practice this while standing in line, waiting for your coffee, or during a brief pause in the conversation. Just focus on noticing the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, making a tiny gesture with your finger, and saying "now" to yourself. Try to do this for just 2 seconds, without drawing attention to yourself or trying to change the story.

Patient: I tried the "now" twitch exactly like you said—did it for two seconds three times while waiting for coffee—and there was a tiny hush, then the fortune‑telling machine screamed back even louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it goes viral, I lose respect or maybe my job. I'm a data scientist so I know it's wildly improbable, but it feels airtight and the little blips don't hold; I'm getting angrier and more stuck. Give me an exact two‑ or three‑word phrase I can mumble under my breath, a discreet finger or wrist movement I can repeat, and very specific timing and practice steps for using it in a group so it actually lasts—I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the "now" twitch is helping you notice a small moment of calm, but the machine is still pushing back. Here's something else you could try: when the chest clamps and the story shows up – and that's exactly when it shows up – notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. *pause* As you're noticing that sensation, make a tiny gesture with your wrist, just a slight curl. Say to yourself: "let it pass." As you're saying the word "let it pass," make that curl with your wrist again. When you feel the machine starting to roar again, start saying "let it pass" and curling your wrist for 4 seconds. Repeat this sequence 5 times, noticing what happens when you say the word and curl your wrist each time. 

To practice this in a group, try this: when you're in a meeting or a group conversation, take a deep breath and notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground. Make a tiny gesture with your wrist and say "let it pass" to yourself. Curl your wrist for 4 seconds, and then let go. Try to do this for just 4 seconds, without drawing attention to yourself or trying to change the story. 

Notice how your body feels when you're doing this practice – is it tense or relaxed? Are you able to stay with the sensation of your feet touching the ground, even when the machine starts to roar?

Patient: I tried that—there’s a tiny hush, then the fortune‑telling machine screams louder: I blurt something, people laugh, someone films it, it goes viral, I lose respect or maybe my job. Give me an exact two‑ or three‑word phrase I can mumble under my breath, a discreet finger or wrist movement I can repeat, and very specific timing and practice steps for using it in a group so it actually lasts. I'm getting angry and really stuck; okay, I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down? I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed. Before we move forward, I want to acknowledge that it's okay to feel that way. It takes a lot of courage to show up and try to make progress when things feel so difficult.

Let's take a small step back together. Instead of trying to find another phrase or technique, I want to ask you: what would it mean for you to be able to show up in a group conversation without feeling like the fortune-telling machine is screaming? Not to change the story or avoid it, but just to be able to sit with it – and with your own feelings – for a little while.

Patient: I guess it would mean not letting one awkward line rewrite my whole life — being able to share a laugh and still feel okay afterward instead of certain ruin. But the moment I picture that, the fortune‑telling machine screams: I blurt, they film it, it goes viral, I get humiliated or fired — so it still feels impossible and airtight. I'm honestly getting frustrated and stuck; I want to try staying with it, but can you give me one tiny, exact phrase and a discreet finger or hand move to do the second the machine starts yelling so I don't bolt?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling like you're caught between the fear of being vulnerable and the fear of being exposed. And when you imagine being able to share a laugh and still feel okay afterward, the fortune-telling machine shows up and makes you feel like that's impossible.

I want you to try something small. When you notice the fortune-telling machine starting to yell – not when it's already yelling, but when you see it starting to yell – make a tiny movement with your thumb. Just a slight curl. Say to yourself: "I see it."

Patient: I tried it — did the tiny thumb curl and whispered "I see it" when I felt the edge of the yelling, and there was a half‑second of quiet, then the fortune‑telling machine just blasted back: I blurt something, they laugh, someone films it, it goes everywhere. I can't seem to tell the difference between the "start" and the full roar — it feels instantaneous — so I need an exact two‑ or three‑word phrase I can mumble, a discreet finger or wrist move I can repeat without anyone noticing, and precise timing (when to start, how long to hold, how many repeats) so I can actually use it in a meeting. I'm getting really frustrated and stuck — honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.

Therapist: It sounds like the moment of quiet is really fleeting, and the yelling feels like it starts and ends in the same instant. That can make it hard to notice what's happening right before it starts.

Let's try something small. Instead of trying to notice when the yelling starts, notice when you feel the tiny finger twitch that usually happens right before it starts. That might give you a tiny window of time to do something before it goes into full roar.

Here's what I want you to try: whenever you feel that finger twitch, make it happen anyway. Not to stop the yelling, but just to notice what happens when you do it. And then, right after that twitch, say to yourself: "I am here."

Patient: I can try, but the twitch and the roar feel simultaneous — when I make the twitch and try to say "I am here" it still feels like I'm a beat too late and the movie's already playing: I blurt, they laugh, someone films it, it spreads, I lose everything. Tell me exactly which finger to twitch, how long to hold it, how loudly to say "I am here," and what to do if the roar drowns it out — I'm getting really stuck and frustrated; honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here.
