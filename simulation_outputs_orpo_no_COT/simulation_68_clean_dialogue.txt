Patient: Lately I've been feeling really stuck and directionless — like I only know myself as a software developer and I don't know what matters to me beyond that. I'm still carrying grief from a recent breakup and it’s left me kind of numb and unsure how to move forward. To be honest, I'm skeptical this will help; I've tried talking before and it mostly felt pointless.

Therapist: When you say "I'm skeptical this will help," what might be holding that skepticism for you?

Patient: Mostly it's that I've done this before and it felt like talking in circles — nothing really changed afterward. I'm practical and want concrete ways to move forward, not just sit with feelings, and I worry this will be more of the same. Honestly, I'm guarded about opening up because it hasn't led to anything better, so how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: That sense of being guarded—like you're protecting yourself from what might happen if you let your guard down—feels really heavy. When you say "I want concrete ways to move forward," what would it mean for you to actually take a step toward that, even if it feels scary or uncertain?

Patient: I guess it would mean actually scheduling small, low-stakes experiments — like an hour a week to try something that's not coding (a class, a meetup, or just coffee with one person) — something concrete I can track so it's not just feelings. But honestly, I've done "try new things" before and either lost interest or felt numb, so how is that supposed to help when I don't even know if I care? I could try something tiny to test it, but I'm guarded about committing because I don't trust it'll change anything.

Therapist: You're looking for a way to test whether that small experiment might actually matter to you, without committing to it fully. What if, instead of "I don't know if I care," you noticed what happens when you say "I'm curious to see if I care about this, and it might not matter either way"?

Patient: Okay — I can try shifting to "I'm curious" instead of "I don't know if I care" because that sounds less like a verdict. But how is that supposed to help? Even "curious" can feel numb and performative for me, like I won't follow through. I could try one tiny, low-stakes thing this week as an experiment, but I'm guarded about committing — can we make it something really small I won't bail on?

Therapist: Let's try to make it even smaller than that. What if, instead of "I'll try an hour a week," you just notice the thought "I should try something new this week" when it comes up for you? Not to make a decision, just to notice it—like taking a tiny pause between the thought and doing something else.

Patient: Okay — I can try just noticing the thought when it comes up instead of deciding anything. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? It usually just feels like deferring, and when I'm numb it comes off as performative — I'm still guarded about opening up. I'll try to notice it three times this week and jot a quick one-line note in my phone when it happens, but what exactly should I be paying attention to when I "notice" it?

Therapist: When you say "it usually just feels like deferring," what happens when you notice that thought showing up—like, what's the sensation of it "coming up" for you?

Patient: It usually starts as a dull tightness in my chest, like a little ping in the back of my head, and my attention narrows — I either push the thought away or start running a quick internal checklist of why it’s pointless. My shoulders tense, my breathing gets shallower, and I feel this urge to distract myself with code or scrolling. But honestly, how is just noting that supposed to change anything when I end up doing the same thing every time?

Therapist: Those sensations and urges make sense. When you notice that tightness and the urge to distract yourself, what's one tiny thing you could do with your attention right there, even if it feels small or insignificant, without trying to change the tightness or the urge?

Patient: I could try something really tiny like taking one slow, full exhale and letting my attention sit on that single breath, or naming one thing I can hear in the room — maybe rest my hand on my chest for a moment and just notice the feeling. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when I'm usually still stuck after these little tricks? I'll try doing the single-exhale thing the next three times the tightness shows up and jot a one-line note, but I'm guarded about whether it'll actually change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if this tiny experiment will make a difference in the end, like you're trying to prove its value. What if, instead of waiting to see if it makes a difference, you just allowed yourself to do that small action—like taking that slow exhale—when the tightness shows up next time? Not to change the tightness, but just to notice what happens when you do that small thing, even if it feels like it might not matter in the big picture.

Patient: Alright — I can try letting myself do that slow exhale next time the tightness shows up, just to notice it and not try to fix anything. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I often do small things and still end up numb or distracted, so I'm skeptical it'll make a dent. I'll try it three times and jot one line about what I noticed — should I focus the note on body sensations, thoughts, or what I did afterward? I'm guarded about committing but I can try.

Therapist: Noticing what happens afterward might actually be harder to focus on when you're trying to change something. What if, instead of focusing on what you did afterward, you just noticed what happened right there when you let the tightness show up, even for just a moment?

Patient: Alright — I can try that. I'll just notice for a few seconds whether the tightness shifts at all, whether my breathing changes, and what the first thought is, then jot a one-line note like "tightness unchanged, breath shallow, thought = pointless." But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'm guarded about whether this will actually move the needle — and can you clarify how long "just a moment" should be?

Therapist: You're asking what it's for. Notice that "it's supposed to help" is showing up again. What if, for just 1 second, you let that thought "it's supposed to help" be exactly what it is, without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try holding that thought for one second without trying to fix it — next time the tightness shows up I'll let "it's supposed to help" be exactly that for a beat. But honestly, how is one second supposed to help? I'll do it three times and jot a one-line note like "thought held 1s; tightness unchanged" — does that sound like the right thing to notice?

Therapist: Noticing that "thought held 1s; tightness unchanged" seems like a good fit. What if, instead of focusing on whether it "sounds like the right thing" to notice, you just allowed yourself to notice that thought—without trying to use it to change anything—when the tightness shows up next time?

Patient: Alright — I can try that. Next time the tightness shows up I'll let the thought "it's supposed to help" be exactly that for a beat and then jot a quick line like "thought held 1s; tightness unchanged." But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'm worried it'll just become another thing to forget or another box to check, and that pressure will make me bail.

Therapist: That feeling of pressure is showing up again. What if, instead of trying to figure out how it "should help," you just noticed that feeling right there—like a tiny weight in your chest—when you thought "I'm worried it'll just become another thing to forget or another box to check"?

Patient: Yeah... I notice that tiny weight — my chest tightens, my shoulders drop, and everything feels a bit muted, like I just want to scroll and shut it down. I can try noticing it without doing anything else next time, but seriously, how is that supposed to help when it just feels like another task I'll forget? I'll do the one-second hold three times and jot the note, though I'm not convinced it'll change much.

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny weight is already showing up when you think about "just noticing it." What if, instead of asking "how is this supposed to help," you noticed what would happen to that weight if you didn't try to push it away or forget it—just for a moment?

Patient: Yeah... when I don't push it away the weight just sits there — kind of blunted at the edges, my breath slows a bit, and thoughts go flat. It doesn't feel like it fixes anything, but I can let it be like that for a few breaths. Still—how is that supposed to help? I'm tempted to bail, but I'll try it.

Therapist: You're noticing what happens when you don't push it away. That's not about fixing it; it's about what's already showing up when you try to change it. What if, instead of trying to "make it matter," you just let that flat feeling be there, not to fix anything, but just to notice it while you breathe?

Patient: Okay... I can try that for a few breaths. When I let the flatness sit, there's this stupid sting of shame and frustration that makes me want to disappear and grab my phone. I'll do it three times and jot a one-line note, but honestly—how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The shame and frustration are showing up. What if, instead of trying to push them away, you noticed them right there—like a dark cloud in the corner of the room—while you breathe? Not to change them, but just to see what happens if you don't try to make them go away.

Patient: Yeah... when I try to notice it it tightens—this stupid sting of shame and frustration—and my first impulse is to vanish into my phone. I can try sitting with it for a few breaths, letting it be like a dark shape in the corner, but I'm not sure I follow how just watching it actually changes anything. I'll do it once now and jot a one-line note, though I'm skeptical it'll move the needle.

Therapist: The tightness of shame and frustration is showing up again. What if, instead of asking "how does it change anything," you noticed what would happen to that tightness if you didn't try to change it, just for a moment?

Patient: Okay... I let it sit for a moment. The tightness stays low in my chest, my breath gets flatter, and that stupid sting of shame flickers — makes me want to disappear into my phone. But seriously, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The tightness is still there, but it's not pushing you to do anything. What if, instead of trying to make it go away, you noticed that "stupid sting of shame" right there, not as a problem to be solved, but just as a tiny, flickering thing in the corner of the room?

Patient: Yeah... I can try that — just notice the sting as a tiny flicker in the corner instead of trying to fix it. When I do, the shame spikes and I want to disappear into my phone, and honestly I'm not sure I follow how watching it changes anything. I'll try holding it for a breath next time and jot a quick line, but I'm guarded about whether it'll do anything.

Therapist: The shame spikes again. What if, instead of asking "how does it change anything," you noticed what happens when you *don't* try to change it?

Patient: Okay... I tried not changing it and the tightness just sat there, my breath flattened and that sting of shame shot through — made me want to disappear into my phone. I can hold it for a breath and jot "tightness steady; shame spike; urge to escape," but honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The tightness and shame are still there. What if, instead of focusing on the words "tightness steady; shame spike; urge to escape," you noticed what's already happening while you're holding the tightness—like the feeling of your breath flattening or the sensation of your body in the chair?

Patient: Okay... when I hold the tightness I notice my breath gets really flat, my shoulders feel heavy on the chair, my hands are a bit cold and tense in my lap, and my jaw's clenched. My mind immediately calls it "pointless" and I want my phone — I'll try to notice and jot "breath flat; shoulders heavy; thought=pointless; urge=phone" once more, but seriously, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The thoughts and urges are showing up again. What if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or the urges, you just noticed them right there—like a dark cloud in the corner of the room—without trying to push them away or make sense of them?

Patient: Okay... I can try noticing them like that, letting the dark cloud sit without doing anything. When I do it usually feels hollow and makes me want to disappear into my phone, so honestly how is that supposed to help? I'll try it once and jot a quick note, though I'm guarded about whether it'll change anything.

Therapist: The feeling of hollow-ness is showing up again. What if, instead of asking "how does it help," you noticed what would happen to that feeling if you didn't try to fill it with anything—the phone, thoughts, or anything else—for just a moment?

Patient: Okay... I can try leaving it empty for a moment. When I do that my chest goes hollow, the urge to grab my phone kicks in, and that stupid sting of shame flares up — I'm not convinced this will help. I'll hold it for three breaths and jot "hollow held 3; urge=phone; shame spike," but honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The shame spike is showing up again. What if, instead of trying to change it, you noticed the shame right there—like a small flame in the corner of the room—while you held the hollow feeling? Not to make it go away, but just to see what happens when you notice it without trying to fix it.

Patient: Yeah... I can try noticing the shame like that while holding the hollow. When I do it the little flame just flares—my chest tightens, my jaw clinches, and I want to disappear into my phone. I'll do it once and jot "shame noticed; hollow held 3; urge=phone," but honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: The flame of shame is still there. What if, instead of trying to notice it or hold it, you simply allowed it to be there—the small, flickering flame—in the space where the hollow feeling is, without trying to push it away or make sense of it?

Patient: I can try letting the flame just be in that hollow spot, but when I do it the shame just flares and I feel useless — chest tight, jaw clenched, and this pull to disappear into my phone. I don't see how "allowing" it isn't just another way of giving up, so how is that supposed to help? I'll try it once and jot a note, but I'm pretty guarded and not convinced this will change anything.

Therapist: The feeling of giving up is showing up again. What if, instead of asking "how does that help," you noticed what would happen to that feeling if you *kept* holding the flame of shame in the hollow spot—without trying to change it, or push it away, or give up—just for one moment?

Patient: Alright... I'll try holding it for one moment. When I do the shame heats up — chest tight, breath shallow, voice in my head says I'm useless, and I want to disappear into my phone — so honestly, how is that supposed to help? I'll hold it for one breath and jot "shame flare; hollow held; urge=phone" — what should I notice next after that?

Therapist: The shame flare is still there. What if, instead of noticing it or trying to change it, you simply *saw* the thought "I'm useless"—the word, the phrase, the sentence—while holding the shame, without trying to make it true?

Patient: Okay... I can try that. I hold the shame and just look at the words "I'm useless" — it feels huge, my chest clamps, that old failure flashes and I want to disappear into my phone. How is simply seeing the sentence supposed to stop it from feeling true? I'll do it once and jot "saw 'I'm useless'; shame spike; urge=phone" — what should I notice next?

Therapist: The sentence is still there. What if, instead of trying to stop the shame or the failure from feeling true, you noticed what would happen to that feeling if you *talked* to it—the sentence—"I'm useless"—while holding the shame, without trying to change it?

Patient: Talk to it? How is that supposed to help? Still—I can try saying something small to the sentence, like "I hear you, but that's not the whole story" or "thanks for trying to protect me," even though it feels awkward and the shame spikes and I want my phone. I'll try it once and jot "said to thought; shame spike; urge=phone"—but honestly, I'm not convinced this'll change much.
