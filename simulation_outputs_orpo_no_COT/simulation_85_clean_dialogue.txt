Patient: I'm a teacher in my early sixties and lately I keep snapping at my kids with this empty-nest thing — and the second I get irritated I just know it's going to blow up. I'll say something small, they'll get defensive, they'll stop talking to me, that'll make me spiral, I'll mess up at work from being distracted, get in trouble, and end up isolated and ruined. I know it sounds extreme, but I can't shake the feeling that that's definitely what's going to happen.

Therapist: It sounds like when you feel that empty-nest thing rising up, you're already imagining the worst-case scenario – your kids stopping talking to you, and that making you feel like you're failing. And then you're stuck in this cycle of snapping, which seems to get a reaction from them. 

What would happen if, for just a moment, you could notice that "I'm about to snap" feeling, without trying to stop it or change it? Not because you want to be mean, but just so you can see what's really at play here – what matters most to you when you're feeling that emptiness.

Patient: If I try to notice it, I just get this tight panic and the whole disaster movie plays out — I'll snap, they’ll shut me out, I’ll spiral, mess up at work, and end up alone and useless; it feels like it's already happening. What matters most in that moment is not being abandoned, like connection is everything and I can’t bear losing it. I know you want me to consider other outcomes, but honestly those feel like wishful thinking — I can't make myself believe anything but the disaster story.

Therapist: It sounds like the panic and the disaster story are really connected to the fear of losing connection with your kids. When you notice that tightness and the "disaster movie" shows up, it's like your heart is saying, "No, no, no, I have to keep them safe, I have to keep the connection." 

Can you imagine what it might be like to hold that tightness in your body, while also trying one tiny thing – just one small step – towards connection with your kids, even when you're feeling that panic? Not to make the panic go away, but just to see what might happen if you took that step anyway.

Patient: I can picture holding the tightness and doing one tiny thing—like texting a short, calm, "Can we talk?"—but the minute I do I see it going sideways. They'll take it as an accusation, get defensive, I'll blurt something worse in panic, they'll shut down, and then all the disaster stuff I fear will happen and I'll be left even more isolated. Honestly, I'm overwhelmed just imagining trying it; it feels like setting a trap that proves my worst fear right.

Therapist: It sounds like the worry about setting a trap and making things worse is really weighing on you. That's understandable – when we imagine our worst-case scenario, it can feel like it's pulling us in. 

Notice what's happening when you imagine that scenario: what's your body doing? Where's that tightness in your chest when you picture the argument and the isolation? Is it the same tightness you feel when you're trying to notice it now?

Patient: It's this tight, heavy knot that starts in my gut and shoots up to my chest and throat — my breath gets shallow, my hands clench, my jaw locks, and my head goes fuzzy. It's exactly the same tightness I feel when I try to notice it, only louder, like the fortune-telling machine turns the volume up. When that happens I can feel my mouth ready to snap and I start imagining the whole train wreck, and honestly I'm getting overwhelmed just saying it — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like when that tightness shows up, you're already in the midst of the panic – not noticing it, but feeling it all the way down to your breath. That makes sense. 

Can we pause for just a moment, and when you're ready, take a tiny breath in – just for a second – and say "I see that tightness" with me? Not because you want to make it go away, but just because it's what's showing up when you notice it.

Patient: Okay… I take a tiny breath — "I see that tightness" — but the second I say it the panic ramps up and the fortune-telling machine starts yelling that I'll snap, they'll shut me out, and everything goes downhill. I'm getting overwhelmed just saying that; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like when you say "I see that tightness," your mind is already trying to fix it – like "oh no, this is bad, I need to stop it." But instead of trying to fix it, what if we just noticed it again, without trying to change it? Not because you want to make the panic go away, but because it's what's showing up when you notice it.

Patient: I try to just notice it—“I see the tightness”—and my breath goes shallow, my jaw locks, and the fortune-teller immediately starts yelling the worst: I’ll snap, they’ll shut me out, I’ll ruin everything. Even when I tell myself not to fix it, noticing seems to crank the disaster volume up instead of calming it. I’m getting overwhelmed by that loop—can we slow down a bit? I don’t know how to stay with it without spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness is actually making the panic show up even more – not what you were hoping for. That's okay. When you notice that happening, what happens if you could just let the noticing be there, without trying to stop it or fix it? Not because you want to make the panic go away, but just because it's what's showing up – like a small rock in the river, without trying to push it away.

Patient: I try to let the noticing be like that rock, but the minute I do the fortune-telling machine cranks up — my chest tightens, breathing gets shallow, and the whole train-wreck story gets louder: I’ll snap, they’ll shut me out, everything falls apart. I can’t seem to stay with it without spiraling; I’m really overwhelmed right now — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling to stay with the noticing, and that's understandable. When you say you're overwhelmed, I want you to know that I'm here with you, not trying to fix it. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the tightness or the panic, you could just be with the feeling of being overwhelmed? Not because you want to change it, but because that's what's showing up right now.

Patient: I try to sit with the overwhelmed feeling, but it just flips the fortune-teller on full blast — it feels like proof I'm failing and that they'll pull away for good, and that thought makes my chest tighten more. Being with it doesn't calm anything; it just fuels the train-wreck story and I start panicking about every possible fallout. I'm honestly getting really overwhelmed — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like being with the overwhelmed feeling actually makes the panic show up even more – not what you were hoping for. That's okay. When you say it feels like proof you're failing, what if that thought wasn't actually true? Not because you want to make it true, but because it might be what's showing up when you're feeling that way.

Patient: I wish I could, but my head's already filming the whole disaster — one small comment, they get defensive, they stop talking, I start screwing up at work, everyone thinks I'm a mess, and I'm left alone. Telling myself it might not be true feels like lying; I can't make myself believe any outcome other than the worst. My chest tightens and my hands clench just thinking about it — I'm getting really overwhelmed, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the worst-case scenario is already playing out in your mind, and it feels like you can't let yourself imagine anything else. When you say you can't make yourself believe any outcome other than the worst, what if it's okay to hold that thought for just a moment, even if it feels like it's not true?

Patient: Maybe I could try to hold that thought for a moment, but the second I do the fortune-telling machine screams: I’ll blurt something, they’ll cut me off, they’ll stop calling, I’ll mess up at school from being distracted, people will think I’m a wreck and I’ll end up alone. It feels like holding it just turns the volume up on the disaster instead of helping, and I’m getting really overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like holding that thought for a moment actually makes the worst-case scenario show up even more – like the volume turned up even louder. When you say it feels like holding it just turns the volume up, what if that's exactly what's happening?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is that supposed to help? If holding it just cranks the fortune-teller louder, it feels like you're telling me to stare at the thing that makes the train wreck start—I'll snap, they'll shut me out, I'll mess up at work, and end up alone. I'm confused and really overwhelmed by that idea; can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and stuck. When you say "I'm not sure I follow" and "it feels like you're telling me to stare at the thing," I want you to know that I'm not trying to tell you to do that. 

Can I try to ask it in a different way? What if, instead of trying to "help" you with the thinking, we just noticed what's happening when you think about holding that thought?

Patient: When I try to notice what's happening, it just makes the fortune-teller scream louder — my chest clamps, my breath gets tiny, my hands curl up, and the whole disaster replay starts: I’ll blurt, they’ll get defensive and stop calling, I’ll mess up at school and everything falls apart. It feels like the act of noticing is the match that lights the train-wreck, so I can’t stay with it without spiraling. I’m confused how noticing that would help — can we slow down a bit? I’m really overwhelmed.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's happening when you try to notice makes the panic show up even more – like the match that lights the fire. 

Can I ask you something? What happens when you're with that feeling – your chest clamping, your breath getting tiny – but you don't try to notice it? Not because you want to change it, but because it's what's showing up right now?

Patient: If I just sit with it and don't try to notice, it doesn't calm — it feels like pressure building under the surface until I snap without warning. My breath gets tiny, my hands clench, and I blurt something that makes them defensive, they stop calling, and the whole nightmare replays. I know that sounds extreme, but I can't help it — I'm really overwhelmed, can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really stuck between trying to notice the panic and the feeling of needing to snap – like the pressure building under the surface. When you say "I know that sounds extreme," what matters most to you right now – staying connected to the feeling or avoiding the "nightmare" that seems to be happening?

Patient: Staying connected matters most — I can't bear the idea of losing them, that's everything to me. But the moment I try to protect that connection the fortune-teller goes off: I'll say one little thing, they'll take it wrong and cut me off, I'll spiral and mess up at work, and everything will collapse. I'm torn and really overwhelmed by that loop — can we slow down a bit? I don't know how to choose without it feeling like a trap.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to protect the connection with them, but that's making the panic show up even more – like the trap you're worried about getting caught in. When you say "I'm torn" and "I don't know how to choose," what would happen if you just made room for both wanting to connect and wanting to avoid the nightmare – not because you're trying to fix it, but because it's what's showing up right now?

Patient: If I try to make room for both, it just feels like being pulled apart — like the fortune-teller gets louder on both sides and I'm split in half. I can picture myself trying to be gentle and then blurting out something awful anyway, them shutting down, me spiraling at work, and it all collapsing, and honestly that image just wipes me out — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like trying to make room for both feels like being pulled apart – like the loudness of the fortune-teller on both sides. When you say "that image just wipes me out," what would happen if you just noticed it – that image – without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: When I try to just notice it, the image turns into a full movie — me blurting something, them cutting me off, me screwing up at school, everyone turning away — and the tightness just gets worse. It doesn't calm me, it just drains me like I'm holding a live grenade that's about to go off. I honestly don't see how noticing that would help — can we slow down and talk about what we'd even do next?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the image still leads to the tightness getting worse, and that's really overwhelming. 

Instead of trying to notice it anymore, what if we just looked at what you're trying to protect – that connection with them – and what matters most to you in that moment?

Patient: What matters most is that they still need me and that I'm not useless — that there's still some connection so I don't end up alone. But when I focus on protecting that, the fortune-teller kicks in: I try to reach out, they recoil, stop calling, everyone thinks I'm a wreck, and I'm left humiliated and alone. I don't see how talking about what matters helps without that movie starting up — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like when you focus on protecting that connection, the fortune-teller shows up anyway – like the fear of being useless and alone. 

What if, instead of trying to protect that connection, we just looked at what's happening when you try to reach out to them – when you feel like you're trying to hold onto something that matters?

Patient: When I try to reach out my chest clamps, my voice goes tight, and the fortune-teller immediately scripts the whole thing — I say something clumsy, they recoil and stop calling, I start flubbing lessons, colleagues whisper, and I'm left humiliated and alone. It feels inevitable, like a chain reaction that always happens, and I can't make myself believe any other ending. I'm wiped out just saying that and really overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the chain reaction of thoughts is really overwhelming you. When you say "I'm wiped out just saying that," what matters most to you right now – not what's happening in your chest or with the fortune-teller, but what's showing up when you're feeling that "wiped out" –

Patient: What matters most is that I'm still needed and not seen as useless — that there's someone who still thinks I'm okay. When I'm wiped out, my brain instantly imagines that need getting ripped away: they stop calling, colleagues whisper, everyone thinks I'm a mess, and I'm left alone and humiliated. I'm drained just saying that — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the need for being seen and needed is really important to you, but when you're feeling wiped out, that need gets hijacked by the fear of losing it – like the imaginary ripping away. 

What if, when that happens, you could notice that need for being seen and needed, *without* trying to stop the thought of losing it?

Patient: If I try to notice the need without pushing away the fear, it just blows up—my chest clamps, the fortune-teller scripts the whole disaster: I reach out, they recoil and stop calling, I flub at school, colleagues whisper, and I'm left humiliated. Holding both feels impossible; it just turns the panic louder and other outcomes sound like wishful thinking. I'm pretty wiped out—can we slow down a bit? I don't know how to do this without spiraling.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the need without pushing away the fear is actually making the panic worse – like the chest clamping and the fortune-teller showing up again. 

When you say "I'm pretty wiped out," what would it be like to just be with that feeling, not because you're trying to stop the panic, but because it's what's showing up right now?

Patient: I try to be with that wiped-out feeling, but it just drags me down—the chest clamps, my breath disappears, and the fortune-teller blares the whole movie: they cut me off, students notice, colleagues whisper, and I'm finished. Being with it feels like holding a live grenade; I can't sit with it without spiraling. I'm really overwhelmed—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like being with that wiped-out feeling feels like being on the verge of falling apart – like holding a live grenade. 

Can I ask you one more thing? What would it be like to be with that feeling *even if* it felt like you were spiraling – not because you wanted to stop spiraling, but because it's what's showing up right now?

Patient: If I try to be with it even while spiraling, it just feels like handing the fortune-teller a microphone — the panic gets louder, my chest clamps, my breath disappears, and the whole movie starts playing: I blurt, they recoil, they stop calling, I mess up at work and end up humiliated. I don't see how sitting with it wouldn't just prove the disaster right; it feels inevitable and I get more overwhelmed the more I try. Can we slow down a bit? I honestly don't know what we'd even do next.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to be with it even while spiraling feels like amplifying the panic – like handing the fortune-teller a microphone. 

Let's take a step back. When you say "I don't see how sitting with it wouldn't just prove the disaster right," what matters most to you right now – not what happens when you try to sit with it, but what matters when you're already feeling overwhelmed?

Patient: What matters most is that I'm still needed and seen — that I'm not useless and someone still wants me around. When I'm overwhelmed I just want a guarantee they won't leave, but my brain keeps insisting that any reach will make them recoil and everything will collapse. Saying that wears me out — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like what matters most is that feeling of being needed and seen – like being valued by them. When you say "I just want a guarantee they won't leave," what would it be like if that guarantee wasn't something you could control – if it was more about what matters when you're feeling that need to be seen?

Patient: If I can't control that guarantee, my brain goes nuts — the fortune-teller screams that one small thing will make them pull away, I'll look pathetic at school, colleagues will judge me, and I'll end up alone and useless. The idea of not being able to make sure they stay terrifies me; it feels like tipping over a cliff and I can't stand the not-knowing. I'm getting really overwhelmed just saying that — can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of not being able to control that guarantee feels like a huge risk – like standing on the edge of the cliff. When you say "the idea of not being able to make sure they stay terrifies me," what matters most to you in that moment – not what happens if you can't control it, but what matters when you're already feeling that terrified feeling?

Patient: What matters in that terrified moment is feeling seen and wanted — some small, real sign that I'm not already lost. If I don't get that, my brain immediately films the worst: one mistake, they pull away, calls stop, colleagues judge me, and I'm finished. Saying that makes me feel drained and shaky—can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: It sounds like in that terrified moment, what matters most is feeling seen and wanted – like having a small lifeline to hold onto. When you say "if I don't get that, my brain immediately films the worst," what would it be like if, for just a moment, you could notice that fear *without* the worst-case scenario playing out?

Patient: I'm not sure what you mean by "without the worst-case"—the second I try to notice the fear the fortune-teller fires up: my chest clamps, my breath disappears, and I'm already scripting them cutting me off, kids stopping calls, me flubbing at school and being humiliated. I don't see how noticing wouldn't just make the movie louder; I'm getting wiped out saying this—can we slow down a bit?
