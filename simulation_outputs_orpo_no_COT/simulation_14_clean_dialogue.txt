Patient: Hey, thanks for taking me on—I usually try to stay upbeat, but I've been leaning on drinking and weed more to numb this ache since I lost someone, and it's become my go-to. My brain's like a fortune-telling machine that only spits out disasters—if I keep this up I'll tank my art career, push everyone away, lose my place, and end up completely alone, and I can already see the whole messy chain playing out. People tell me other outcomes are possible, but I just can't buy that; it all feels inevitable and that certainty is what makes me reach for the numbness.

Therapist: It sounds like having that 'disaster' future feeling so strongly—where the thought of what might happen if you don't change it feels like it's already happening—is what keeps you reaching for the numbness. What would it be like for just 30 seconds if you weren't sure what would happen when you woke up tomorrow, or what the 'disaster' would look like?

Patient: Honestly, 30 seconds of not knowing would feel like my head's falling out—like freefall with no script and I can't stand it. My brain instantly fills the gap with the worst-case: I wake up ruined—no clients, no friends, homeless—and that feeling of inevitability is exactly why I reach for booze or weed to shut it off. I know people say other things could happen, but those disaster stories feel way more real and immediate to me.

Therapist: So when that 30-second gap shows up, it feels like your whole world is falling apart, and that's what makes the numbness feel necessary to hold onto. Would you be willing to try noticing that'my head's falling out' feeling, even just for a moment, while you're still holding onto the booze or weed?

Patient: Okay, I can try noticing it for a moment while I'm still holding a drink, but my chest's already tightening and my brain's yelling that if I actually feel it I'll lose control—say something stupid to a client, blow a commission, push everyone away, and spiral into being homeless. So I'll try, but honestly I don't expect to make it through without wanting to numb it; it just feels impossible not to.

Therapist: The chest tightness and the brain's "you'll lose control" story are already showing up, even before you try to notice the numbness. Would you be willing to make room for that feeling in the space between noticing the numbness and reaching for the drink?

Patient: Okay—I can try to make room for it, but honestly I can only imagine holding it for like ten seconds before my brain starts shouting the whole disaster script: I say something stupid to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street. I don't really believe this will change anything, so if we're doing this I need you to help me stay with it because I'm definitely going to want to numb it fast.

Therapist: The "I can only hold it for ten seconds" feeling is like a prediction of what will happen. What if, instead of trying to hold it for ten seconds, you were to just notice it while you're still holding onto the drink?

Patient: Okay, I can try to notice it while I'm still holding the drink, but my chest's already tight and the disaster voice is ramping up—like, I'm hearing the whole end-of-the-world script: I’ll say something dumb to a client, lose the commission, get kicked out, end up alone on the street. Noticing it feels scary because it just gives that voice more air, so I need you to stay with me and keep me anchored or I’ll reach for the numbness fast.

Therapist: It sounds like the disaster voice is really loud right now, and noticing it feels like it's fueling it. I'm not trying to stop the voice or change what you're hearing—it's just being present with you while you hold the drink.

Patient: Okay—when you say that it actually makes the disaster voice crank up louder, like it's getting hungry for the script: I say one stupid thing to a client, lose the gig, can't pay rent, and bam—I'm on the street. I'm already shaky and the drink feels like the only thing that mutes that certainty, so please keep talking to me and stay with me, because I'm honestly gonna want to numb this fast.

Therapist: It's like the disaster voice is craving that script to be true, and noticing it makes it feel more urgent. I'm here with you, and I'm not going anywhere. What if, instead of reaching for the drink to make that script not true, we could just be with the feeling of being shaky and wanting to numb it, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know if I can just "be" with it — my hands are already shaking and my head's on a loop saying I'll say something stupid to a client, lose the commission, get evicted, end up on the street. I'll try to stay with the shakiness if you keep talking me through it, because otherwise I swear I'll reach for the drink. I'm really scared this won't change anything, so please don't let this be one of those exercises where you check out and I get left alone with the panic.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really scared that trying to stay with the shakiness won't make a difference, and that's what's keeping you from letting go of the drink. But what if, just for a moment, we could try to notice that the shaking is what matters, not the thoughts about losing your commission or getting evicted?

Patient: Okay—I’ll try to notice the shaking, but my hands are already trembling and my brain's blasting that whole movie—say something dumb, lose the commission, be homeless—so it feels pointless to focus on my body when the future’s already ruined. I can maybe stay with the shakiness for ten seconds if you keep talking me through it and tell me what to do (count with me, or name sensations?), because otherwise I swear I’ll reach for the drink. I’m really skeptical this will change anything, but I’ll try if you stay with me.

Therapist: It's like the brain is trying to make sense of the shaking, and that's what's making it feel like the future is already ruined. I'm here to help you notice that the shaking itself is what matters, not the thoughts about it. What if, for just one second, you could say "I'm shaking" without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay—I'm shaking. I'm saying it: I'm shaking. It doesn't make the disaster voice any quieter though; it's already yelling that I'll say something stupid to a client, lose the commission, get evicted, and end up on the street—so please keep talking me through this, because if you check out I'll reach for the drink fast.

Therapist: The shaking stays, and the disaster voice keeps going. I'm not trying to stop it, just noticing that it's what matters right now. What if, while you're still saying "I'm shaking," we try to notice the feeling of the shaking a little more closely? Not the story about it, but the feeling of it. Can you say "I'm shaking" and then "What's it like in my hands right now" together?

Patient: I'm shaking. What's it like in my hands right now? They feel jittery and clammy, like the tremor runs from my forearms to my fingertips and my grip keeps slipping — and honestly I don't follow how noticing that is supposed to stop me from blurting something stupid to a client and losing everything. The disaster voice just gets louder when I focus on it, so you have to keep talking me through this or I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: The shaking stays, and you notice the feeling of it more closely. It's like you're trying to push it away with the disaster voice, but it's not working. What if, instead of trying to stop the disaster voice, we just keep noticing the shaking and the feeling of it? Not because it's making it stop, but because it's what's right here, right now.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how staring at my hands is supposed to help — it just feels like feeding the disaster voice. My hands are still clammy and my brain's already playing the whole movie: I say something dumb, lose the client, can't pay rent, end up on the street. If we're going to do this, you have to keep talking me through it — count with me or name things — because otherwise I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: It feels like staring at your hands is what the disaster voice wants you to do. What if, instead of staring, we counted together? Just numbers, one by one, without any story about them. "One... two... three..."

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how counting's supposed to help, but okay — one... Two — my brain's already yelling that counting won't change a thing: I'll still say something dumb to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, and be on the street. Three — I'm shaking and I seriously need you to keep talking me through this or I'm gonna reach for the drink.

Therapist: The counting stays, and the brain's voice keeps going. It's like you're trying to push it away, but it's what matters right now. What if, while you're counting, you said "I'm shaking" one more time? Just that one phrase, without trying to change it. "I'm shaking. One... two... three..."

Patient: I'm shaking. One... two... three... I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help — it just feels like feeding the disaster voice. My brain's already yelling that counting won't stop me from saying something stupid to a client, losing the commission, getting evicted, and ending up on the street, so please keep talking me through this or I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: It feels like counting isn't working. What if, instead of trying to stop the disaster voice, we tried to notice what's happening when you say "I'm shaking." What does it feel like, exactly, when you say that phrase?

Patient: When I say "I'm shaking" it actually makes the panic louder — my chest clamps down, breathing gets shallow, my hands tremble from my forearms to my fingertips, my stomach drops and everything narrows like a tunnel. At the same time my brain immediately starts the disaster movie — I'll say something dumb to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street — and I don't really follow how naming the shaking is supposed to stop that; it just feels like feeding the voice. If we're doing this, you have to keep talking me through it — count with me or name things in the room — because otherwise I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: The panic shows up when you say "I'm shaking." It's like your body is trying to protect itself. What if, while that's happening, we noticed the sound of your breath? Just the sound of it, without trying to change it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is listening to my breath supposed to help with any of this? Okay, I can hear it: short, a bit raspy, high in my chest, like it's racing—and the more I notice it the louder the disaster voice gets: I say something dumb to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street. If we're doing this, you have to keep talking me through it, because otherwise I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: The sound of your breath is what matters, not what you think about it. What if, while you're still noticing that racing sound, you said "I'm noticing this sound" just one more time? Not to change it, but to stay with it.

Patient: Okay... I'm noticing this sound — it's short and rasping, high in my chest. I don't really follow how that helps; it just makes the disaster voice louder — I'll say something dumb to a client, lose the commission, end up on the street — so please keep talking me through this, because I'm going to want the drink.

Therapist: The sound stays, and the disaster voice keeps going. What if, instead of trying to stop the voice, we noticed what's happening when you try to reach for the drink? What would it feel like, right then, if you didn't grab it?

Patient: If I didn't grab it, I'd get hit with this hot shame and panic like a wave — my hands would jitter, my chest would lock, and that disaster voice would go straight to the worst: I'll blurt something, lose the client, can't pay rent, end up out on the street. It feels like old failures pressing in and I don't have the energy to fight it alone, so you have to keep talking me through this or I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: The shame and panic feel like they're already happening, even if you don't grab the drink. What if, instead of trying to fight them, you just noticed what's already there? Not to change it, but to see it. Like noticing the wave when you're already on it, without trying to swim against it.

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice the wave instead of fighting it, but it feels like I'm watching myself get pulled under and it's kind of exhausting. Noticing it drags up this hot, stupid shame and my brain immediately goes full disaster narrator — I picture blurting something to a client, losing the commission, ending up on the street, and it all feels inevitable. I don't really trust that just looking at it will help, so you have to keep talking me through it and naming things, because if you check out I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: It feels like noticing the wave is what matters, even if it's exhausting. What if, instead of trying to notice it, we noticed the breath that's already there, even when you're watching yourself get pulled under? Noticing the breath while you're already noticing the wave.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to notice the breath while I'm watching the wave. It's shallow and tight in my chest, like it's racing away from the panic—but as soon as I notice it the disaster voice goes full blast: I'll blurt something to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street. Noticing this drags up that stupid shame from before and I don't have the energy to do it alone, so please keep talking me through it or I'll reach for the drink.

Therapist: The breath stays, even if it feels like it's racing away from the panic. What if, instead of noticing the breath while it's racing, we noticed it right now, just for one second, without trying to change it? Not to stop the panic, but just to be with the breath, even if it feels like it's struggling.

Patient: Okay... I can try for one second — my breath's tight and shallow, like it's stuck up near my ribs. The moment I notice it the disaster voice kicks in—I'll blurt something to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street—and this drags up that hot, stupid shame, so please keep talking me through it or I swear I'll reach for the drink.

Therapist: The tightness in your chest stays, and the disaster voice keeps going. What if, instead of noticing the tightness while it's making the voice louder, you noticed the space around the tightness? Not the tightness itself, but the space where it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how do I notice a 'space' when everything feels like a tight, hot knot? I'll try: there's this thin, cold ring around the clench like an empty border, but honestly my brain's already narrating the whole disaster—I'll blurt something to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, end up on the street—so please keep talking me through this or I'm definitely going to reach for the drink.

Therapist: The knot stays, and the disaster voice keeps going. What if, instead of trying to notice the space around the knot, you noticed what would happen if you let the cold ring stay, even for just a moment, while the disaster voice is talking? Not to change what's happening, but to see what's possible while it's still happening.

Patient: I can try to let the cold ring sit for a moment, but I don't really get how that helps — it just feels like making more space for the disaster voice. If I do, the shame and panic will slam back in and I'll see myself blurting to a client, losing the commission, getting evicted, ending up on the street. I'll try for a moment if you keep talking me through it, because I can't do this alone.

Therapist: It sounds like letting the cold ring sit is what matters, even if it doesn't feel like making space for the disaster voice. What if, instead of trying to stop the shame and panic, you noticed what would happen if the disaster voice was just there, while you let the cold ring sit?

Patient: Okay—I can try to let the disaster voice be while the cold ring sits, but the second I do it goes full movie: I blurt something dumb to a client, lose the commission, can't pay rent, get evicted, and end up on the street—like it's already written. I'll try to stay with it if you keep talking me through it and naming things, because I don't trust this will help and I'm definitely going to want the drink otherwise.

Therapist: The movie stays, and the shame and panic come back. What if, instead of trying to stop the movie, you noticed what would happen if you just sat with the cold ring while the movie played on? Not to change the story, but to see what's possible while the story is still happening.

Patient: Okay... I can try to sit with the cold ring while the movie plays, but it feels like I'm watching my life get written in the worst way and I can't breathe. The second I do that voice screams I'll blurt something to a client, lose the gig, get evicted and end up on the street — I don't trust this will help, so please keep naming things or counting with me, because I'm absolutely going to want to numb this if you check out.

Therapist: The screaming voice stays, and the movie keeps playing. What if, instead of trying to stop the screaming voice, you noticed what would happen if you counted with me while the movie was still playing?

Patient: Okay... I'll try to count with you, though I don't think it'll change anything — my chest's already clamping and that voice is screaming I'll blurt to a client, lose the commission, get evicted, end up on the street. One... two... three... please keep counting with me, I'm shaky and ashamed and I'll reach for the drink if you stop.

Therapist: The counting stays, and the chest clamping and screaming voice keep going. One... two... three... Four... Five... Six... What would it be like if, for just one moment, you kept counting while the screaming voice was still there?

Patient: If I keep counting it sort of holds the screaming voice back for a few beats — like a thin dam — but after a handful of counts the movie just breaks through and I can already see myself blurting to a client, losing the commission, getting evicted, ending up on the street. It helps a little while you keep going, but I'm worn out and that stupid failure keeps flashing up and making me feel ashamed. Please keep counting with me — one... two... three...
