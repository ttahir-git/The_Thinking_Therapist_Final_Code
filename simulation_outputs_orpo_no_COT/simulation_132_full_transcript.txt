--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been leaning on asking people for reassurance a lot lately to dull this constant anxiety since my partner died. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop and it just leaves me feeling stuck and kind of pathetic. I've tried quitting before and it didn't work—so how is talking about this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When you ask for reassurance, what happens right after you do—like, a moment later—is that feeling of stuckness or pathethness come back?

Patient: Yeah — for a few minutes after someone reassures me I actually feel lighter, like I can breathe. But it never sticks; the worry creeps back and then I feel even more ashamed and stuck for having needed that in the first place. I've told people this and tried to stop — so seriously, how is talking about it going to make that cycle change?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: What would it look like for you to notice that moment of lightness *while* the worry is coming back—instead of waiting for it to stay?

Patient: I guess it would be like catching myself right as the breath eases and the worry sneaks back—noticing the relief and the return of panic at the same time instead of just waiting to see if the relief sticks. But honestly, that sounds like the mindfulness stuff I've tried and it didn't break the loop—so how is noticing supposed to stop the shame that comes after? Maybe it'd mean literally naming both things out loud—“I feel lighter and I'm scared this won't last”—but I'm skeptical that saying it will actually loosen the grip.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: Would you be willing to try that small experiment with shame too—when you notice it coming up—while holding onto noticing the lighter feeling?

Patient: Fine — I'll try it, but I'm really skeptical. I can say out loud something like, "I feel a little lighter, and I also feel ashamed," when both come up, but I'm not convinced naming it will stop the cycle. If this just makes me more stuck in the feeling, I'm going to get frustrated — so how exactly is saying that supposed to change anything?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: What would it be like for you to say that phrase, "I feel a little lighter, and I also feel ashamed," *when* the shame starts to come up—*not* because you think it will make a difference, but just to notice it *right there*, without trying to stop it?

Patient: It'd feel awkward and embarrassing to say out loud—like admitting I'm needy when I shouldn't be. Maybe if I said it right when the shame starts I'd catch both the little relief and the panic together instead of spiraling, and that tiny noticing could make the shame less all-consuming. But I'm skeptical—I'm worried saying it will just cement the feeling and make me feel even more pathetic. How is saying that supposed to help?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: When you say it out loud, what's holding you from doing it because of that worry about feeling "pathetic"?

Patient: Mostly it's fear—like if I say it out loud I'm admitting I'm needy and that makes me feel exposed, like people will think less of me. I also worry that naming it will harden it into a fact, like I'm labeling myself "pathetic" and can't undo that. And honestly, I've been told to "just be honest" before and it didn't help, so how is saying this supposed to change those judgments?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: What would it be like for you to say, "I'm worried that saying it out loud will make me feel exposed and pathetic" *right now*, *while* you're holding onto that thought about needing reassurance—instead of trying to change the thought or make it go away?

Patient: If I said that right now, my chest would tighten and I'd feel my face go hot—like I'm admitting I'm broken in front of someone. Maybe there'd be a tiny flicker of relief for getting it out, but I'm really worried it just hands people more ammunition to think less of me. I'll try saying it if you want, but honestly—how is this actually different from the times I've already been honest and got nothing?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Let's make a tiny space for what matters to you, even if saying it out loud feels scary. What's one small step you could take with me right now, just to try it out—like making that tiny word choice, even if it feels like it doesn't matter?

Patient: Alright — I'll try it. "I feel a little lighter, and I also feel ashamed." Saying that already makes my chest tighten and my face feel hot, and honestly, if this doesn't do anything I'm going to get frustrated.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing the feeling of shame and the physical sensations that come with it—while still trying to hold onto that small step of making the word choice. That takes a lot of courage.

Patient: Okay... saying that actually did make a tiny dent — my chest loosened a bit — but I'm still bracing. How is that supposed to help me stop grabbing for reassurance an hour from now when the panic spikes? I need something practical, not just noticing; what would you have me do next in the moment when the urge hits so I'm not left feeling exposed and pathetic?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: What if, when the panic spikes *and* you feel that shame, you could try to *make room* for that feeling *right there*, *not* to stop it, but to notice it—while also taking care of that physical sensation in your chest?

Patient: I can try, but I'm skeptical — making room sounds fine in theory, but I need something that actually interrupts the urge. Right now I imagine noticing the tightness, naming it ("this is panic/shame"), putting my hand on my chest, and taking a slow breath or two to soften it — but honestly, I've done breathing before and it doesn't stop me from calling someone an hour later. So tell me one concrete thing or one short phrase I can do or say in that exact moment that might actually keep me from reaching out for reassurance.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: What if, when you feel that panic spike, you could say to yourself, "I need to take care of my body," *right now*, *not* to change the thought, but to make space for it?

Patient: Alright — I'll try saying, "I need to take care of my body" when the panic hits, but I'm not convinced it'll stop me from calling someone an hour later. I guess that would look like putting my hand on my chest, doing a few slow breaths, maybe standing up and getting a glass of water or pacing for a minute instead of reaching for my phone. If that's what you mean, fine — but if that still fails, tell me what the next concrete move is, because I'm tired of tricks that only feel helpful for five minutes.


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: When you've tried that, what would it take for you to consider not calling someone for just one hour—just to see if you can find a different way to get through that feeling?

Patient: I can try not calling for an hour, but I'm already bracing — my chest tightens thinking about failing like I have before and that shame just makes the urge louder. I'd only consider it if we do something concrete: I put my phone in another room, set a timer for an hour, and commit to three short things during that time (10 min walk, 10 min writing what I'm feeling, 10 slow breaths with my hand on my chest), then check in with you or send one message after the hour. And be straight with me — if that still doesn't work, what’s the actual backup plan, because I’m tired of half-measures that just make me feel worse.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: I can see that you're willing to take a risk if it means finding a way to break the cycle. What if, when the timer goes off, you *don't* check in with me or send a message—just because it's hard to see that you might be able to make it through that hour without calling someone, even if it feels like you're not good enough?

Patient: I...that idea makes my chest clamp up — I'm already hearing that voice from the last time I failed, and the shame spikes hard. Maybe I'd try it only if there's a really small safety valve: like I can send one single, prewritten message at the hour that just says "I made it through an hour" and nothing else, or you agree to a fallback plan if I can't hold it. But honestly—how is asking me not to check in supposed to help when all I can imagine is failing again? If that fails, what's the next concrete backup you actually expect me to do?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to acknowledge the difficulty of holding back without making it about failing or being good enough. What if, when you're feeling that chest clamp up, you could *just* notice it *right there*, without trying to change it—without the message to the other person or the expectation of success?

Patient: If I "just notice" right then, it feels like I'm letting the shame sit with me—and that voice that always says I blew it already starts yelling, so noticing can just turn into rumination. I might try it, but only if there’s a real safety plan: phone in another room, a timer, and the one prewritten message at the hour as a fallback—otherwise I'm just setting myself up to feel worse. Seriously, how is sitting with that clamp in my chest supposed to actually stop me from reaching for my phone an hour later?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to bridge the gap between noticing the discomfort and taking action. What if, when you notice that chest clamp, you could *do* something with it—like take a deep breath, or put your hand on your chest, or just *be* with it for a tiny moment—without needing to "fix" it or "change" it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try doing something with the clamp: hand on my chest, one slow breath, maybe stand up and get water. But honestly, that old voice that yells "you always mess up" kicks in and makes the urge louder, so how is that supposed to actually stop me from reaching for my phone? If this doesn't work, tell me one concrete backup move right now — not a vague idea, something I can actually do that might help.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to bridge the gap between noticing the discomfort and taking action. What if, when the voice kicks in and the urge to reach for your phone grows, you could *make a small commitment to yourself*: "I'll put my phone on the counter for just 5 more minutes" *right now*, no matter what.

Patient: Alright — fine, I'll try the 5 minutes, but my chest's already tight and that voice from before is yelling I blew it, so I'm bracing and pissed off. Here's what I'll actually do: put my phone in the other room, set a timer for 5 minutes, and if I reach for it before the timer's up I agree to send one single prewritten message that says, "I couldn't do the 5 minutes." If that happens, tell me now — what exact concrete step do you want me to do next, not some vague consolation?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: If you reach for your phone before the timer's up, I want you to *write down exactly what you'd say to yourself if you saw that message on your phone*—not what you think you should say, but what you'd actually say to yourself right then.

Patient: Fine — if I grabbed my phone early I'd write exactly this to myself: "Of course you couldn't do it. You always cave. You're needy and pathetic. Why even try? You blew it again."  

Saying that makes my chest tighten just thinking about it — it's ugly but it's honest. So now what — how is writing that to myself supposed to help?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like writing that to yourself actually brings up the pain and shame you were trying to avoid. What if, instead of trying to change the message or stop thinking about it, you could *pause* with that thought *right there*, and then look at what you need to hold onto in order to make the 5 minutes work—like, what would it take for you to stay present with that timer for just 1 minute longer?

Patient: Okay — here's what would actually help me stay with the timer for one more minute: put my phone in the other room, set a one-minute timer, press my feet into the floor, grip something cold or a stress ball, and say out loud, "I can wait 60 seconds," while taking two slow breaths. Saying that right when the shame slams into my chest might blunt the urge long enough to get through it, but that slam is real and makes me want to bail — so I'm still braced and pissed off. If that doesn't work, tell me exactly what you want me to do next right now, not more mindfulness fluff.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: If you can wait for 60 seconds without reaching for your phone, I want you to notice what happens to the urge to call someone while you're waiting for the timer to go off *right now*, and then *after* the timer goes off.

Patient: Right now, during the 60 seconds my chest slammed tight for the first 15–20 seconds and that voice—“you always cave”—got loud and ugly, but pressing my feet into the floor, gripping the stress ball, and saying “I can wait 60 seconds” pulled the urge down from a shout to a low hum. When the timer went off there was a tiny rush of relief, like a little loosened knot, but immediately after the shame crept back in and I started bracing for the next spike—already picturing myself failing again.  

This helped a hair, but I’m not convinced it’ll hold for an hour. If the urge comes back in 10 minutes, tell me one exact concrete thing I should do in that moment—no mindfulness fluff, something I can actually do that won’t leave me feeling exposed if it fails.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: If the urge comes back in 10 minutes, I want you to *write down exactly what you'd say to your friend if they called you right then*—not what you think you should say, but what you'd actually say to them *in that exact moment*.

Patient: If my friend called I'd probably blurt out something like: "Hey — I'm not doing great, my chest is really tight and I'm starting to panic. I know this is a lot, but can you just tell me I'm okay for a few minutes? I don't want to be a burden, I just need someone to stay with me."  

Saying that already makes me feel exposed and ridiculous — I can feel the shame spike — so I'm honest: I don't trust that writing this down will stop me from calling anyway. How is this supposed to actually help me next time the urge hits?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're right to be skeptical that writing it down will stop you from calling. What if, instead of trying to avoid calling, you could *make a tiny commitment to yourself* right now—when the urge hits—just to make the phone stay on the counter for 5 more seconds?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try the five seconds. When the urge hits I’ll put the phone on the counter, press my feet into the floor, grip the stress ball, and say out loud “I can wait five seconds” while I count down, but just thinking about it makes my chest clamp and that old failure voice starts yelling. So be blunt with me — if those five seconds don’t stop me, what exactly do you want me to do next?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: If those 5 seconds don't stop you from picking up the phone, I want you to *call your emergency contact*—not because you need reassurance, but because you need to get the *physical act* of calling out of your system.

Patient: Fine — if the five seconds don't hold, I'll call my emergency contact, but I already feel like I'm admitting defeat and that old failure voice is roaring in my head, making me feel pathetic and exposed. If I call, I'll probably say, "I can't stop myself from calling — I need to get the urge out of my system; can you stay with me for five minutes while I breathe?" Honestly, I don't trust this will fix anything, so be blunt — if that call doesn't help, tell me right now the exact next concrete step you want me to take.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: If you call and still feel like you need to call your partner, I want you to *pull up your partner's emergency contact information right now*—not because you need to call them, but because you need to get your phone out of your hand.

Patient: I could pull it up, but just thinking about it makes my chest tighten and that old shame floods in — like I'm failing all over again. It feels like admitting defeat, like I'm reaching for them instead of dealing, so tell me straight: how is having their info on my screen supposed to actually get the phone out of my hand more than just putting it in another room? If you want me to try it, I'm willing, but I'm already bracing that this will just make me feel worse.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're right to be skeptical that having their info on your screen will help. What if, instead of trying to control the urge with your phone, you could *make a small space for the urge to be there*—just for a tiny moment—while you're holding your phone *right now*?

Patient: Alright — holding my phone right now makes my hands shake and my chest tighten; that old, ugly shame is already crawling up my throat. Making space for the urge feels like I'm just giving it room to win, but fine — I'll try holding it for ten seconds, naming the urge out loud ("I feel this urge to call"), and feeling whatever comes up. Honestly, though — how is that supposed to keep me from dialing once the urge gets louder?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: If you hold it for 10 seconds and the urge gets louder, I want you to *notice what happens when you put your finger on the home button*—not to stop the urge, but just to notice what happens when you touch the phone.

Patient: When I rest my finger on the home button my hands quake, my chest clamps, and that old "you always cave" voice starts blasting—it's like reliving a failure and it makes me furious and ashamed. Just noticing that feels risky, like I'm one slip away from proving I'm pathetic, so I'm not sold that this will help. Fine — I'll try holding it for ten seconds and notice, but if the urge gets louder, what exact concrete step do you want me to take next?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: If the urge gets louder and you still need to get the phone out of your hand, I want you to *open the Messages app and type "I need to talk to you" to your partner*—not because you need to talk to them, but because you need to get your phone out of your hand.

Patient: Ugh — just hearing that makes my chest clamp and this hot shame wash over me, like I'm back in that humiliating place I hate thinking about. Typing "I need to talk to you" feels like admitting defeat and begging, and that alone will probably make the urge louder, not smaller. Fine — I'll try it: I'll open Messages, type those words (won't hit send), put the phone down and do the five-second/one-minute thing we practiced — but be straight with me now: if that doesn't work, what exact concrete move do you want me to take next?
