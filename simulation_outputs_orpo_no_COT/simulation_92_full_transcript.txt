--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been preoccupied with an enduring, low-grade sadness and a pervasive lack of motivation that I attribute to a recent, quite destabilizing family conflict. As a business owner, my executive functioning feels compromised—projects stall, decisions feel attenuated—and it's seeping into my relationship, though I tend to intellectualize the experience rather than sit with the affect. I notice I describe causal frameworks and behavioral patterns instead of saying, plainly, that I'm scared or hurt, because that distance feels safer even if it's counterproductive.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a weight of sadness and hurt from the family conflict, and that's affecting your ability to connect with others and make decisions as a business owner. When you notice yourself intellectualizing about what's going on – describing causal frameworks and patterns – what happens if you were to pause that thought just for a moment and notice what's truly happening in your body when you think "I'm scared" or "I'm hurt"?

Patient: When I try to pause, there's a constriction in my chest and my breathing gets shallow, like there's a weight pressing just below my sternum, and my stomach knots up—my hands get clammy too. Immediately I catch myself cataloging those sensations, translating them into autonomic arousal and risk-assessment language because it's safer to analyze than to admit I'm shaken. I don't know, it's awkward and uncomfortable to just linger in the feeling instead of turning it into a theory.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: The cataloging starts to feel like a coping mechanism, but what if you could gently notice that cataloging *while* you're still noticing the constriction in your chest – not as a threat, but as a thing that's showing up right now?

Patient: Okay — I'll try that. When I try to hold both the cataloging and the chest tightness, the constriction actually intensifies and my breathing shortens, while my mind immediately goes into meta-mode—heart-rate, cortisol, contingency plans—which paradoxically escalates the somatic stuff instead of calming it. It feels precarious and a bit shameful to remain with it; I get queasy and an urge to strategize my way out, so can we slow down a bit?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding both the cataloging and the chest tightness makes the sensations even more uncomfortable, and that's making it harder to notice them without getting caught up in the "what if" stories. What if, instead of trying to push through or control the sensations, you could say to yourself, "This is where I am – this tightness in my chest, this cataloging in my mind – right now"?

Patient: When I actually try saying it to myself, the language creates an observational stance that paradoxically heightens my interoceptive focus—so the tightness almost intensifies, as if naming it confirms there's something to be wary of. My mind immediately repurposes the phrase into a problem-solving scaffold—"okay, what's the risk, what's the plan"—which keeps me at arm's length from feeling. This is making me a bit queasy, so can we slow down and just sit with that for a minute?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the language itself is creating a bit of a feedback loop – noticing the tightness and cataloging it is making it worse, and then trying to solve the problem is making it worse too. What if, instead of trying to solve the problem, you could just lean into that feeling of queasiness for a moment, without trying to make it go away?

Patient: If I actually try to lean into it, there's this buzzing nausea and a hollow pressure in my solar plexus like an alarm going off. Immediately my brain transliterates it into hypotheses—neurological arousal, endocrine cascade, contingency planning—which neutralizes the attempt to just feel it and makes the queasiness worse. I'm getting a bit queasy just talking about it, so can we slow down and sit with that a little without turning it into a problem to solve?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It feels like you're getting stuck in this cycle of noticing the sensations, translating them into something else, and then trying to change it. What if, right now, you simply allowed the queasiness to be there, without trying to make it go away or translate it into something else? Not even noticing what that would be – just letting it be there, like the buzzing of the alarm.

Patient: Okay, I'll try. When I let the queasiness be, it actually expands—this hollow pressure in my solar plexus and a kind of electric jitter—and immediately my cognition annexes it as an 'alarm signal' and starts generating contingency narratives, which yanks me back into analysis. It's uncomfortable and a little humiliating; I get this urge to escape or fix it, so can we slow down and sit with it for a minute while I attempt not to intellectualize?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already noticing that the queasiness expands, and your mind is trying to fix it. What if, instead of trying to escape or fix it, you simply noticed that thought – "I'm trying to intellectualize again" – and allowed it to be there, without judgment? Not to change it, but just to notice it as you're doing it.

Patient: When I notice the thought "I'm intellectualizing again," there's a brief looseness — like I can see the machinery — but almost immediately my mind reframes that noticing as another meta-strategy, which drags me back into analysis and contingency mapping. My chest eases a hair when I acknowledge it, but then shame and this urge to optimize the feeling spike my heart-rate again. I want to try holding the noticing without commentary, but it's awkward and I feel queasy — can we slow down so I can actually attempt it?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to notice the thought "I'm intellectualizing again" without judgment, but your mind is already pulling that thought into analysis. What if, instead of trying to change that thought, you simply *held* the noticing – not as a "I'm intellectualizing again," but just as the noticing itself – for a tiny moment? Not to fix it, not to change it, just to see what happens when you hold it without trying to comment on it.

Patient: I try to hold the noticing itself, and for a very brief second there’s a small loosening—like the machinery flickers and my chest eases. But almost instantly my cognition recapitulates it as a meta-strategy, turning the noticing into another item on my mental checklist, which brings shame and a queasy tightness back. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed trying to keep it simple—can we slow down so I can try to stay with it a little longer?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress by holding the noticing itself, but your mind is still trying to use it as a tool. What if, instead of trying to "stay with it," you simply *allowed* the noticing to be there – not for a long time, but just for a tiny moment – and then gently let it go? Not to fix it, not to change it, but just to see what happens when you release it.

Patient: I tried that just now—there was this very brief attenuation of the tightness, like a small slack in the chest, but almost immediately my mind reified the noticing into another procedural checkpoint and the relief evaporated. It feels humiliatingly mechanical—shame and a queasy tightness reasserting themselves—and I can already feel the urge to analyze how to prevent it. Can we slow down so I can try holding that tiny noticing a bit longer without turning it into another task?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting stuck in this loop of noticing the noticing, and your mind is trying to use it as a way to control the feeling. What if, instead of trying to hold onto that noticing, you simply *noticed* that your mind is trying to use it as a way to control the feeling – and then let that noticing be there, without trying to change it? Not to fix it, not to analyze it, but just to see what happens when you notice it as a thought, rather than trying to make it go away.

Patient: Conceptually that resonates—I can see, at least in theory, how noticing the mind’s instrumentalization of the noticing could undercut its power. When I actually try it, there's a tiny decoupling—a slight slackening in the chest—but almost instantly my cognition reterritorializes the observation into another contingency plan and the queasy shame comes back. I want to try holding that noticing-of-control without commentary, but it's awkward and I feel overwhelmed—can we slow down so I can attempt it without my mind hijacking it?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to notice the noticing-of-control without commentary, but your mind is still trying to use it as a tool. What if, instead of trying to "hold" it, you simply *allowed* the noticing-of-control to be there – not to fix it, not to change it, but just to see what happens when you notice it as a thought, without trying to make it go away? Not for a long time, not to prevent it, but just to notice it as it is – a tiny, fleeting moment of noticing that you're noticing your mind's attempt to control the feeling.

Patient: I let that noticing-of-control sit for a very tiny moment and there was a faint loosening—my chest softened and the jitter quieted a bit. But almost immediately my cognition reterritorialized the observation into another metacognitive strategy, turning the relief into a problem to optimize, which drags shame and queasy tightness back. It's awkward and a little humiliating to stay with it; I can feel the urge to analyze how to prevent the hijack. Can we slow down so I can try to sustain that nonjudgmental noticing without my mind weaponizing it?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're making progress by noticing the noticing-of-control, even if it's just for a tiny moment. What if, instead of trying to "sustain" it, you simply *allowed* the noticing-of-control to be there – not for a long time, not to change it, but just to notice it as it is – as a fleeting moment of noticing that you're noticing your mind's attempt to control the feeling. Without trying to fix it, without trying to make it go away, just to see what happens when you notice it without judgment.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is just "noticing it" supposed to interrupt the whole reterritorialization my mind does? When I try, my chest tightens, I get queasy and ashamed, and within seconds my brain turns the noticing into another procedural fix. I want to try, but it's awkward and I'm feeling overwhelmed—can we slow down and can you guide me through one very small step to do that?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how noticing it alone can interrupt the cycle of reterritorialization. That's a great question.

Here's what I'd like to try with you: for just one tiny moment, I want you to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out of your body – not the thoughts, not the emotions, just the sensation of the breath. Not to change it, not to fix it, just to notice it. *Just notice the breath moving in and out.*

Patient: Okay—I can try, though I'm not sure how just noticing the breath isn't going to become another data point for my mind to chew on. When I pay attention I feel air at my nostrils, a shallow lift in my chest, and then my brain instantaneously reframes it as respiratory rate, sympathetic arousal, contingency. Can you give me one very small, concrete cue to follow—like one slow inhale and one slow exhale—and can we slow down? I'm already feeling a bit queasy.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing the breath will just become another thought for your mind to analyze.

Here's a tiny, concrete cue: I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *right now*. Not the thought, not the emotion, just the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest. When you notice that sensation, slowly *inhale* for a count of 4...

Patient: My left hand is on the armrest—I can feel the fabric and a slight pressure under my palm. I inhaled slowly—one, two, three, four—and there was a small loosening in my chest, like the constriction softened for a beat, then my mind immediately transliterated it into metrics—respiratory cadence, vagal tone—and the queasy shame crept back. Can we slow down and do another very slow inhale-exhale together, but cue me for the exhale this time? I’m already feeling the urge to analyze it away.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the noticing of the sensation is still being used to control the feeling.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *again*. But this time, I want you to notice it *only* while you're exhaling *slowly*. When you exhale, say to yourself "I am letting go" or "I am releasing" – not to change it, but just to notice the sensation of letting go. When you're ready, slowly *exhale* for a count of 4...

Patient: I exhaled slowly for four and when I said to myself "I am letting go" there was a tiny slackening in my chest—just for a beat—but my mind instantly turned the phrase into another variable to measure (vagal tone, efficacy of cue), and the queasy tightness and shame snuck back in. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit absurdly theatrical doing this—can we slow down and do just one slower exhale together, with you guiding me through the count so I don't get pulled into analyzing it?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the noticing of letting go is still being used to control the feeling.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *while* I guide you through the exhale. On the count of 1, I'll say "inhale"... when you're ready, slowly exhale with me: "exhale... one..."

Patient: I exhaled with you—felt a brief slackening in the chest and a little warmth under my sternum, which was actually kind of surprising—and then my brain immediately started cataloging respiratory rate and vagal response, which sucked the relief back into analysis. I'm feeling a bit embarrassed and overwhelmed by how fast I hijack it—can we slow down and do one more slow exhale, and this time cue me to just stay with the body for three seconds afterward so I don't start measuring it?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the pattern of hijacking the relief.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *while* I guide you through the exhale. On the count of 1, I'll say "inhale"... when you're ready, slowly exhale with me: "exhale... one..." *pause* As you exhale, I want you to stay with the sensation in your body for *three seconds* – just notice it, without trying to change it or measure it.

Patient: I did the exhale and held the sensation for the three seconds — there was a brief slackening in my chest and a little warmth under my sternum, then almost immediately a wave of shame and self-reproach washed over me; my palms went clammy and I felt this familiar, frustrated heat like I'm failing at even this. My reflexive response is to weaponize that feeling into problem-solving—inventorying causes and countermeasures—which drags me right back into analysis. I'm feeling overwhelmed and embarrassed about how fast I hijack it; can we slow down and do another guided, slow exhale together so I can try to stay with the body without turning it into a task?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame and self-reproach are showing up even as you tried to hold the sensation.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *while* I guide you through the exhale. On the count of 1, I'll say "inhale"... when you're ready, slowly exhale with me: "exhale... one..." *pause* As you exhale, I want you to notice the sensation in your body *before* you notice what's happening in your mind. Just *before* the wave of shame or frustration shows up, notice the sensation of your chest, the warmth under your sternum, the clamminess of your palms... *pause* Just for one second.

Patient: I caught the moment—there was a tiny slackening in my chest, warmth under my sternum, and the fabric of the armrest under my left hand. Then almost immediately a sharp wave of shame and frustrated heat washed over me; my palms went clammy, my breath shortened, and I felt like I'd already failed at even this. As usual my cognition reterritorialized the experience into a meta-strategy—inventorying causes, contingency plans—which yanks me back into analysis. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a little humiliated; can we slow down and do one very small guided step—cue me for a single slow exhale and then hold silence for three seconds so I have a chance to stay with the body without narrativizing?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the pattern of reterritorialization.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *just as I say* "exhale"... on the count of 1, slowly exhale with me: "exhale... one..." *pause* And then, I want you to hold *silence* for three seconds. Not to think, not to notice what's happening in your mind, but simply to be with the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or make sense of it.

Patient: I did it — when you said "exhale... one..." I let the air out slowly and held the silence for the three seconds. For a beat there was a small slackening in my chest, a warmth under my sternum, and the fabric under my left hand felt grounding, but almost immediately a wave of shame and that old frustrated heat flooded in; my palms went clammy and my mind started narrativizing it as another thing to fix. I'm not sure I follow how "just silence" prevents the cognition from reterritorializing the sensation — it feels like cognitive machinery reflexively converts any pause into another metric to optimize. Can we slow down and try one more, but this time cue the three silent seconds out loud so I have something external to anchor to?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how the silence might help, even if it doesn't prevent the cognitive machinery from kicking in.

Let's try again. When you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *just as I say* "exhale... one..." *pause* And then, I want you to hold *silence* for three seconds. Out loud, I'll say: "I'm holding silence for three seconds... with you." That way, there's something external to anchor to, and you can try to stay with the sensation in your body, even if your mind starts to wander.

Patient: Okay — I did it when you said the phrase: I exhaled and held the silence for the three seconds. For a beat there was that slight slackening and warmth under my sternum and the armrest felt grounding, but almost immediately shame and that frustrated heat flooded in, my palms went clammy, and my mind converted the pause into another thing to optimize. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit humiliated by how fast I hijack it — can we slow down and do one even smaller step, like you cue a single slow exhale and then give me five silent seconds with you verbally counting them so I have something external to latch onto?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try again, even with the familiar patterns showing up.

Let's try this: when you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your left hand touching the armrest *just as I say* "exhale..." and then I'll start counting slowly: "one... two... three... four... five..." *pause* I want you to hold onto that pause, with me, for those five seconds. Just notice the sensation in your body, without trying to change it or make sense of it, and let the counting be what keeps you anchored to the present moment.

Patient: I did it — you counted one through five and I exhaled and held the silence. For a very brief beat my chest loosened and the armrest felt grounding, then predictably my mind turned the pause into a metric to optimize—vagal tone, respiratory cadence—and shame and that queasy, frustrated heat flooded back; my palms went clammy and I felt like I was failing at even this. I'm embarrassed and annoyed with myself, and that frustration is coloring everything right now — can we slow down and try one more tiny step, with you cueing each second out loud and maybe anchoring me to the pressure of my feet on the floor instead of my hand?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing how the frustration is showing up and making it hard for you to move forward.

Let's try this: when you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor *just as I say* "one..." and then I'll count slowly: "one... two... three... four... five..." *pause* I want you to hold onto that sensation of your feet on the floor, with me, for those five seconds. Notice the pressure of your feet, the weight of your body, the sensation of the floor beneath you. Let that be what keeps you grounded, even if your mind starts to wander.

Patient: Okay — I can try that. When you said "one..." I noticed the pressure of my feet on the floor and, for a very brief beat, it felt grounding, but then a rush of shame and self-reproach hit and my brain immediately turned it into metrics and contingency plans. I'm feeling overwhelmed and a bit humiliated by how fast I hijack it — can we slow down and do one very slow guided five-count where you cue each second out loud and remind me to attend to weight rather than rates?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing how the shame and self-reproach are showing up, even as you try to focus on the pressure of your feet.

Let's try this: when you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor *just as I say* "one..." and then I'll count slowly: "one... two... three... four... five..." *pause* As you're counting, I want you to notice the *weight* of your feet on the floor, not the *rate* of your breathing. Can you allow the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor to be what matters, even if your mind starts to wander?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is focusing on the weight of my feet supposed to stop my mind from converting it into another metric? I can already feel that familiar flush of shame and frustration rising, my chest tightening and my palms going clammy, and then my brain immediately starts cataloging. I can try, but can you cue each second out loud and say "notice the weight" on each count, and can we slow down so I don't get pulled into analysis?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that focusing on the weight of your feet won't be enough to stop the mind's analysis.

Let's try this: when you're ready, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor *just as I say* "one..." and then I'll count slowly: "one... notice the weight..." *pause* "two... notice the weight..." *pause* "three... notice the weight..." *pause* "four... notice the weight..." *pause* "five... notice the weight..." *pause*

I want you to focus on saying "notice the weight" on each count, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Just repeat it to yourself, "notice the weight," over and over, as you're counting. That's it.

Patient: I did the sequence and repeated "notice the weight" with you — for a brief beat the pressure of my feet actually felt grounding and the chest loosened, but almost immediately my cognition reified the exercise into another performance metric and the shame/queasiness came flooding back. I'm embarrassed and irritated at how fast I hijack it, and I feel my hands go clammy and my breathing shallow again. Can we slow the pace way down and have you cue each count very slowly while reminding me to attend only to weight, and maybe give longer pauses so I have a chance to stay with the sensation without immediately analyzing it?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing how the performance metric is showing up, even as you try to focus on the weight of your feet.

Let's try this: I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor *just as I say* "one..." and then I'll count very slowly: "one... pause..." *pause* 1 second... *pause* When you're ready, I'll say "two..." and we'll continue.

I want you to focus on just noticing the weight of your feet on the floor, without trying to change it or make sense of it. Just be with the sensation of your feet pressing into the floor, without judgment. That's all.

Patient: Okay — I can try that, though I can already feel the familiar chest tightness and the urge to catalog everything. Please cue me slowly — say “one” and wait a long beat before “two,” and remind me each time to “notice the weight” so I don’t immediately turn it into a metric. I’m feeling a bit queasy and ashamed about how fast I hijack these moments, so can we go very slowly now?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: I'll wait until you're ready. When you're ready, I'll say "one" and we'll start. 

*(pause)*

Patient: Okay — I'm ready. I can already feel that familiar flush of shame and irritated frustration rising like it's saying I failed at this before, so please go very slowly and cue each count out loud, saying "notice the weight" on each number so I have something external to latch onto. I'll try to keep attention on the pressure of my feet; say "one" when you want to start.
