Patient: I've been stuck lately with this constant worry about my performance as a teacher — every lesson feels like a test and I end up procrastinating until it's almost too late. Grief and money worries don't help; they just make the whole thing heavier. I'm skeptical this will help though — how is talking about it supposed to change the pattern?

Therapist: When you say "this won't help," what might be holding that thought for you right now?

Patient: Mostly because I've tried similar things before and they didn't stick — breathing exercises, to-do lists, even a short CBT stint. With grading, meetings, bills, and the grief sitting there, the strategies feel impossible to keep up with; procrastination just wins. I'm also terrified of what'll happen if I slip up — losing my job isn't an abstract fear — so I end up freezing instead of acting. How is talking about it here supposed to change any of that?

Therapist: It sounds like trying new things hasn't worked for you before, and that feeling of "not being able to keep up" is really tight. When you mention being frozen by the fear of losing your job, what's the thought that shows up when you notice that fear — like, "If I let myself slip up, I'll lose my job"?

Patient: Yeah, that's exactly it — the thought is basically, "I'll mess up, they'll see I'm not good enough, and I'll lose my job." Then it slides into, "I can't afford that, so I have to be perfect," and that just freezes me. Honestly, I've named that before and it didn't help — how is just pointing it out supposed to change anything?

Therapist: Noticing that pattern again feels like a familiar struggle. What would it be like to notice that thought, "I'll mess up, they'll see I'm not good enough," while still sitting with the weight of needing to be perfect, and then *what* if, instead of pushing it away, you made room for that thought while doing the lesson anyway?

Patient: I can picture it — like saying to myself, "there's that thought" — but in the middle of a lesson it escalates: my hands shake, I lose the thread, students notice. Making room feels like I'm giving it permission to take over rather than helping me keep going. I've tried mindfulness before and it just made me more aware of the panic, so how is that supposed to help me actually teach without freezing?

Therapist: It sounds like making room for that thought while doing the lesson feels like letting it "win" again. When your hands shake and you lose the thread, what's one small thing you could still do with that lesson that matters to you — not despite the panic, but because of it?

Patient: Maybe I could do something small like ask the class to do five minutes of quiet writing or start a short, prepped group task — it buys me a moment to breathe and get my notes back in order without having to improvise. I suppose I could also, briefly and quietly, say I need a moment, but that feels risky — how is admitting that supposed to not hurt how others see me? I've tried pausing and breathing before and it just makes me notice the shaking more, so I'm skeptical, but a simple fallback that doesn't rely on me being calm in the moment might actually work.

Therapist: It sounds like taking a small step back, like asking the class to do writing, might help you regain some control. And when you think about briefly saying you need a moment, what would that moment actually look like for you, not as a "failure" in front of others, but as a way to keep showing up for them?

Patient: I guess it would look like me saying, "Give me a minute," putting on a short, prepped independent task (like a five-minute writing prompt), and using that time at my desk to breathe, scan my notes, and steady my voice — almost like a practiced pause, not a flustered excuse. Framing it as routine could let me keep showing up for the students without improvising through the panic, but I'm still wary — how is saying that out loud not going to make people think I'm slipping?

Therapist: It sounds like you're thinking about how others might perceive it, and that's a big part of what's holding you back. What if, instead of worrying about how others would react, you focused on what matters most to you in that moment — like, what would happen if you could still teach, still connect with your students, even if it felt like you were barely holding it together?

Patient: If I could still teach and connect even when I'm barely holding it together, I think I'd feel less like every class is a make-or-break exam and more like I'm actually helping the kids. But I'm worried colleagues or parents would interpret it as me falling apart — and how is imagining that supposed to stop them from thinking that? The five-minute writing fallback seems doable, but how do I make that stick so I don't keep freezing week after week?

Therapist: It sounds like the worry about what others think is still there, even when you're imagining yourself doing what matters most. What if, instead of trying to control how others think, you made room for that worry as one part of the whole thing — like it's just there, but you're not letting it stop you from teaching?

Patient: I get the idea of letting the worry be there without letting it stop me, but I'm not convinced — how is that supposed to stop me freezing? Naming it just makes it louder for me. Maybe if I paired that naming with the five-minute fallback and practiced it until it was automatic, it might help, but I don't know how to make 'practice' realistic with grading, meetings, and bills breathing down my neck.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to make it feel more real to you, so it doesn't feel like a luxury when you're already feeling overwhelmed. What if, instead of trying to "practice" it as something separate from your actual work, you started noticing it in the moment you feel the freeze coming on — like, what would it be like to do the five-minute writing task *right now*, even if it feels like it's not enough?

Patient: I can picture doing a five-minute writing right now — it's small enough that it doesn't feel impossible, like a tiny bandage. But honestly, how is that supposed to change months of freezing and the habit of procrastinating? If I were to try it, I'd need ready-made prompts and a simple cue to trigger it so it actually becomes automatic in a lesson instead of just another good intention — how would you help me set that up?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to make that tiny bandage stick in a way that feels more sustainable. What if, instead of trying to come up with perfect prompts or cues, we just started with what you do already know works for you in small moments — like taking a deep breath when you're feeling anxious, or making a cup of coffee when you need a boost?

Patient: Alright — concrete things that actually help me in small moments: making a cup of coffee before class steadies me, having a small stack of ready-made five-minute “bell work” prompts in a drawer stops me from improvising, and a sticky note on my desk that says “pause — set 5 min” can yank me out of autopilot. But I’ve done breathing and little tricks before and they haven’t lasted — how is this any different? If we pick one tiny routine (sticky note + one prompt + a timer) and make a plan for how I’ll use it in one class this week, I could try it — though I’m already feeling a bit overwhelmed, so can we slow down and actually figure out how to make it realistic with grading and meetings?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the familiar sense of overwhelm, but this time, you're willing to try something small with it. Let's focus on making that tiny routine a reality, one step at a time. What would it take for you to actually write down the sticky note, grab a prompt, and set the timer *before* the lesson, when you're still feeling the weight of grading and meetings looming?

Patient: I guess it would have to be nearly automatic — like putting the sticky note, one prompt, and a tiny timer in my bag the night before so it's grab-and-go in the morning. Maybe a three-item checklist on my phone that I do as I walk into school so it doesn't feel like extra thinking. But honestly, with grading and meetings and everything, I'm not sure how planning it the night before won't just become another half-done good intention — how is that supposed to make me actually follow through?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that planning it the night before will still feel like a "should," and that might lead to more stress. What if, instead of trying to "make it automatic," we focused on what matters most to you in that moment when you're standing in the classroom, and what small step you could take right then to make it feel more manageable?

Patient: Okay — if I'm standing in the classroom right then, I'd make it one simple motion: set my bag down, take a steadying sip of coffee as my cue, pull out the sticky note and a prompt, stick the note where I can see it, set a five-minute timer, and say, "Five minutes of quiet writing." That feels doable because it's a single chain of actions, not extra thinking in the middle of panic. But I don't trust myself to remember the cue when I'm stressed — how would you help me make that cue actually stick without it becoming another nagging "should"? I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed, so can we slow down and walk through exactly what that would look like step by step?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the familiar sense of "I'll do it when I can" creeping back in. Let's break it down even further. When you're standing in the classroom, what happens when you notice the stress creeping in — like your heart starts racing or your mind starts to freeze?

Patient: When it creeps in my heart speeds up, my hands get clammy, my voice tightens, and then my head just blanks — I lose the thread of what I was saying. The immediate thought is, “They’ll see I’m falling apart,” and I either rush through or hand out something prepared and hide behind it, which just feeds the later procrastination. I can already feel that familiar overwhelm — how is talking about these symptoms supposed to actually stop me from freezing? Can we slow down and walk through, step by step, what I’d do in that exact moment so it feels realistic?

Therapist: It sounds like you're already experiencing the exact thoughts and physical sensations you mentioned. Let's take that moment, right now, when your heart speeds up and your hands get clammy. What would happen if you simply noticed that sensation, without trying to change it or push it away?

Patient: If I just noticed it, two things happen: sometimes naming it loosens the grip enough that I can do the five-minute fallback, but more often it just makes the shaking and blanking louder and I freeze. I've tried the whole "notice and accept" thing before and it usually just magnified the panic — how is that supposed to help me actually teach in the moment? Can we slow down and map out the exact chain (coffee sip → sticky note → timer → say "five minutes") so noticing becomes a trigger for action instead of rumination?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sensation has a mixed effect for you. Let's focus on making the chain of actions feel more automatic. What if, when you notice the heart speeding up and hands getting clammy, you could simply *move your hand to grab the coffee cup*—not because you need the caffeine, but because that small action feels connected to what you want to do in that moment?

Patient: I can see how moving my hand to the coffee cup might break the loop—it's tactile and simple instead of spiraling in my head. But I'm worried I'll still blank and forget; can we slow down and actually walk through, step-by-step, how that cup-sip turns into pulling out the sticky note, setting the timer, and saying "five minutes" so it doesn't just become another half-done good intention?

Therapist: Let's break it down even further. When your hand reaches for the coffee cup, what happens next? *Does your mind start to wander or your body tense up, or does the action feel like a small, gentle movement?*

Patient: Usually it's a small, deliberate movement that can give me a tiny second to breathe — I lift the cup, take a sip, and for a moment I'm not inside the spiral. But more often my mind starts racing during the sip, my shoulders tighten, and I either forget the rest of the chain or I tell myself I don't have time and walk straight into the lesson. Can we slow down and actually map the exact next four steps after the sip (where the cup goes, how I grab the note, how I start the timer) so it's not just another idea that falls apart when I'm panicking?

Therapist: Let's map out those next four steps. *When you take the sip, what happens to the cup*—does it move to a specific place, like the counter or the desk, before you grab the sticky note?

Patient: I set the cup down on the right front corner of my desk — it's a consistent spot so the weight and placement feel like a little anchor. Then with my left hand I pull the prompt from the drawer/bag, stick the note on the top-left of my laptop (so it's in my line of sight), tap the five-minute timer on my phone/watch, and say, in a quiet voice, "Five minutes of quiet writing." 

But I keep worrying I'll blank halfway through or skip a move — how is rehearsing this actually going to stop that? I'm already feeling tangled, so can we slow down and walk through each tiny motion exactly (which hand, where the prompt lives, which button to press) so it feels doable in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that rehearsing will still lead to the same feelings of being "tangled." Let's focus on making the actual actions feel manageable, even if you still feel that way. *When you set the cup down on the desk, what happens to your body*—does your hand relax, your shoulders drop, or your mind quiet down for just a second?

Patient: When I set the cup down my hand relaxes and my shoulders drop a little — it gives a tiny gap from the spiral, but my mind usually keeps running the worst-case and I often forget the next move. Sometimes that pause is enough, but more often it isn't; how is that small relaxation supposed to stop me from freezing? Can we slow down and actually rehearse the exact motions (which hand does what, where the prompt lives, which button to press) so it feels real?

Therapist: Let's focus on making the next move feel like a choice, not a "should." *When you pull the prompt from the drawer, what happens to your hand*—does it move to the correct spot, like your left hand reaching for the prompt, or does your mind tell you to switch to your right hand?

Patient: My left hand usually reaches — it feels almost automatic: left into the drawer, fingers find the top prompt. But when panic hits my hands tense, I fumble or switch and the chain falls apart, so can we slow down and map each tiny motion (which corner of the drawer, exactly where on the laptop, which button to press)? I've rehearsed stuff before and it didn't stick — how is more mapping supposed to make it actually work this time?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to control the outcome instead of focusing on the process. Let's try to make the first step feel like a "what's my next move" moment, not a "make it perfect." *When your left hand reaches into the drawer to grab the prompt, what's the first thing you notice about the motion*—is it the feeling of your fingers reaching in, the sound of the drawer opening, or something else?

Patient: Mostly it's the feeling — my fingers brushing the edge of the prompt and the faint scrape when the drawer opens; that little tactile thing can ground me for a second. But as soon as I notice it my mind says “don’t fumble” and I can already feel the rest of the chain slipping away. I've tried noticing sensations before and it didn't stop the freeze — how is this supposed to help me actually follow through?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sensations has a familiar pattern of leading to more self-criticism. What if, instead of trying to "not fumble," you simply noticed the sensations *while* you were reaching for the prompt—without trying to change the outcome?

Patient: I can try noticing the scrape and the feel without trying to fix it, but I'm skeptical — every time I notice, my brain immediately says "don't fumble" and that just tightens everything. Maybe if we also rehearsed a fail-safe—like exactly what to do if my fingers fumble the prompt (which hand picks it up, where to put it next) — could we slow down and map that out step by step?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that noticing the sensations will still lead to the same "don't fumble" thought. Let's try to add that fail-safe to your list of steps, not to change the outcome, but to make the actual actions feel more manageable. *If your fingers fumble the prompt, what happens next*—does your left hand pick it up, and where does it go next?

Patient: If I fumble, my left hand would scoop it up — I tuck the prompt onto the right front corner of my desk next to the cup so it’s in my sight. Then my right hand peels a sticky to the top-left of my laptop, I slide the prompt under my left palm, use my right index to tap the five-minute timer on my phone (top-right corner of the screen), and quietly say, “Five minutes of quiet writing.” 

But I’m still worried my hands will shake and I’ll miss the timer or fumble again — how is mapping this out actually going to stop that? Can we slow down and rehearse exactly which finger presses the screen and what I do if I miss it so it feels realistic in the moment?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that the fail-safe will still lead to anxiety. Let's try to make the actual actions feel more automatic, not just by mapping out the steps, but by noticing what your fingers do when you're not thinking about it. *When you reach for the prompt, what's the first finger that touches the screen*—is it your right index, or something else?

Patient: Usually it's my right index finger — it's the one I instinctively use to tap the timer. But even knowing that, it trembles when I'm panicked and I worry I'll miss the press; how is rehearsing which finger helps if my hands just betray me? Can we slow down and actually walk through what I'd do if that finger slips?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that even knowing which finger to use won't help if it slips. Let's try to make the actual action feel more manageable, not just by knowing what to do, but by noticing what happens when you *do* use your right index finger. *If your right index finger slips and misses the press, what happens next*—does your left hand pick it up, or does your mind tell you to switch?

Patient: If my right index slips, my immediate thought is, “There — see, it’s falling apart,” and my hands go colder. Then my left hand would sweep in, grab the phone, and I’d try to press with my left thumb where it feels more stable (lower-right corner) — if that doesn’t work I’d use a small mechanical 5-minute timer in the desk I can twist with my palm so I don’t have to fiddle with the screen. But honestly, I’m not convinced rehearsing this will stop the shaking — can we actually walk through that exact motion very slowly so it feels real instead of just another idea?

Therapist: It sounds like rehearsing isn't just about knowing what to do, but about actually feeling the actions in your body. Let's try to break it down even further, so it feels like a tiny, manageable step. *When your right index finger slips, what's the very first thing that happens in your hand*—is it the feeling of your fingers relaxing, or the sensation of your thumb moving?

Patient: The first thing is my fingers clench a bit—index jerks back, thumb tucks in, and there's a tiny recoil like my hand's trying to protect itself; I notice that snap before I even think. My left hand usually moves in right after that to grab the phone or the desk timer. But honestly, how is just naming that going to stop it—can we actually slow down and walk through, very slowly, the exact palm-twist to the mechanical timer so it feels real?

Therapist: It sounds like naming the sensation isn't enough to stop the physical response. Let's try to focus on making the actual movement feel more deliberate. *As you notice your fingers clenching, what would happen if you allowed that small recoil to happen, and then made a tiny, tiny movement with your left hand to touch the desk timer*—not to grab it, just to make contact. What would that feel like?

Patient: If I let that little recoil happen and just brush the timer with my palm, it would feel quieter — a cool, solid touch that slows the rush for a second and lets my shoulders drop a fraction. But I keep thinking, I can imagine it now and still not do it in the moment — how is picturing the touch actually going to make my hand move when I'm panicking? Can we slow right down and actually walk through, step by step, the palm-twist on the mechanical timer so it feels real instead of just an idea?
