--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been struggling since the kids left — this adjustment stuff keeps rolling around in my head and I can't seem to shake it. I catch myself calling friends or unloading on family just to avoid sitting with the tough feelings, and it's starting to feel like numbing. I don't really expect therapy to fix it — I've tried talking and it doesn't work, so how is this supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really feeling stuck right now. Can you make room for that feeling of not knowing how therapy will help—without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try to make room for that feeling, but it feels pointless — when I sit with it my chest tightens and I start replaying things, and the first thing I do is call someone to get it off my chest. How is sitting with it supposed to help? I've tried doing that on my own and it just spirals into more worry.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It feels like when you try to make room for that tightness, it's not just about the tightness itself, but what you're trying to "get" from making room – feeling relief or avoiding the worry. What would it be like to notice the tightness, not because you're trying to change it, but because it's what shows up when you're trying to call a friend?

Patient: I can try, but when I notice it my chest gets tighter and my head fills with what-ifs and I end up rehearsing everything I want to tell someone. That just makes the urge to call louder — it doesn't calm it, it feeds it. So again, how is that supposed to help? I've sat with it before and it just spirals.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like when you notice the tightness and your mind starts racing with worries, it feels like you're getting pulled into a cycle you've been in before. What's one small thing you could do right now, even if it feels like just a tiny step, to take care of yourself while you're noticing that cycle—like taking a breath, or noticing your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay — I can put my hand on my chest and take three slow breaths and feel my feet on the floor. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried breathing before and it just makes me more aware and then I start rehearsing what I'll say to someone; I'll try it now and see if anything changes.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Before you try it, I want to check in with you: what matters most to you in this moment—what's the smallest thing that would feel like "helping" you, even if it doesn't solve the whole adjustment stuff?

Patient: What matters most is not losing it with someone — just getting through the next hour without calling and dumping on them. The smallest thing that would help is holding that urge for five minutes by taking slow breaths and feeling my feet; I'll try it, but seriously, how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that's what matters most to you right now.

Patient: It does matter — I did the three breaths and felt my chest ease a little, but my head just kept rehearsing what I'd say if I called. It helps for a minute, maybe, but then the urge comes back and I wonder what I'm supposed to do next. How is holding it for five minutes supposed to stop me from unloading later? I don't want to keep leaning on my sister like this, but I don't see a practical alternative.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like what matters most is finding a way to be with that urge for your sister—without trying to change it or get rid of it—so you can actually make space for connection with her when it matters. What would it be like to notice that urge as it comes back, not because you're trying to "fix" it, but because you care about being with your sister when she needs you?

Patient: I guess if I thought of the urge as protecting my sister rather than just getting relief for myself, it might give me something steadier to hold onto. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when the urge is loud and my head's rehearsing everything? I'm willing to try naming the urge as it comes, but I've done the "think of others" thing before and it usually doesn't stop the rehearsing.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto something specific—protecting your sister—when what shows up is just the urge. What if, instead of trying to make that specific thing happen, you could notice what's left when you let go of that idea?

Patient: I don't really know — when I try to let go of the idea of protecting her, there's this hollow feeling, maybe a tiny relief, then guilt that I'm not doing enough. Mostly I just slip into rehearsing apologies and explanations, which makes the urge louder, not quieter. I can try to notice what's left, but how is that supposed to be any different from getting lost in my head?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: That hollow feeling sounds really familiar. What if, instead of trying to fill it or make it go away, you could notice what's already here when you try to notice what's left?

Patient: Okay — when I try to notice what's left it's this hollow, tiredness and a low-level shame, like I'm not doing enough. I can feel it in my chest and shoulders, and there's that little voice that immediately starts scripting what I'll say to someone. But how is just noticing that supposed to stop the rehearsing? I've tried naming feelings before and it just makes me more aware and then I end up calling.


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like noticing that feeling of shame is actually what's driving the urge to call your sister—to make the pain go away. What if, instead of trying to make the pain go away, you could look at it for just a moment without trying to change it?

Patient: I can try to look at it for a moment, but when I do this shame wells up — it feels like that long-ago mistake and my chest tightens and I get this frantic urge to call someone to make it stop. How is just looking at it supposed to help? In my experience it just makes the rehearsing and the urge louder, but I'll try to hold it for a bit if you want me to.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that shame feels very connected to what matters most to you right now—protecting your sister. When you notice that shame, what happens if you could see it as part of what matters, not as the problem to be solved?

Patient: I can try to see the shame as part of what matters, but even saying that makes me feel exposed and angry at myself — the shame tightens my chest and there’s this instant urge to call someone to make it stop. How is recognizing it supposed to keep me from rehearsing and unloading? It usually just feeds the spiral. I’ll try to hold the shame as part of caring for my sister for a minute, but honestly I’m already frustrated and doubtful this will change anything.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto a pretty strong feeling—frustration—that's connected to not wanting to get stuck in this pattern. What if, just for a moment, you could notice that feeling without trying to change it, so you could see what matters about staying connected to your sister when she needs you?

Patient: I can try to notice it without trying to change it, but when I do the shame spikes — it feels like that old failure coming back, my chest tightens, and then I start rehearsing explanations. The urge to call becomes loud and frantic, and I wonder how sitting with it is supposed to stop me from unloading. I'm tired of trying things that only give me a minute before the spiral starts again.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're tired of the cycle. What if, instead of trying to make the cycle stop, you could just notice where it shows up for you right now—when the shame spikes and the urge to call becomes loud?

Patient: It shows up as this tightness in my chest and a hollow feeling low in my stomach, my hands get a bit clammy, and my brain goes straight into scripting everything I’d say—like an itch I have to scratch. I get angry with myself when that shame wells up and it just makes the urge louder. I can try to name it for a minute, but seriously, how is that supposed to stop me from rehearsing and dialing?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like naming the experience feels like a small act of kindness to you, but it's not enough to stop the urge to call. What if, instead of trying to make the urge stop, you could look at it as what matters most to you right now—staying connected to your sister when she needs you?

Patient: I can see how thinking of the urge as wanting to stay connected to my sister feels...kind of softer for a second, but then the shame spikes and I get frantic to call someone to make it stop. How is that supposed to help when the rehearsing starts—do I just keep telling myself it's about her until the urge fades? I'll try to notice the urge as "care" for a few minutes, but I'm doubtful, and if it doesn't ease, what do I do next?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if just noticing the urge as "care" for your sister will magically make it stop. What if, instead of trying to make the urge stop, you could notice what's left when you let go of trying to control it?

Patient: I can try to notice what's left when I stop trying to control it, but the minute I do this hot shame wells up and my head fills with scripts — it feels like I'm just handing myself over to a spiral. How is that supposed to help me actually resist calling? I'll try to notice for a minute, but I'm skeptical it'll do anything but lead to rehearsing.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what's left when you stop trying to control it feels like you're just moving from one problem to another. What if, instead of trying to control the shame or the scripts, you could look at what matters most to you right now—staying connected to your sister when she needs you—without trying to fix it?

Patient: I can try to look at it that way, but when I do the shame spikes — my chest tightens and I get frantic, and then the scripts start and the urge to call gets louder. How is noticing "what matters" supposed to be any different from the other things I've tried that just made the rehearsing worse? I'll try to notice it as care for my sister for a minute, but I'm already doubtful and annoyed that this probably won't stop me from dialing.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're doubting that noticing "what matters" will be any different because it feels like you're just going through the same motions again. What if, instead of trying to notice what matters or control the shame, you could just be with the feeling of doubt and annoyance right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay, I’ll try to sit with the doubt and annoyance, but already my shame spikes, my chest tightens, and the scripts start—then I get that frantic urge to call someone. How is that supposed to help me actually not unload on my sister? I’m tired and annoyed that these things only ever seem to buy me a minute before the spiral starts.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and tired of the cycle. When the shame spikes, what would it be like to notice it without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: If I try to notice the shame without pushing it away, it pulls me right back into that old mistake — my chest tightens, I get shaky, and my head starts rehearsing everything I’d say to make it stop. Sometimes naming it makes it a little less sharp for a breath or two, but more often it just turns the urge to call into a roar. How is that supposed to help me actually resist dialing?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like naming the shame is what matters to you right now—when it pulls you back into the old mistake. What if, instead of trying to resist the urge to call, you could notice what matters about staying connected to your sister when she needs you, even when the shame is pulling you away?

Patient: I get what you're saying about noticing what matters, but when the shame hits I get this hot, tight knot and everything goes frantic — calling feels like the only relief. How is telling myself it's about my sister supposed to quiet that urgent itch to unload? I'll try to notice it as care for her, but honestly I'm doubtful — if that doesn't work in the moment, what concrete step do you want me to try next?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the shame knot feels like it needs to be "fixed" right now, and calling feels like the only way to make that knot go away. What if, instead of trying to quiet the knot with the thought about your sister, you could notice what happens when you take a small step away from the knot, even if it's just for a breath?

Patient: Alright — I'll try a small step: one slow breath and feel my feet. I did it and it eased for a second, but then that shame — like that old failure — wells up, my chest tightens, and my head starts scripting, and the urge to call gets louder, not quieter. How is a breath supposed to actually stop me from dialing? I'm frustrated and doubtful — if that only buys me a minute, what concrete step do you want me to try next?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like taking that small step with your breath didn't quite yield the relief you were hoping for. What if, instead of trying to make the urge to call stop, you could notice what happens when you make room for the shame to be there, even when it feels like it's getting louder?

Patient: I can try to make room, but when I do that shame just gets louder — my chest tightens, I get hot and shaky, and my head immediately starts scripting apologies like it's replaying that old failure. Making room often feels like handing myself over to the spiral; I've done it before and it just turned the volume up. I'll try to notice it for a minute, but honestly — after I sit with it, what am I supposed to do next? Because usually it doesn't fade on its own.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like making room for the shame feels like a way to "get" it, but it doesn't actually help you do what matters most to you. What if, instead of trying to make room for the shame, you could notice what happens when you're already doing what matters to you, even when the shame shows up?

Patient: When I'm actually trying to be there for her the shame still creeps in and makes me feel exposed and worthless, and then I panic and want to call someone to make it stop. How is noticing what's left when I'm doing what matters supposed to keep that panic from turning into dialing? I'll try to notice it next time, but I'm frustrated and skeptical—this feels like another thing that might only buy me a minute before I spiral.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if noticing what's left when you're doing what matters will actually keep the panic from taking over. What if, instead of trying to notice what's left when you're doing what matters, you could notice what matters when the panic shows up?

Patient: I guess what matters when the panic shows up is not unloading on my sister — being present for her, not using her as my emotional bandaid. But when that panic hits it feels exactly like that old failure and I get hot, shaky, and frantic to call; saying "this matters" in my head doesn't feel like it changes the urge. How is noticing that supposed to help me actually hold the line? I'll try to name it next time the panic starts, but I'm already irritated and ashamed that this keeps happening — if that doesn't work, what concrete step do you want me to try?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing what matters when the panic shows up doesn't feel like it's changing the urge to unloading on your sister. What if, instead of trying to notice what matters or change the urge, you could focus on what you're actually doing when you hold the line—like taking a deep breath, or noticing your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay, I can try focusing on what I'm doing—take a deep breath and feel my feet—but honestly it usually only helps for a breath or two. The shame from that screw-up wells up, my chest tightens, and my head immediately starts scripting apologies, and the urge to call gets louder, not quieter. How is noticing my feet supposed to actually stop me from dialing later, and if that doesn't work, what's the concrete next step you want me to try in the moment?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if noticing your feet is going to magically stop the urge to dial later. What if, instead of trying to stop the urge to dial, you could focus on what happens when you pick up the phone—what would it be like to make that call, not to talk to your sister, but to just say "hello"?

Patient: Just saying "hello" sounds like it would feel hollow and exposed — I can already feel my chest tighten thinking about it, like I'm about to apologize for being a burden. How is that supposed to help when every time I open my mouth it turns into rehearsing and then unloading? I suppose I could try a very short hello and hang up, but I'm doubtful it'll stop the spiral once I start talking.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like even the small act of saying "hello" feels like it's going to trigger the same pattern of rehearsing and unloading. What if, instead of trying to control the conversation, you could focus on what matters most to you about being connected to your sister—what would it be like to just be with her, even if it feels hard?

Patient: Being with her would mean actually listening and not turning her into my sounding board — that's what I want, but when I'm there that shame wells up and I get hot, shaky, and frantic to unload. How is just “being with her” supposed to stop that; every time I try it the scripts start and I end up apologizing or dumping. I’ll try to stay present, but honestly I’m already tense and doubtful — if that doesn’t work, what concrete thing do you want me to do next?
