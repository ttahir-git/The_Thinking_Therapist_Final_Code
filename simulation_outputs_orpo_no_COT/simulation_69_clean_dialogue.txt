Patient: I'm an older manager and lately I've been getting intense anxiety in social settings, so I've been avoiding gatherings with friends and even family. It leaves me feeling isolated and a bit ridiculous, but honestly I'm skeptical therapy will help — I've tried things before and they didn't work. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like trying therapy before feels like a gamble, and that's understandable when you're not sure what to expect. Can you tell me what happens in those moments when you're trying to imagine doing something with others, like having dinner with a friend, but the anxiety shows up and makes that thought feel impossible?

Patient: When I picture a dinner with a friend my chest tightens, my stomach knots, and my head starts racing with all the ways I could embarrass myself or run out of things to say. I find myself mentally rehearsing exits, thinking of excuses, and by the time I finish the scenario I’ve decided not to go. I’ve tried to talk myself out of it before and it doesn’t stick — how is talking about this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to talk yourself out of the anxiety, it doesn't seem to make it go away. That makes sense. When you notice that mental rehearsal of exits happening, what would it be like if, for just a moment, you could see that thought without trying to change it? Like, "There's that worry about embarrassment again" – what would that look like, without trying to push it away?

Patient: I guess if I could just notice the thought it feels a bit like stepping back—watching a play instead of being on stage. Mostly though, when I try that, my chest still tightens and I get sucked right back into the spiral; naming it "that's embarrassment" helps for a second but then it feels the same. How is that supposed to help when I'm actually there with people — it just feels fragile.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the thought doesn't make the tightness in your chest go away, and that's okay. When you mention it feels fragile, what's important to you about being with friends and family right now? What matters most about those connections for you?

Patient: Mostly I don't want to feel completely alone — since the kids left I notice how much I miss the easy company, and I worry about drifting away from people who actually know me. I also care about not being a burden or looking foolish, so I hold back even though I know those connections keep me grounded. But honestly, how is talking about what matters supposed to help when I still freeze up at the door?

Therapist: It sounds like being alone feels like a bigger loss than the anxiety, and that matters a lot to you. When you think about what matters most – not feeling alone, being with people who know you – what would it be like to take that feeling of connection with you, even when the anxiety shows up? Like, what if you could hold onto that sense of being seen by your friends and family, not despite the anxiety, but because of it?

Patient: I can picture holding that sense of connection—like a little light I could carry—but when the anxiety hits my chest tightens and that light feels too small to keep me from bolting. It sounds nice in theory, but I don't see how "carrying a feeling" stops the rehearsing or the urge to make excuses. How is that supposed to help when I'm already halfway to the door?

Therapist: It sounds like carrying that light still feels like it might not be enough to stop the rest of the anxiety. What if, instead of trying to carry the light, you could make room for it right where you are, with the anxiety already happening? Like, what if you could notice the light even when the chest is tight – not because you're trying to fix it, but because you're already with it, even if it's hard to stay?

Patient: I can sort of picture trying to notice that little light while my chest tightens—like I'm splitting my attention—but in the moment it just feels fragile and short-lived. The rehearsing and exit-planning still take over; I've tried similar "noticing" exercises before and they don't stick. How is that supposed to help me actually sit through a dinner without bolting?

Therapist: It sounds like the noticing exercise feels fragile and doesn't stick even when you're trying to focus on it. What if, instead of trying to notice the light, you could try making room for the entire feeling – the light and the tightness – without trying to change it? Like, what if you could say to yourself, "I'm not trying to notice the light, I'm just making room for the whole thing – the light and the tightness – so that I can actually be here with my friends"?

Patient: I can picture making room for the whole thing, but when I try it feels like surrendering to the panic — my mind just keeps rehearsing exits and I'm halfway to the door before I know it. I've tried that kind of thing before and it doesn't stick; it's too vague and feels like one more thing to fail at. How is that supposed to help me actually sit through dinner — can you give me a concrete step I could try in the moment that won't just turn into another exercise I bail on?

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of making room for the whole thing feels like it's slipping away from you when it matters most. What if, instead of trying to change it, you could just focus on taking one small step towards sitting with your friends? Like, what if you could say to yourself, "I'm going to sit down at the table, even if I'm still feeling really anxious. I'll just put my hands on the table and look around the room – what do I see?" That's it – just putting your hands on the table and looking around the room.

Patient: Alright—I'll try it. I put my hands on the table and look around: the wood grain, a mug with a chip, the light over the sink, and my hands feel a little steadier, but my chest is still tight and my head's ticking off exit plans. Okay, fine—it's a small pause, but how is that supposed to stop me from bolting when someone asks a question or the conversation lulls?

Therapist: It sounds like the pause is small, but it's still small enough to make it hard to keep going. What if, instead of trying to make it bigger, you could just notice what happens when you stay with that small pause? Like, what if you could say to yourself, "I'm not trying to make this pause bigger, I'm just noticing what happens when I stay with it – like, how my chest feels when I look at the wood grain"?

Patient: I try to stay with the pause, and it actually eases my chest for a breath or two, but my head's still ticking off exit plans the moment the conversation shifts. Then someone asks a question or there's a lull and I'm already picturing the door. I get that noticing helps for a second—how is that supposed to help when I'm put on the spot? Can you give me a concrete thing to do right then that doesn’t just turn into another exercise I bail on?

Therapist: It sounds like the pause is helpful, but it's not lasting. What if, when someone asks a question or the conversation shifts, you could just say "uh-huh" – that's it – without trying to think of an answer or planning an exit. Just say "uh-huh" and look at the person asking the question.

Patient: Saying "uh-huh" sounds too simple — when that wave of shame hits and that old voice starts up, "uh-huh" would feel hollow and I'd still be plotting my escape. How is that supposed to help when I'm on the spot and everyone's looking at me? I can try to keep it short and just nod or say it, but I'm worried it'll feel fake and I'll bolt anyway — it feels like one more thing I'm failing at.

Therapist: It sounds like the simplicity of "uh-huh" feels like it wouldn't be enough to make it through the moment. What if, when that wave of shame hits, you could just lean forward a little bit – not to answer the question, just to be closer to the person asking it? Like, you could say "uh-huh" and then lean forward, just a tiny bit, without trying to control it.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — lean forward? That sounds odd to me. When that wave hits it drags up this familiar shame and I feel exposed, like whatever I did wrong is on display, and that knot just tightens. Saying "uh‑huh" and leaning feels like another little trick I'll fail at; my face goes hot and I'm already picturing the door. How is that supposed to help when I'm flooded and everyone seems to be looking right at me?

Therapist: It sounds like the idea of leaning forward feels like it would be one more thing to push away the shame. What if, when that wave hits, you could just notice the knot in your chest – not to try to make it go away, but just to notice it – and then say "uh-huh" and lean forward without trying to control it? Like, what if the knot was just a sensation that showed up, and you could say "uh-huh" and lean forward even if it felt like your face was on fire?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is noticing the knot and saying "uh‑huh" and leaning forward supposed to help when that old shame flares up and my face goes hot? It just feels like another little trick I'm going to fail at; I can try to mumble something, but I'm afraid it'll sound fake and I'll still be halfway to the door. I'm frustrated and honestly tired of trying things that don't stick.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated. What if, instead of trying to do something to make the shame go away, you could just let it be there for a moment – not to change it, but just to notice it. Like, what if you could say "I'm feeling really frustrated and scared right now" – not to try to make it better, but just to notice that it's what's showing up for you.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm frustrated and scared" just makes me feel exposed and brings up a lot of shame. I can try to say it out loud, but it feels like admitting I failed before and then I'm already picturing the door. How is that supposed to help when the hot flush and racing thoughts have already started?

Therapist: It sounds like saying "I'm frustrated and scared" might not be what you're looking for. What if, when the shame and frustration come up, you could just pause for a moment before you react? Like, what if you could say "I'm not sure what to say" or "I don't know what to do right now" – not to try to fix it, but just to give yourself a tiny bit of space to breathe?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — saying "I'm not sure what to say" just feels like admitting I'm useless, and that makes this old knot tighten. I can try it, but that just brings the shame up and I'm already picturing the door. How is that supposed to help when I'm flushed and everyone's looking at me?

Therapist: It sounds like the thought "I'm not sure what to say" is actually making the knot tighter. What if, when you feel that knot, you could just notice what's making it tighter – not the thought itself, but what's happening in your body when you think that? Like, what's the physical sensation of that knot, and what's it telling you?

Patient: It feels like a heavy lump under my ribs, my breaths get shallow, my hands tingle, and my face goes hot — like my body's already packing to leave. That knot tells me I'm exposed, that I'll say something dumb or be judged, that I'm a failure for even being there, and I get this wash of shame that drags me toward the door. I can try to notice that, but I'm frustrated and tired of it — how is noticing that supposed to stop me from bolting when it feels like proof I shouldn't be there?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the knot and the shame is actually making you feel more anxious about being there. What if, instead of trying to notice the knot or push it away, you could just look at what's happening right now – what you can see, hear, and feel in this moment? Not to change it, but just to notice it as it is. Like, what's one thing you can see right now that doesn't involve the knot or the shame?

Patient: I can see the chipped mug on the counter and the afternoon light on the floorboards — and my hands are still tingling from that knot under my ribs. I'm not sure I follow how naming the mug helps when that old shame's humming away in the background and I'm already picturing the door — how is that supposed to stop me from bolting?

Therapist: It sounds like naming the mug isn't quite doing what you need it to do. What if, instead of focusing on what's "helping" – the mug, the light, the knot – you could try to make room for the knot itself, just for a moment? Not to change it, but just to notice it as it is, without trying to push it away or fix it. Like, what would happen if you simply allowed that knot to be there, without trying to change it – just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "allowing" the knot just feels like surrender, and that old shame rushes back like I'm admitting I can't handle it. My face goes hot, my hands tingle, and before I know it I'm picturing the door. How is just letting it be supposed to keep me from bolting? I'm tired of these little tricks that sound nice and disappear when it matters.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and frustrated. What if, instead of trying to "allow" the knot, you could try to notice what's actually happening when you feel like surrendering? Like, what's the thought that shows up when you say "I'm admitting I can't handle it"? Not to change it, but just to notice it – what's the story that's behind that thought?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — the thought that shows up is basically, "They'll think I'm pathetic or useless; I'll say something stupid and they'll see I don't belong." The story behind it is that I've already messed up before, so why would anyone stick around for more of the same? That shame just washes over me and I want out. How is just noticing that supposed to stop my face going hot and me heading for the door? I'm tired of trying things that sound reasonable and then failing at them when it matters.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really disconnected from what matters to you right now. What if, instead of trying to notice the thought or the shame, you could try to notice what would actually be worth showing up for – what would make it worth being there for your friends, even if it feels hard? Like, what matters most to you about this gathering – not about avoiding the shame, but about being present for the people who matter to you?

Patient: I guess what matters is not losing the people who actually knew me — the quiet company and not feeling completely alone. But when I'm there that old shame floods back, I feel exposed and like I'll say something stupid and everyone will see I'm a failure, and then I get so anxious I can't think. My hands are jittery and my mind keeps jumping to exits; I can't even settle on the thought. How is that supposed to help me actually go and stay?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame is really tied to the fear of losing the people you care about. What if, instead of trying to avoid that shame, you could try to notice what would happen if you did stay – not because you're brave, but because it feels important to you. Like, what would it mean to you if you showed up for your friends, even if it feels scary? Not to change anything, but just to notice what matters to you about that.

Patient: I guess if I stayed it would mean I wasn't letting that shame shove me out of my life — I'd keep the people who know me and maybe prove to myself I can still be part of things. But right now my chest tightens just picturing it, my hands are jittery, and the thought slips away before I can hold it. How is that supposed to help me actually stay when the hot flush and exit plans start? I need something concrete to do in the moment that won't just feel like another thing I'll fail at.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to stay present with that thought, even when it feels hard. What if, instead of trying to change the thought, you could try to notice what your body is doing when it tightens up – not to try to fix it, but just to notice it? Like, what does it feel like when your chest tightens, and what happens in your body when your hands get jittery? Sometimes, noticing what's happening in the body can help us feel more connected to what matters, even when it's hard.

Patient: It feels like a heavy pressure under my breastbone, my breaths get tiny and fast, my shoulders tense up, and my hands go cold and start trembling — I fiddle with whatever's near me. My mind floods with old failures and shame and everything gets louder, and I'm distracted right now so it all spirals faster toward the door. I can try to notice that, but how is just paying attention to the tightness supposed to stop me from bolting when it feels like proof I don't belong?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the physical sensations is actually helping you feel more connected to what's happening in your body. What if, instead of trying to change the sensations or the thoughts, you could try to make room for the fact that you're feeling this way – not because it's good or bad, but because it's what's showing up for you right now? Like, what would it mean to you to be with this feeling, even if it's hard? Not to fix it, but just to notice that it's what matters to you right now.

Patient: I can imagine trying to be with the feeling, but right now that old shame is washing over me — my hands are trembling, my face goes hot, and I'm all over the place. I'm really not convinced that “noticing” alone will keep me from bolting; it just feels like more evidence I don't belong. I'm tired of little exercises that vanish when it matters — can you give me one single, concrete thing I can do in the moment (one sentence to say or one tiny action for 10 seconds) that won't just feel like another thing I'll fail at?

Therapist: Can you make room for just 10 seconds to notice what's happening right now – even if it feels like the shame is about to overwhelm you – by simply saying "I'm here" to yourself?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. "I'm here." Saying it out loud makes the words feel thin the moment that familiar flash of failure and shame shows up, and my chest clamps down and my hands start shaking. I can't stop picturing getting up and leaving — how is that supposed to help when the flash drowns the words? If that's the one-sentence, give me one concrete 10-second action I can actually do in the moment that won't just turn into another thing I bail on.

Therapist: Can you put your hands down on the table and make room for the shaking for just 10 seconds – not to stop it, but to notice that you're sitting there with it?

Patient: Okay — my hands are on the table. My fingers are trembling, my chest is tight, and this ugly rush of shame comes on like always, so my mind's already halfway to the door. How is that supposed to help when the shaking and the thoughts don't stop — give me one concrete, 10‑second thing to do right now that won't just feel like another trick I bail on.

Therapist: Can you breathe in through your nose for just 10 seconds, feeling the air move into your chest – not to calm the shaking or the shame, but just to notice that you're breathing?

Patient: Okay — I'll try. (Breathes in) I'm breathing in through my nose, but a sudden wave of shame and frustration hits and my chest's still tight and my hands are shaking. I'm doing it, but how is just noticing my breath supposed to stop me from bolting when I'm already halfway to the door?

Therapist: Let's try something even smaller. Can you notice the sensation of your feet touching the floor for just 10 seconds – just that feeling of your feet being there, without trying to change it or let it go?

Patient: Okay — my feet are on the floor, I can feel the carpet under my toes and the weight on my heels, but a flash of that old shame just washes over me and my chest tightens. I'm not sure I follow how noticing that for ten seconds is supposed to stop me from bolting — it just feels like another little trick I'm going to fail at.
