Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really stuck and directionless lately — my identity feels wrapped up in being a data scientist, and with the job instability it's like everything else is hazy. I'm burned out and restless, and I don't know what actually matters beyond the role. I get that therapy's supposed to help, but how is that supposed to help me figure this out?

Therapist: It sounds like the uncertainty is really showing up for you right now. When you mention feeling stuck and directionless, what's one thing about that feeling that's already present for you – not just the "I don't know what matters," but the physical sensations or thoughts that come up when you try to imagine moving forward without the data science role?

Patient: Yeah — physically it feels like this heavy pressure in my chest and a knot in my stomach, and my thoughts either spin with worst-case scenarios or go totally blank. Emotionally I get restless and snappy, like I'm moving through mud and every step takes too much energy. I've noticed this before and tried naming it, so... how is talking about sensations actually supposed to help me figure out what to do next?

Therapist: It seems like that physical pressure and knot in your stomach are really connected to the uncertainty about your identity and job. When you notice those sensations, what would happen if you simply acknowledged them – like, "This knot is here" – without trying to change them or push through them?

Patient: If I said "this knot is here," I might notice it for a second and maybe it loosens a bit, but most of the time it just gets louder and my brain lurches into worst-case mode. I've tried the "sit with it" approach before — it feels passive and kind of useless when what I want is a plan or a way out. How is that supposed to help me actually get unstuck or figure out what matters besides my job?

Therapist: It sounds like when you say "I want a plan or a way out," that knot gets even tighter. When you say "this knot is here," what would it take for you to notice that knot just for 5 more breaths – not to solve it, but just to notice it – while you start to wonder, "What would matter to me if I wasn't trying to solve the knot?"

Patient: Alright, fine — I’ll try. I take five slow breaths and I can feel the tightness in my chest and the knot in my stomach; it’s there and it doesn’t disappear, even as my mind jumps to worst-case scenarios. But honestly, how is noticing that supposed to help me actually decide what matters or make a plan to get unstuck?

Therapist: When you notice the knot, what if you could see it as a sign that you're holding onto something important – even if it feels like it's holding you back? For example, what would happen to that knot if you could make room for the thought "I value my safety" or "I care about my well-being"?

Patient: If I try to make room for "I value my safety," the knot actually tightens — it feels like admitting why I cling to the job, like I'm choosing comfort over anything else, and that brings up shame. Maybe naming it would slightly ease the panic because it gives the fear a reason, but it still doesn't tell me what to do next. How is that supposed to turn into an actual plan? Give me a concrete, tiny action that would both honor safety and move me out of this stuck place.

Therapist: When you say that making room for "I value my safety" brings up shame, what if that shame wasn't something to be avoided – but something to notice while you're still holding onto that knot? What if, just for a moment, you could say "I'm feeling shame right now" *while* you're making room for "I value my safety"?

Patient: I can try saying it — "I'm feeling shame" while holding "I value my safety" — and it feels like admitting I'm choosing comfort, which stings and makes the knot worse. Maybe it dulls the panic for a second, but then I just get stuck thinking about consequences. How is that supposed to turn into a concrete next step? Give me a tiny action that respects that need for safety but actually moves me forward.

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to "fix" the knot, you could notice that "I'm feeling shame" shows up when you think "I'm choosing comfort" – and then what would happen if you simply acknowledged that thought *while* you made room for "I value my safety"?

Patient: Okay — if I try that, it does take the edge off for a moment: the panic backs down a notch but the shame shoots up and then my brain starts rehearsing consequences again. A tiny action that feels like it might actually respect safety and nudge me forward? Spend 20 minutes tonight scanning LinkedIn or my old projects, not to apply, just to jot three things I liked doing and one skill I’d enjoy using in a non-committal way — low risk, concrete, and keeps momentum. But honestly, I’ve done list exercises before and they end up feeling performative; how is this actually any different or going to stick?

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if that tiny action feels like a "check" or "to-do" – like, you're still trying to "get something done" instead of just noticing what matters. What if, instead of trying to make the list feel "performative," you could try to notice what would happen if you did it *without* trying to make it "count" or "matter" – just to see if it feels different?

Patient: Fine — I’ll try it just to see what happens. I’ll set a 20-minute timer tonight and jot three things I liked doing and one skill I’d enjoy using, with no pressure to make it mean anything. But seriously, how is doing it casually supposed to show me what actually matters, not just what used to be a job task?

Therapist: What if, instead of trying to figure out what matters, you simply noticed what happens in your body while you're doing that 20-minute scan – what sensations arise, what thoughts come up, what emotions show up – without trying to change them or make sense of them?

Patient: Alright — I’ll try, though this feels like a lot to even start. I’ll set the 20-minute timer and quietly notice the chest tightness, the knot in my stomach, the blank spots and the looping worst-case thoughts without trying to fix them, but honestly, how is that supposed to turn into an actual plan?

Therapist: What if, after those 20 minutes, you didn't need to "plan" anything – what if you simply noticed what showed up for you in that quiet time, and what mattered to you about taking small steps towards your values *while* holding onto safety?

Patient: Okay — I’ll try the 20 minutes and just notice what comes up, but honestly it feels like pulling teeth; my head’s foggy and everything feels heavy. I’ve done this noticing stuff before and it usually just leaves me more stuck, so how is that supposed to turn into anything concrete I can actually use? I’ll do it tonight, but I’m not expecting miracles.

Therapist: What if, when the fog is there and the heaviness is real, you didn't have to "do" anything new – just notice that you're noticing the fog and the heaviness *right now*, while you're holding onto the timer and the quiet time?

Patient: Okay — I can try noticing that I'm noticing the fog and the heaviness while I hold the timer, though it already feels like a lot just to start. When I do that, my chest tightens and my head kind of blanks out, so I'm not convinced it's different from spiraling. If I'm going to sit with it, give me one tiny concrete thing to do right after the 20 minutes so it doesn't just dissolve into more fog.

Therapist: What if, when the fog shows up and the chest tightens, you simply *write down* one small, ordinary thing that matters to you – like "I like making tea" or "I value my friend's call" – without trying to make it mean anything or change it?

Patient: Okay. I can try writing one ordinary thing — I'll put down "I like making tea." It feels kind of small and a bit silly, and I'm already braced to dismiss it. How is that actually supposed to stop me from spiraling afterward or turn into something that helps me move forward?

Therapist: What if, instead of judging the smallness or silliness of "I like making tea," you simply *allowed* it to be there – even if it felt like a tiny, insignificant thing – and then *put it down* on paper *without* trying to make sense of it or change it?

Patient: Alright — I’ll let it be and write “I like making tea.” It feels tiny and kind of pointless, but I’m doing it. Now give me one tiny concrete thing to do right after writing it so it doesn’t just dissolve into spiraling — how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What if, right after writing "I like making tea", you *put the pen down and look around the room* – just to notice what's there, not to do anything with it, but just to notice it – and then get up and make yourself a cup of tea *while* holding onto that small, ordinary thought?

Patient: Okay — I’ll do it: put the pen down, look around, make tea while holding “I like making tea.” It already feels like effort and kinda pointless, though. How is that supposed to stop the spiral afterward — give me one tiny thing to do right after the first sip so it actually anchors me.

Therapist: What if, after the first sip of tea, you simply *tasted it* – not to change it or make sense of it, but just to notice the sensation of the liquid on your tongue – and then *spoke the word* "tea" out loud, just one more time?

Patient: Okay. I take a slow sip, notice the taste and warmth, and say "tea" out loud — it gives a tiny pause, like the knot loosens a notch. But it feels fragile, like it'll evaporate any minute; how is that supposed to stop me from spiraling? What’s one concrete thing to do right now after that sip so it actually sticks?

Therapist: What if, when the knot loosens a notch, you *touched the edge of the cup* with your finger – just to notice the sensation of your hand and the weight of the cup in your hand, not to change anything, but just to notice it – and then *stayed there for a breath* while holding onto the thought "I like making tea"?

Patient: I touch the cup and hold that breath — it eases a tiny bit, but it already feels fragile and like it could snap back. Give me one very concrete thing I can do right now after that breath to actually anchor it — not another "notice," like something I can do from this chair (send a one-line text? set a 2‑minute timer?), because vague stuff just loops me back.

Therapist: What if you *open your phone to your notes app and type "tea" with your finger* – just to make it concrete and physical, not to change anything, and then *stop there*?

Patient: Fine — I open Notes, type "tea" with my finger, and stop. It's stupidly small but there's a sliver of pause — and I'm already bracing for it to evaporate. What's one concrete thing I can do right now from this chair that isn't just another "notice" so it actually sticks?

Therapist: What if you *make yourself a piece of toast* – just to do something small and tangible, not to solve anything, and then sit with the thought "I like making tea" while you wait for it to pop up in the toaster?

Patient: Alright — I’ll make the toast. It already feels like effort, but I’ll do it. After the first bite, give me one very concrete thing to do from here that actually anchors it — like send a one-line text to a friend ("thinking of you") — though honestly, how is that supposed to help?

Therapist: What if you *call your mom* – just to make a small, ordinary phone call, not to change anything, and then sit with the thought "I like making tea" while she answers?

Patient: Calling my mom feels like too much right now. I’ll send a one-line text instead — “Thinking of you.” …Okay, sent. It took effort and already feels fragile. How is that supposed to keep this tiny pause from evaporating into the same old spiral?

Therapist: What if, while holding onto that text to your mom, you *look at the clock* – just to notice the time, not to do anything with it, but to notice that the pause is happening in the present moment, not just in your head?

Patient: I look at the clock — the pause is real for a second, like it's actually happening now — but it already feels like it's fading. How is noticing the time supposed to keep this from unraveling, and what's one concrete thing I can do right now from this chair so it doesn't just evaporate?

Therapist: What if you *write "pause" on the same note you sent to your mom* – just to make it concrete and physical, not to change anything, and then leave it there?

Patient: Okay — I wrote "pause" in the note next to the text. It feels like a tiny, fragile anchor and I'm already braced for it to fade — so if the spiral comes back in five minutes, what's one concrete thing I can do from this chair that actually shifts me out of it?

Therapist: What if, when the spiral comes back – which it might – you *stand up and walk to the kitchen* – not to make tea or do anything with it, but just to move your body and create some space between your thoughts?

Patient: Okay. I can try standing up and walking to the kitchen — it sounds small but even that feels like a lot. How is that supposed to actually break the spiral? I’ve paced before and the thoughts just follow me. If I can’t get up or it doesn’t help, what’s one tiny thing I can do from this chair that might actually shift it?

Therapist: What if, when the spiral comes back – which it might – you *tuck your feet under the chair* – just to anchor yourself to the seat, not to change anything, and then notice what's left of the pause while you wait for the thoughts to come back?

Patient: Okay — I tuck my feet under the chair. It actually grounds me a little, the knot eases a notch, but it's fragile and I'm already bracing for it to snap back — how is that supposed to stop the spiral? If it doesn't work, give me one specific fallback I can do from this chair right now (not just "notice") — like a 30‑second paced breath with my hand on my chest or something concrete.

Therapist: What if, when the knot comes back – which it might – you *put your hand on your chest and take 5 slow breaths* – not to change anything, but just to notice the sensation of your hand and the breath while you wait for the thoughts to come back?

Patient: Okay — I put my hand on my chest and took five slow breaths; it eased the knot a tiny bit but it already feels fragile and like it could snap back. Fine — tell me one very concrete fallback I can do from this chair if that doesn't keep the spiral away, because I'm not convinced this'll stick.

Therapist: What if, when the knot comes back – which it might – you *make yourself a cup of tea and hold the cup in your hand* – just to do something small and tangible, not to change anything, and see what happens when you sit with it while holding the cup?

Patient: Okay—I'll make the tea and hold the cup. It already feels like effort and like a fragile pause, so how is that actually supposed to stop the spiral long-term? If it doesn't work, give me one very concrete fallback I can do from this chair right now.

Therapist: What if, when the spiral comes back – which it might – you *let go of the tea cup and just sit with the thought "I'm here" in your seat – not to change anything, but just to be with it, even if it's hard?

Patient: Okay — I let go of the cup and sit with "I'm here." It eases the knot for a breath or two but feels like a thin thread I'm waiting to see snap. If that unravels, give me one very concrete fallback I can do right here in the chair that actually breaks the spiral — not just another "notice."
