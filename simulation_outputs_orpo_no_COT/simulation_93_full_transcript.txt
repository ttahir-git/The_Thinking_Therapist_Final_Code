--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I keep getting stuck in this loop of harshly criticizing myself over what I see as failures — even tiny ones — and I think it traces back to being bullied at school, which wrecked my social confidence. It's showing up at work and with friends; I joke a lot to cover it, but inside I feel like an idiot sometimes. I’m skeptical this will help though — how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When you notice that criticizing self feels connected to being bullied at school, what happens in your body when you imagine *not* having that story – like the feeling of "I'm an idiot" – being there, but just for a moment?

Patient: When I imagine that the "I'm an idiot" story just... isn't there for a moment, there's this weird lightness in my chest — like a small knot loosens and my breathing eases a bit. Then disbelief creeps in and my stomach flips, like my brain's already hunting for proof that it's a trick, and the tension snaps back. Honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried picturing being okay before and it vanishes fast or I get distracted and start doubting again.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That knot loosening feels like it matters, even if it's fleeting. When you notice the disbelief and stomach flip, what happens if you gently allowed that knot *while* the doubt is there, without trying to chase it away?

Patient: When I try that, at first the knot actually gets louder — my heart picks up, I get hot and my thoughts start racing with, “This is fake, it won’t last.” But if I stay with it for a breath or two the tightness sometimes softens and I can kind of watch the “I’m an idiot” thought instead of feeling swallowed by it. Still, it’s hard to stay; my brain immediately wants to distract or jump to the worst, so… how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like staying with the knot for just a breath or two matters, even if it feels hard. What's the value in that knot – what might happen if you didn't *change* it, but just *saw* it there, while you notice the worth of being with it?

Patient: I guess the value might be that the knot stops feeling like proof about me and starts feeling like a reaction I can notice — if I can see it, it loses some of its punch. That could mean I get a split-second of choice instead of automatically apologizing or deflecting with a joke at work or with friends. But it's scary — it feels like inviting the bully back in, and I keep thinking, “How is that supposed to help?” I'm trying to see how this connects, but I'm struggling; can you walk me through what staying with it actually looks like without everything blowing up?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Let's break it down a tiny bit. When you notice the knot and the "I'm an idiot" thought, what would happen if you simply *saw* the knot there – not as proof, but just as a physical sensation in your chest – while you're already doing your job, or hanging out with friends?

Patient: Sometimes it actually helps — I notice the tightness and can keep talking or finish the email without blurting an apology, and that small pause feels like a win. But more often my attention dives into the knot, I go quiet or make a joke to cover it, and the “I’m an idiot” loop snaps back louder. How is that supposed to help? I’m trying to see how this connects, but I’m struggling — can you give a simple, real-world example of doing that in the middle of a work conversation?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Let's try a small example. Imagine you're in a meeting, and someone asks for your opinion on a project. As they're speaking, you feel a knot in your chest and the thought "I'm not good enough" starts to show up. But instead of immediately jumping into "I'm sorry, I don't know what to say," you notice the knot there – you feel it in your chest, like a small weight. And you choose to keep talking, saying "That's an interesting idea, I'd like to hear more about how that would work..." What happens when you stay with the knot, just for a moment, while you're still speaking?

Patient: When I stay with the knot while talking, sometimes I can keep going — my voice stays steady and I actually add something useful — but it still feels like walking a tightrope, like everyone can see I'm faking it and my chest stays tense. Other times I freeze or crack a self-deprecating joke and the knot clamps down harder. How is that supposed to help long-term? Can you give me a concrete, tiny thing I can say or do in that moment so I don't bail?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're doing a lot of work just to keep showing up. What if, when you feel that knot and the thought "I'm not good enough" showing up, you made a tiny choice to keep speaking – just for one more word – without trying to change it?

Patient: I can imagine trying that — forcing myself to say just one more word, like “and…” or “also…,” to buy a beat. When I do it, my chest sometimes eases and I can finish the thought without apologizing, but a lot of the time my brain still panics and I bail or make a joke. How is that supposed to help long-term? Give me a super-tiny, concrete phrase I can actually practice in a meeting so I don’t have to think about it in the moment.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Let's try a tiny phrase that might help. When you feel that knot and the thought "I'm not good enough" showing up in a meeting, you can say to yourself: "I'm here." Just those two words. No thinking about it, no trying to change it – just saying "I'm here." What if you said that right now, right in the meeting, and just kept talking?

Patient: If I actually said "I'm here" to myself in that moment, the knot would sometimes ease enough for me to add another sentence instead of apologizing — it's like buying a beat. But it still feels fragile and fake, and my brain yells, "They'll notice you're bluffing" — how is that supposed to help long-term? Can we actually role-play a sudden call-on-me scenario so I can practice using it without freezing?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Let's practice a scenario. Imagine you're at work and your boss asks you a question that makes you feel stuck. You take a deep breath, and as you do, you say to yourself: "I'm here." What happens when you say that, and then your boss asks the question?

Patient: Usually if I actually say "I'm here" to myself, the knot loosens enough that I can spit out a line like, "I think we could try..." and the meeting keeps moving. But a lot of the time my brain yells they're going to see I'm bluffing and I either stammer or make a self-deprecating joke and sink. Can we do the role-play now — ask me the boss question so I can try using "I'm here" in real time? Also, honestly, how is that supposed to help when it still feels so fake?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: Let's do the role-play. Imagine your boss asks you: "What do you think we should do about this project to get it back on track?" 

As you hear the question, take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I'm here." Then, try to respond in a way that feels connected to what you're saying, like "I think we could try..." What happens when you say that, and your boss responds?

Patient: Okay — I take a breath, whisper "I'm here" to myself, and I force out, "I think we could try tightening the timeline, reassigning two tasks to the product team, and run a checkpoint next week." For a beat my voice actually holds and my boss says, "Can you sketch that out now?" and my chest spikes — I either stumble for specifics and say "I'll follow up" (which feels like bailing) or I manage to quickly name one concrete step and it lands. Half the time I still freeze or crack a joke and ruin it. Can we do the role-play again with you pushing for details so I can try actually staying with it, because honestly — how is that supposed to help if I keep buckling?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: Let's try again. Imagine your boss asks you: "What do you think we should do about this project to get it back on track?" 

As you hear the question, take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I'm here." Then, try to respond in a way that feels connected to what you're saying. You mention tightening the timeline and reassigning tasks – what's one specific action you could take to make that happen?

Patient: Okay — one concrete thing I could do right after the meeting is send a short follow-up email the same day: a one‑page plan that names three specific tasks, assigns each task to a person, and gives each a clear deadline (e.g., Product rework — Alex — by Friday; QA check — Priya — by Monday; checkpoint meeting — Wed at 10am). Saying it now makes my chest tighten and my mind starts racing with, “What if they think it’s not enough?” — honestly, how is that supposed to help? Can you push me like my boss would and ask, “Who exactly owns the rework and what’s the first step?” so I can try answering without freezing?


--- Turn 11 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 11]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: Let's try it. Imagine your boss asks you: "Who exactly owns the rework and what's the first step to making that happen?" 

As you hear the question, take a deep breath and say to yourself: "I'm here." Then, try to answer without overthinking it. What's one person who's responsible for the rework, and what's the very first concrete step you can take to make that happen?

Patient: I breathe, whisper "I'm here." Alex should own the rework. First step: send Alex a very short email right after the meeting asking them to take ownership and to send a one‑page plan (3 tasks, owners, deadlines) by Friday. My chest's already tight just thinking about it — but I can try to hit send. How is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: Now, imagine your boss asks you: "Why not send that email right now? What would that take to make it happen?"

Patient: I could do it — it’s basically five minutes: open a new email, subject line, three bullets naming Alex as owner, the tasks and deadlines, ask for the one‑page plan by Friday, and hit send. But the second I think about actually sending it my chest tightens and I start telling myself they’ll call it half‑assed — how is that supposed to help? I can try to draft it now, though... I'm just kind of worn out.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Let's try drafting it. *silence* Just take that first step: open a new email. What happens when you click "compose"?

Patient: I click compose and the blank page suddenly feels huge — I get a subject in and start, "Alex — can you own the rework and…" then my chest spikes and I immediately backspace half of it. My mind jumps to, "They'll think it's half‑assed," and I drift to another tab instead. I can try again, but it's a lot right now — can you give me a one‑line opener I can paste so I don't overthink?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *no guidance*

Patient: Fine — I’ll paste one I can actually use:

Subject: Rework ownership
Body: Alex — can you own the rework and send a one‑page plan (3 tasks, owners, deadlines) by Friday? Thanks.

I can try to hit send, but my chest’s already spiking and I keep thinking they’ll call it half‑assed — how is that supposed to help? Can you push me like a boss would to actually send it right now?


--- Turn 15 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 15]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: *no "push"*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — you won't push me, but I kind of need something concrete. My chest's spiking, the draft is copied, and I'm either going to hit send or leave it open and get distracted. Do you want me to actually send that one‑liner now, or help me tweak it so it doesn't feel so half‑assed? And honestly, how is just sending this supposed to help with the whole shame loop — I'm skeptical it does much.


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: I'll help you tweak it. What if, instead of saying "half‑assed," you could rephrase it to "help me make sure I'm doing this right" or "make sure I'm giving Alex enough support"?

Patient: Okay… maybe try this:

Subject: Rework ownership
Body: Alex — can you own the rework and send a one‑page plan (3 tasks, owners, deadlines) by Friday? Let me know what support you need from me.

I can paste that, but my chest’s already tight and I’m itching to bail — can you just tell me to hit send? And honestly, how is wording this differently supposed to help with the whole shame loop — I still feel like they’ll think it’s needy or half‑assed.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: I'll tell you to hit send. *pauses* Take a deep breath and paste the email.

Patient: Subject: Rework ownership
Body: Alex — can you own the rework and send a one‑page plan (3 tasks, owners, deadlines) by Friday? Let me know what support you need from me. Thanks.

Okay — it's pasted. My chest is spiking and my hands feel shaky. Please tell me to hit send now. And honestly, how is this supposed to help with the shame loop when I still feel like they'll think it's half‑assed?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Hit send.

Patient: Okay — I hit send. My hands were shaking and my chest's still spiking; now I'm already imagining they'll call it half‑assed and I want to yank it back. How is that supposed to help with the shame loop? Can you stay with me while I sit with this for a moment?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *no judgment* You're sitting with the shame loop, and it feels really tough. What would it take for you to stay with it for just one more moment, without trying to fix it or change it?

Patient: I can try, but it's hard — my chest's tight and my brain already wants to bail or make a joke. If you could guide me with a couple slow breaths or just stay quiet for twenty seconds, I might manage to hold it without fixing it. But honestly, how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *no guidance*

Patient: Alright… I’ll try to stay. Can you actually guide me through two slow breaths—inhale, exhale—so I don’t start scrambling? My chest’s tight and I keep thinking “they’ll call it half‑assed” — how is that supposed to help?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Inhale... *pause* for a second... and exhale... *pause* for a second... What's the thought that shows up *right after* you exhale?

Patient: Right after I exhale the thought that sneaks in is, "They're going to think it's half‑assed," and right behind that is, "I'm going to be exposed as a fraud." My chest tightens and I have this urge to delete the email. I can try to stay with it for a few more breaths, but honestly — how is that supposed to help? Can you stay with me while I hold it?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *no reaction*

Patient: I'm trying to stay with it, but the silence just makes the "they'll think it's half‑assed" voice louder — my chest's pinched and I keep wanting to hit delete. Can you tell me what you're noticing or just say "I'm with you" so I don't spiral? And honestly, how is that supposed to help beyond this tiny moment?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *I'm noticing that you're trying to hold the thought without acting on it*

Patient: Okay… hearing you notice that does take the edge off a little, but my chest is still tight and the urge to delete is loud. Can you actually say "I'm with you" or name one small thing you see so I don't spiral? And honestly — how is just noticing supposed to help beyond this ten‑second pause?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *I'm with you*

Patient: Okay… hearing "I'm with you" actually takes the edge off a bit — my chest eased a notch and I didn't immediately delete it. Still, that "they'll think it's half‑assed" voice is loud. How is that supposed to help beyond this pause? Can you name one concrete fact I can hold onto right now so I don't spiral?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *The fact that you hit send*

Patient: Okay... I did hit send — hearing you say that actually eases the chest a notch. But the "they'll think it's half‑assed" voice is still yelling and I'm this close to deleting — how is that supposed to help beyond the fact itself? Can you stay with me and name one more concrete thing I can hold onto right now, or guide me through a few slow breaths so I don't yank it back?
