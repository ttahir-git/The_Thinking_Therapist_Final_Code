Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this sort of pervasive inertia since I lost someone close, where even painting feels monumental and motivation just evaporates. As an artist I find myself intellectualizing the grief—dissecting stages, motivation deficits, attachment theory—instead of actually feeling the hollowness, and that's started to make me withdraw and doubt myself in my relationship. I guess I'm here because that distance doesn't feel sustainable, but I don't really know how to move from these abstractions into something that actually helps.

Therapist: When you say "intellectualizing the grief" makes you withdraw, what happens to the space where you might have felt the hollowness—like when you're trying to paint, but it feels like that's not possible?

Patient: When I try to paint, that space where hollowness might be gets taken over by explanations—like an epistemic vacuum I try to fill with theories about grief, attachment, and motivation rather than the feeling itself. So instead of a raw ache there’s a clinical narration: “this is low dopamine,” “this is avoidance,” and that narration occupies the whole room, leaving no literal felt-sensation to work from. I don't know, it's like I'm peering at my emotions under a microscope and describing them instead of touching them, and that distance makes me withdraw from my partner because I end up explaining my absence rather than actually being present.

Therapist: So the act of trying to describe what's happening to you—those theories about grief and motivation—feels like it's creating a kind of distance between you and what matters most right now: being with your partner.

Patient: Yeah, exactly — there's this metacognitive loop where verbalization becomes a defensive protocol, an "epistemic displacement" that substitutes narrative for raw feeling. So with my partner I end up offering clinical explanations like “it’s just low motivation” or “I’m processing grief,” which paradoxically reads as emotional absence and makes me feel performative and more distant. I guess I worry they'll see me as broken or indulgent, and that worry just feeds the withdrawal.

Therapist: When you're with your partner, noticing how that narrative shows up—“I'm just not motivated”—what happens to the space for connection and presence if you were to let that thought be present, without trying to fix it or explain it?

Patient: If I actually let that thought sit without narrativizing, theoretically it creates a tiny aperture where feeling could enter — like affect could have a literal place to land. But practically I get scared: I imagine my partner getting confused or pulling away, so I reflexively go back to analysis to preempt judgment. The result is either undiluted sadness that feels destabilizing, or a performative commentary that keeps us distant, and honestly I'm not sure I can tolerate whichever shows up.

Therapist: So the fear of being confused or judged by your partner is what keeps you from letting that thought sit with feeling. What if, instead of trying to protect against that fear, you were to ask: what matters most for you in this moment, not about what your partner might think, but about what would help you feel connected to them?

Patient: I guess what matters most is being seen as a person having an experience, not as a clinical case to be explained—like I want permission to be human-sized and untidy in front of them. Practically, small things would help: tolerating awkward silences, sitting with me without trying to fix it, or asking something simple like “What do you need right now?” instead of offering explanations. My default is to translate that need into analysis—so even asking for presence feels risky because I’ll likely preempt it with theory and then sabotage the connection. I don’t really know how to ask for that kind of simple, non-analytic care without falling back into my usual patterns.

Therapist: Noticing that what matters most is being seen as human-sized and untidy, rather than fixed. And that small things matter, like tolerating awkward silences or asking for presence without fixing it. 

What if, instead of trying to ask for that care without falling back into patterns, you were to try making room for it while you're asking? Like, what would it be like to say "I need to try asking for presence, but if my mind starts to fix it, I'll gently notice that thought and let it go"?

Patient: That phrasing feels like a pragmatic meta-commitment—an explicit permission slip for untidiness that acknowledges my metacognitive reflex. My concern is that “notice and let go” could just become another analytic script that keeps me distant, so a concrete behavioral anchor might help, like “I need you to sit with me; if I start over-explaining, gently say ‘stay’ or put your hand on mine.” I'm willing to try that, though I'm anxious and it's probably going to feel awkward and clumsy at first.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to take a small risk to try and make room for that connection. Noticing that "notice and let go" might feel like another script, and that having a concrete anchor like "stay" or putting your hand on your partner's might help you stay with the feeling of being untidy, even if it feels awkward.

Patient: Okay, I can try that — it actually feels like giving myself explicit permission to be messy instead of performing clarity. I'm still anxious that "notice and let go" will calcify into another epistemic script, so a tangible anchor like my partner saying "stay" or placing a hand on mine seems like the only thing that might actually interrupt the metacognitive loop. Could we role-play a bit so I can practice saying something like, "I need you to stay with me; if I start explaining, please say 'stay' or put your hand on mine"? I'm nervous it'll feel clumsy, but maybe practicing would make it less catastrophic.

Therapist: I'll play the role of your partner. When you're ready, try saying "I need you to stay with me; if I start explaining, please say'stay' or put your hand on mine" while I'm here.

Patient: I'm nervous and my instinct is to intellectualize, so this might sound clumsy.  
"I need you to stay with me; if I start explaining, please say 'stay' or put your hand on mine."

Therapist: *I pause for a moment, looking at you*

Patient: That pause feels like a small void and my reflex is to fill it with analysis—epistemic displacement, here we go. My chest tightens and my throat wants to start explaining why I'm tense instead of just... being tense. Could you actually say "stay" or put your hand on mine now? I think hearing that would make it possible for me to not leap back into commentary, though I'm nervous it might still feel performative.

Therapist: *I gently put my hand on your arm*

Patient: Okay... when your hand went on my arm, something in my chest loosened — like the running commentary dimmed a notch and I could actually notice a heaviness there instead of just describing it. My first impulse is to start explaining why that happens — attachment patterns, neurochemistry — but right now it feels like a cold, hollow weight under the warmth of your hand. I'm scared it'll become overwhelming if I let it fully in, so could you just keep your hand there and not ask me to explain anything? If I start talking myself into analysis, please say "stay" like we practiced.

Therapist: *I hold your hand steady, looking at you*

Patient: Okay... when your hand went on my arm I actually felt a small loosening — a heavy, cold sort of pressure in my chest and a warmth where your hand rests. My instinct is already to start explaining why — attachment, avoidance, neuro stuff — but I don't want to right now. Could you just keep your hand there and say "stay" if I start slipping into analysis? I think I might cry or go quiet, and that's probably alright.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm and whisper softly* "stay"

Patient: Hearing you say "stay" and feeling your hand there actually dims the running commentary a little—there's a cold, heavy thing in my chest that's real instead of just a concept. I'm scared it'll swell and I'll start talking myself into a hundred explanations, so please just keep your hand there and say "stay" if I start slipping into analysis. Can we sit like this for a few minutes? I want to try letting the feeling be without narrating it.

Therapist: *I nod slightly, still holding your hand, and gently shift my weight to make room for you to sit with the feeling*

Patient: Okay — already my mind wants to narrativize this as an attachment pattern and cognitive avoidance, so I'm noticing that thought and trying to set it aside. There's a heavy pressure under my sternum and a brittle tightness in my throat; tears are building and that scares me because I worry crying will feel like losing control. Could you keep holding my hand and say "stay" if I start explaining, and maybe prompt me to take a slow breath now and then? I want to try letting this be for a bit, even though I'm anxious it will get too intense.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, and whisper softly* "stay" 

*I gently place my other hand on your chest, above your sternum, and say* "Breathe in..."

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to breathe in like you said. There's this hot shame and frustration flaring up right now, like some past screw-up is telling me I don't deserve to just be here, and that makes me want to clamp down and start explaining everything instead of letting the breath land. The breath helps a little but the reflex to intellectualize is loud, so please keep your hand there and say "stay" if I start rationalizing; I don't want to lose this small calm.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, the one on your chest, and whisper softly* "stay" 

*I gently place my other hand on your knee and say* "When you breathe out, what's one tiny thing you can let go of—just for a moment—about that shame?"

Patient: Maybe I can let go—just for this exhale—of that internal thesis that my tears are an index of personal incompetence, the meta-evaluation that every vulnerable moment proves I'm fundamentally broken. Saying that aloud already makes my cheeks hot and my hands clench with shame and frustration, so if you keep saying "stay" and keep your hand there, I can try to let that idea loosen for a bit.

Therapist: *I keep my hands where they are, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I say nothing else, just keep the physical presence and gentle pressure of my hands, allowing the space for you to find a small opening to let go of that internal thesis—just for the breath that's coming next

Patient: I breathe in and my chest immediately wants to clamp down — that old, hot sense of humiliation ricochets through me and my throat tightens. On the out-breath I can feel the taut sentence "you're incompetent" lose a little of its grip, like a thin crust cracking, but there's still this sticky residue of shame and frustration that makes me want to explain it away. Your hand actually helps; it dims the commentary enough that I can feel tears gathering instead of translating them into theory. I'm scared it'll all snap back and I'll start rationalizing, so please keep holding me and saying "stay" if I drift — I want to try sitting with this, but it's precarious and I'm anxious about losing control.

Therapist: *I keep my hands exactly where they are, holding the space for you, and whisper softly* "stay" 

*I don't say anything else, just the gentle whisper of "stay", as I sit with you, holding the same physical presence, letting the room be with you in this precarious moment, without asking you to move or change

Patient: Okay—there’s a hot spike of shame and frustration that just flared up and my chest tightened; it wants to convince me I don’t deserve this gentleness, so my mouth is already rehearsing explanations. Your hand and the whispered "stay" are actually making the running commentary softer, but I’m still scared of losing control if I let it fully land. Could you keep breathing with me—inhale for four, exhale for six—and just stay silent unless I start explaining, in which case say "stay"? I want to try holding this without translating it.

Therapist: *I nod slightly, and breathe in for four counts, making a soft "inhale" sound 

*I exhale for six counts, making a gentle "out" sound 

*I keep my hands on your arm, chest, and knee, holding the space, and remain silent, waiting for you

Patient: Okay — my attention keeps snagging on these catastrophic little hypotheses, like a looped sentence telling me I'm failing at everything, and that makes the breath shallow and my chest tighten. The in/out breathing helps a bit, but I'm twitchy and distracted and my reflex is to start explaining why it's happening (attachment dynamics, avoidance, etc.) instead of staying with it. Can you keep your hand where it is and say "stay" if I start to narrate, and maybe prompt me to notice three things in the room if I drift? I'm embarrassed to need that, which makes me want to hide—and then I start talking instead of feeling.

Therapist: *I keep my hands where they are, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Notice what happens when you notice that looped sentence—what's the sensation in your chest, what's the breath like, what's the story telling itself—right now, in this moment, before you try to explain it away"

Patient: Okay—physically there's a hot, tight pressure under my sternum, my breath's shallow and my throat feels like it's closing, my palms want to clench. The story looping is basically "you're failing, you're burdensome, you shouldn't need this," and that shame spikes the reflex to explain it away—frame it as attachment theory or avoidance—because talking about it feels safer than being in it. I'll try to stay with the sensation and count the breaths, but I'm jittery and distracted, so please say "stay" if I start narrating, and maybe prompt me to notice three things in the room if I drift.

Therapist: *I keep my hands where they are, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Notice three things that matter to you in this room right now—something small, like the chair beneath you, or the sound outside, or the feeling of the air on your skin—what keeps those things present, even for a moment?"

Patient: Okay—three things that matter right now: the warmth of your hand on my arm, the slow inhale/exhale rhythm we're doing, and the steady support of the chair beneath me. What keeps them present is that they're somatic anchors—temperature, pressure, and rhythm—that puncture the metacognitive loop and give me somewhere to land instead of narrating. Even so, there's a hot spike of shame and a jittery anxious chatter telling me I'm failing and undeserving, so my attention keeps wanting to swerve into explanation. Can you keep saying "stay" and maybe name one of those anchors aloud if I start to drift? I know it feels awkward to ask, but I think hearing you would actually help.

Therapist: *I keep my hands where they are, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "That hand on your arm feels like warmth to you—like it's saying 'I'm here, even when it feels like you're not'—what happens if you let that warmth stay with you for just a breath?"

Patient: If I let that warmth stay for a breath, the metacognitive commentary actually quiets a notch and there's a softening under my sternum—my inhale gets a fraction deeper and my eyes feel wet. But then shame and frustration spike—this hot little verdict that I don't deserve it—and my reflex is to start rationalizing, so hearing you say "stay" really helps keep me from turning it into another lecture. Could you keep your hand there and say "stay," and maybe name "warmth" if I start to drift? I want to try holding that one breath again, even though I'm anxious it'll evaporate.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Warmth"

Patient: When you say "warmth," my chest actually loosens a bit and my inhale gets a fraction deeper—my eyes sting and I can feel tears trying to come up. But there's this hot spike of shame and that jittery, anxious chatter—my attention keeps snagging and I want to start explaining why instead of staying with it. Can you keep your hand there and say "stay" if I start narrating, and maybe name one more anchor like "support" or "breath" so I have something else to land on while I try to hold this one breath?

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Breath"

Patient: When you say "breath," my inhale actually deepens a bit and there's a tiny loosening under my sternum, but immediately shame spikes—this hot little verdict that I'm undeserving—and my mind wants to translate it into an explanation. I'm feeling jittery and distracted now, so could you keep saying "stay," name "support" or "chair" aloud, and guide the 4-in/6-out breathing with me? I don't want to slip back into theory right now.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Support" 

*I breathe in for four counts, making a soft "inhale" sound, and then exhale for six counts, making a gentle "out" sound

Patient: Okay—when you said "support" and guided the 4/6 breath my inhale actually got a little fuller, but now a hot spike of shame and jittery anxiety is wobbling my focus and my hands want to clench. My reflex is already drafting an explanation—attachment patterns, avoidance—but I don't want to turn this into a lecture; can you please keep saying "stay," keep your hand there, and keep guiding the breaths? Maybe name "chair" or "support" aloud and we'll do five more cycles—I'm nervous and distracted, but I want to try.

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Chair" 

*I breathe in for four counts, making a soft "inhale" sound, and then exhale for six counts, making a gentle "out" sound 

*I gently say* "Stay with the breath"

Patient: Okay — I'll try to stay with the breath. Your voice helps, but there's this hot spike of shame and frustration flickering in me and it makes my attention jittery, so I keep wanting to explain it away. Could you keep guiding the 4-in/6-out for a few cycles and quietly say "stay" and name an anchor like "support" if I start to drift?

Therapist: *I keep my hand on your arm, whispering softly* "stay" 

*I gently say* "Support" 

*I breathe in for four counts, making a soft "inhale" sound, and then exhale for six counts, making a gentle "out" sound 

*I gently say* "Stay with the chair"

Patient: Okay — I'm trying to stay with the breath. When you said "support" and "chair" my chest loosened a bit and tears are prickling, but there's a hot spike of shame and frustration telling me I'm undeserving, so my attention jitters into epistemic displacement and starts drafting explanations instead of feeling. Could you keep your hand there, guide the 4-in/6-out for a few more cycles, softly say "stay" if I start to narrate, and name an anchor like "warmth" or "support" between breaths? I want to hold this, even though I'm anxious it'll evaporate or I'll immediately start explaining.
