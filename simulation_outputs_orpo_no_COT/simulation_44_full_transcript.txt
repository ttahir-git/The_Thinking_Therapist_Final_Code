--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been ruminating about my performance at work — I'm a nurse and every shift feels like a high-stakes evaluation where any oversight could be catastrophic. That anticipatory anxiety leads me to procrastinate on charting, study, or follow-ups, which then creates this paradoxical, self-reinforcing feedback loop tied to an old health scare and lingering PTSD symptoms. I usually try to stay upbeat and analytical about it, but I guess that analysis is also a way of keeping some distance from the actual fear underneath.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're caught between trying to protect yourself from the anxiety that might come with making a mistake, while also needing to do your job effectively. When you say that analysis is a way of keeping distance from the actual fear underneath, what happens if you could notice that fear just for a moment, like a faint whisper in the background, while you're still working on those charts?

Patient: If I noticed the fear, I’d probably immediately frame it as an interoceptive cue of hypervigilance—like my trauma circuitry flagging potential risk—and try to bracket it so I can keep functioning. In reality that bracketed noticing contracts my attention: my heart spikes, I get tunnel vision, then to avoid the sense of incompetence I over-check things and end up procrastinating on the very charts I need to finish. I know that sounds a bit clinical, but honestly I feel stuck and kind of unsure how to let it be without it snowballing.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the act of noticing that fear actually tightens your body and creates a cycle of avoidance, which in turn makes it harder to do your job. When you say "I feel stuck and kind of unsure how to let it be," what would happen if you could imagine making room for that fear to be present, without needing to control it or fix it right away?

Patient: If I actually made room for the fear, theoretically it could desensitize the autonomic alarm and reduce the compulsion to over-check—so I might get charts done without that loop. But in practice, imagining that feels risky: it’s like opening a little door and worrying the whole place will flood, so my attention fragments and I end up procrastinating anyway. I’m curious about trying it, but also kind of anxious about what would happen if noticing the fear actually made me feel less competent on shift.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the thought of making room for that fear feels like it could be catastrophic, like the whole system would collapse if you let it be present. What if, instead of trying to control what happens when you notice the fear, you could try noticing what matters to you when you're working on those charts—like "I want to do a good job for my patients" or "I want to feel competent in this moment"?

Patient: That actually makes sense conceptually — orienting to values could act as an attentional anchor that competes with the threat signal — but in practice my mind promptly rebrands those values as imperatives, like moralized "shoulds," which then ratchets up the pressure and my avoidance. I'm curious to try it, though; maybe a tiny, nonjudgmental prompt — something like "What would be helpful right now for this patient?" instead of "You must do this perfectly" — would feel less triggering.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: That's a great small step. When you say "a tiny, nonjudgmental prompt," what if that prompt could actually be a tiny door to notice what matters for the patient, even if it doesn't solve the problem of your anxiety?

Patient: Conceptually, yeah — a tiny, nonjudgmental prompt could act as an attentional anchor, a sort of salience recalibration that pulls me toward the patient's immediate needs instead of my catastrophic loop. Practically, my appraisal system tends to moralize those prompts into "shoulds," which then spikes anxiety and paradoxically fuels procrastination. I'm willing to try a micro-script like "What's one helpful thing for this patient in the next five minutes?" but I'm anxious it’ll just turn into another checklist I over-scrutinize.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're close to seeing how that tiny prompt could actually be a small step toward noticing what matters for the patient, even if it feels like it's being hijacked by your appraisal system. What if, when you notice that "should" creeping in, you could say to yourself "That's not what I'm aiming for here" – not to dismiss it, but to make room for the tiny prompt to stay present?

Patient: That's an interesting micro-defusion move—relabeling the "should" as a misaligned imperative could decouple the moralized appraisal from the attentional anchor. Pragmatically I'm skeptical: my default is to meta-analyze the tactic until it becomes another criterion, so "That's not what I'm aiming for here" might just calcify into yet another judged standard. I'm willing to try it—can we role-play a quick example so I can see how it lands in my body instead of just my head?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: Let's try a quick example. Imagine you're working on that chart, and you notice the "should" creeping in as you think "I need to do this perfectly." What if, just for a tiny moment, you said to yourself "That's what my mind is saying, but what's one helpful thing I could do for this patient in the next five minutes – not because I'm doing it right, but because it matters to them?"

Patient: Okay — I actually tried it in my head: “That’s what my mind is saying, but what’s one helpful thing I could do for this patient in the next five minutes?” Cognitively it briefly decoupled the moralized imperative and there was a small loosening in my chest, but then I immediately started evaluating whether I’d said it “right,” which is exactly the meta-analytic loop I do. Can we run another quick scenario so I can see how to keep it from transmogrifying into yet another should?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're close to noticing how that loop can happen. Let's try another small step. Imagine you're still sitting at that chart, and you notice the "should" creeping in again. What if, instead of trying to say "I did it right" or "I did it wrong," you simply noticed the thought showing up – just for a tiny moment – without trying to change it?

Patient: When I just notice the thought without trying to fix it, there's a mild decentering—I can label the "should" and my chest loosens a notch and breathing slows. Then the habitual meta-commentary kicks in—“Am I doing this properly?”—and that immediately ratchets the tension back up and turns it into another cognitive task. It's actually promising, though; can we do another brief practice, maybe a timed two-minute script, so I can try to feel the effect in my body instead of just theorizing about it?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to noticing how that small step can actually matter in the moment. Let's try a timed script for the next two minutes. When you notice the "should" creeping in, I want you to simply say "that's what my mind is saying" – without trying to change it or fix it. Just notice the thought showing up, and then... *pause* what matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: Okay, I did the two-minute thing. I noticed the "should," said to myself "that's what my mind is saying," and there was a small decentering—my chest loosened and breathing deepened a notch—then I asked "what matters for this patient in the next minute?" and landed on a concrete, low-stakes action: check their pain score and offer repositioning or reassurance. Almost immediately the meta-analytic voice started critiquing how I said it, which nudged me back into task-mode, but the brief pause did let me act with just a little less compulsion; can we run it again with a cue to take five slow breaths before answering so I can see if that anchors me more in the body?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting more comfortable with that small pause. Let's try it again. When you notice the "should" creeping in, I want you to say "that's what my mind is saying" – and then *pause* – take five slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe, notice what's happening in your body – not the thoughts, just the sensation of the breath. And then... what matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I did the five breaths — felt a subtle loosening in my chest and a faint change in the rhythm of my breathing, though my instinct was to label it as vagal modulation instead of just noticing it. After that brief anchor, what matters right now for this patient in the next minute is checking their pain score, offering repositioning, and giving a concise reassurance so they feel heard. I'm a bit self-conscious that I'm already critiquing whether I noticed it "correctly"—can we try one more round with a cue if that’s okay?


--- Turn 10 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 10]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the anchor held for you, even if your mind is still trying to analyze it. Let's try one more round. When you notice the "should" creeping in, I want you to say "that's what my mind is saying" – and then *pause* – take five slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe, notice what's happening in your body – not the thoughts, just the sensation of the breath. And when you're ready, what matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I did the five breaths—there was a subtle vagal modulation and my chest loosened a notch. After that I landed on something concrete: check the pain score, offer repositioning, and give a brief, validating reassurance, then a quick note in the chart. Saying it out loud feels like effort right now—my mind's already sliding back into meta-analysis—so can we do another brief round with an even simpler cue?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing how to anchor the pause even when it feels like an effort. Let's try a super simple cue: *just notice the thought "I need to say it out loud" without changing it*. Just acknowledge it as a thought, without trying to fix it or make sense of it. What matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: Noticing "I need to say it out loud" — it reads like another prescriptive thought, a meta-loop more than a sensation. For the patient in the next minute: check their pain score, offer repositioning and a brief validating line ("I hear you, I'm here"), and jot a one-line note in the chart. Saying that felt a bit effortful — can we run the cue again but this time have me say it quietly out loud so I practice doing instead of analyzing?


--- Turn 12 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 12]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting more precise about what's happening when you notice that thought. Let's try the cue again, this time with a tiny whisper: *whisper to yourself* "I need to say it out loud". Just say it quietly, without trying to change it or make sense of it. What matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I whispered "I need to say it out loud"—it came out small and my breath felt a little brittle—and what matters now is: check the pain score, offer repositioning, give a brief validating line ("I hear you, I'm here"), and jot a one-line note in the chart. I can feel my attention snagging and the meta-analytic voice kicking in already, so I'm a bit scattered and it's harder than it should be to stay with the simple stuff.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the whisper helped you feel the thought without getting caught up in it. When you notice your attention snagging and the meta-analytic voice showing up, what would it be like to just notice that feeling for a moment – without trying to change it or fix it – and then come back to the simple task of checking the pain score?

Patient: If I just noticed the snag without fixing it, there’s a fleeting decentering — interoceptive cues dampen a bit, chest softens, breathing steadies — and I can actually move to the simple task. Then predictably the meta‑analytic commentary slides back in (“am I doing this right?”) and re‑fractures my attention into another avoidance loop. I could try a micro‑script like “that’s my mind snagging” + one slow inhale as a concrete cue, but I’m anxious it’ll just calcify into another performance rule—can we do a short guided practice with you cueing me?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing how to anchor the snag without getting caught up in it. Let's try a guided practice. I'll cue you to notice the snag and help you stay with the simple task. When you notice your attention snagging and the meta-analytic commentary showing up, I want you to say to yourself: "that's my mind snagging" – and then *pause* – take one slow, deep breath in through your nose. Notice how the breath feels in your body, not the thought. Then, what matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I actually said, out loud, "that's my mind snagging," and took one slow breath — it eased my chest a hair but my attention felt brittle and a hot shamey frustration kept trying to pull me back into critique. What matters in the next minute: check the pain score, offer repositioning, give a brief validating line ("I hear you, I'm here"), and jot a one‑line note in the chart. Saying that felt like work — my head's already parsing whether I did it right — so I'd like another cue to help me stay with the doing, not the analysis.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing how to stay with the simple task despite the snagging thought. Let's try another cue. When you notice the snag and take a slow breath, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm here to do the task, not to fix the thought" – and then *pause* – take one slow, deep breath in through your nose. Notice how the breath feels in your body, not the thought. What matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I said the line and took the breath — there was a tiny unhooking, but a brittle jitter of anxiety and a sharp, shame‑tinged frustration kept yanking me back into meta‑analysis, so saying it out loud felt like an exertion. What matters in the next minute: check the pain score, offer repositioning, give a brief validating line ("I hear you, I'm here"), and jot a one‑line note in the chart — can we try another quick cue to help anchor me to doing instead of analyzing?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to noticing how to stay with the simple task despite the snagging thought. Let's try another cue. When you notice the snag and take a slow breath, I want you to notice the physical sensation of your body holding that thought – like where it's making your heart feel tight or your chest feel constricted – and say to yourself: "I'm holding this thought, not doing this task" – and then *pause* – take one slow, deep breath in through your nose. Notice what happens when you let the thought be present, without trying to fix it. What matters for this patient in the next minute?

Patient: I tried it — I said “I’m holding this thought, not doing this task,” took the breath, and actually felt a tight knot around my sternum and a quick, shame‑y prick that pulled my attention away. But I’m not sure I follow how noticing that bodily tightness actually breaks the meta‑analytic loop instead of becoming another thing to evaluate — it still lands as a procedure I then critique. Can you walk me through exactly how you want me to stay with the sensation and then shift back to the task, maybe with another very short guided practice?


--- Turn 17 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: Let's try to break it down. When you notice the knot in your sternum and the shame-y prick, I want you to notice it exactly as you do – without trying to fix it or change it. Just see it: the tightness, the prickling sensation. And then, I want you to say to yourself: "I see this knot, and I'm noticing it, but I'm not the knot." Not trying to change it, not trying to fix it – just noticing it as a sensation that's happening in your body.

Now, I want you to imagine that knot is like a tiny rock in a river. You're holding onto that rock, but the river is still flowing. You're still doing the task (checking the pain score, offering repositioning, etc.). The knot is just one thing happening in the river – not the whole river.

Let's try a very short practice: when you notice the knot, I want you to say "I see this knot" – and then take one slow, deep breath in through your nose. Notice the knot, and then imagine letting it be present, while you do the task. Just for a moment, like 2 seconds. What happens?

Patient: I tried it — I said “I see this knot” and took the breath. There was a marginal decentering, a faint loosening in my sternum, but the shamey prick reasserted itself almost immediately and my mind just reified it into another procedural object to evaluate. I'm not sure I follow how noticing the sensation doesn't just transmogrify into another thing to monitor—how do I notice it without instrumentalizing it? Can we do one ultra‑brief guided run now where you cue me and I just say the line and breathe for two seconds, very small and discrete, so I can feel how it lands in my body instead of only my head?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: Let's try an ultra-brief practice. When you notice the shame-y prick, I want you to say to yourself: "This is the thought" – just the words, without trying to change it or fix it. And then *pause* – take one slow, deep breath in through your nose for just 2 seconds. That's it. Just 2 seconds.

Patient: I said “This is the thought” and took the two‑second inhale — there was a slight unhooking in my sternum but the shamey prick almost immediately tried to reframe it as proof I’d messed up. I'm not sure I follow how noticing it doesn't just become another procedural thing to monitor and critique. Can you cue me again, very briefly, so I can try to stay with the doing instead of the analysis?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: Let's try again. When you notice the shame-y prick, I want you to say to yourself: "I'm holding this thought" – not to change it, but just to notice it. And then *pause* – take one slow, deep breath in through your nose for 2 seconds.

Patient: I tried it — I said “I’m holding this thought” and took the two‑second inhale. There was a small unhooking in my sternum, but the shamey prick instantly rebranded itself as evidence I’d failed, and that pulled me straight back into meta‑analysis; doing the exercise already feels like another performance metric. I'm a bit foggy and it's effortful to stay with it — can you cue me through one more very short run, maybe count the inhale/out loud so I can sync instead of overthinking?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: Let's try one more time. I want you to notice the shame-y prick, and when you see it, I want you to say "I'm holding this thought" out loud – *I'm holding this thought*. And then, I want you to breathe in for a count of 4, *inhale*, and out for a count of 4, *exhale*. Just focus on the breath, and the words "I'm holding this thought".

Patient: I said "I'm holding this thought" out loud and did the 4-in/4-out — my breathing slowed a notch and there was a faint loosening around my sternum. Then a hot, shamey prick shot up like an accusation and my mind immediately began appraising whether I’d done it "right," which yanked me straight back into analysis. My voice felt thin and the whole thing already registers as another performance metric, which is… draining; could you cue me again out loud so I can try to sync instead of narrate?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: Let's try again. I want you to notice the shame-y prick, and when you see it, I want you to say "I'm holding this thought" out loud – *I'm holding this thought*. And then, I want you to breathe in for a count of 4, *inhale*, and out for a count of 4, *exhale*. *Pause* *Nothing*. Just the breath.

Patient: Okay — I did it. The breath slowed and there was a tiny loosening in my sternum, but almost immediately a hot, shamey prick flipped it into proof I’d messed up and my brain started critiquing whether I’d done it “right.” I’m kind of foggy and it's hard to stay with just the breath — can you cue me out loud or count so I can sync instead of overthinking?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: Let's try it again. I want you to notice the shame-y prick, and when you see it, I want you to say "I'm holding this thought" out loud – *I'm holding this thought*. And then, I want you to breathe in for a count of 4, *inhale*, and out for a count of 4, *exhale*. *Nothing*. *Just the sound of your breath*

Patient: I did it — said “I’m holding this thought” out loud and did the 4-in/4-out. Physiologically there was a tiny decoupling—breath slowed, sternum loosened—but almost immediately the shamey prick recontextualized the exercise as evidence of failure and my appraisal system hijacked it into another performance metric. It’s draining to keep redoing this in my head, so could you count me through it out loud (inhale 1‑2‑3‑4, exhale 1‑2‑3‑4) a couple times so I can sync my body instead of narrating the procedure?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: I'm going to count you through it, and I want you to notice the breath, not the counting. When you notice the shame-y prick, I want you to say "I'm holding this thought" out loud – *I'm holding this thought*. And then, I'll count the breath for you: *inhale 1*, *inhale 2*, *inhale 3*, *inhale 4*, *exhale 1*, *exhale 2*, *exhale 3*, *exhale 4*.

Patient: Okay — I followed your count. My breath slowed and there was a tiny loosening in my chest, but almost as soon as it eased a hot, shamey critique started re-labeling the exercise as another performance metric. It's kind of exhausting to keep redoing this, so could you count me through two more slow cycles and then cue me to do one concrete thing for the patient (like "check pain score now") so I can try to switch from analyzing to actually doing it?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: I'll count you through two more cycles. When you notice the shame-y prick, I want you to say "I'm holding this thought" out loud – *I'm holding this thought*. And then, I'll count the breath for you: *inhale 1*, *inhale 2*, *inhale 3*, *inhale 4*, *exhale 1*, *exhale 2*, *exhale 3*, *exhale 4*. *pause* *inhale 1*, *inhale 2*, *inhale 3*, *inhale 4*, *exhale 1*, *exhale 2*, *exhale 3*, *exhale 4*. 

Now, I want you to notice what matters for this patient right now. What's the one thing you can do to help them in this moment, without getting caught up in the shame-y critique?

Patient: I'll just check their pain score — ask, quietly, "On a 0–10, how's your pain right now?" and listen. My attention's kind of jagged and that shamey critic's already muttering, but I'll tuck in a tiny anchor ("this is care, not proof") and do the question, then jot a one‑line note.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: Checking the pain score can be a powerful way to help the patient, even if your inner critic shows up. By tucking in that tiny anchor ("this is care, not proof"), you're making room for compassion to show up alongside your task-oriented self. When you ask the patient "On a 0–10, how's your pain right now?" and listen, notice what happens in your body – does the shamey critic still show up, or does a small sense of connection or care start to emerge?

Patient: There was a tiny, tangible shift — my chest softened a notch and when I actually asked the pain question I felt a faint, genuine warmth when they answered, like a glimmer of connection. But the shamey critic immediately started recontextualizing it as proof I’d flubbed something, so the connection felt attenuated and a little guilty. I'm kinda drained and my attention keeps skittering, so it takes effort to stay with the moment instead of turning it into another performance metric — could we do one very brief anchor (maybe you cue me once) so I can try to hold that softer feeling while I do the charting?
