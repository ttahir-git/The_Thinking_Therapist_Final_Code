--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been having really intense anxiety in social situations, so I mostly avoid gatherings with friends and just keep to myself. It's gotten worse with the instability in my work as an artist—losing jobs made me more cautious and withdrawn. I don't know, I'm not great at talking about this.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like being in social situations feels really scary for you right now. When you think about those gatherings with friends, what happens in your body when you imagine being there – what does it feel like to be anxious about not knowing what to say or making a mistake?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow, like I’m holding myself together. My stomach knots and my hands get a little shaky, and then my head goes kind of blank so I can't find the words. After that I just clam up and try to make myself small. I don't know… it's really uncomfortable to talk about, so can we not dive too deep into it yet?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Those physical sensations sound really overwhelming. When you try to make yourself small, it feels like you're losing connection to what matters to you – like your art and being with friends.

Patient: Yeah, I guess that's true. When I'm like that my art just feels muted — I can't focus, don't want anyone to see what I'm doing, and I end up avoiding people. I don't know, it's embarrassing to say, and I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It's like your anxiety is pulling you away from what matters to you, and that's really painful. What if, just for a moment, you could notice that feeling of overwhelm without trying to fix it – like you're just holding onto it, even if it's hard?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to hold it, it feels like a heavy pressure in my chest and this buzzing in my head that makes everything fuzzy. I can try to notice it for a little while, but I'm already getting tense — can we keep it slow and gentle?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Just for a tiny moment – what would it be like to notice that buzzing and pressure in your chest *while* you're trying to talk about your art, and your desire to connect with friends? Not to fix it, but just to notice it, with that small space in your chest.

Patient: I don't know... if I try to notice the buzzing while I talk about my work, the words get heavy, like I'm trying to paint with mittens on. There's this small tightness in my chest that steals my breath and my thoughts—my sentences just stop and I want to clam up. I guess I can try to keep noticing, but can we go really slowly? I'm already getting a bit tight.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice while talking about your art feels like it's already happening too much – like you're trying to hold onto two things at once. What if, instead, you tried noticing that tightness *while* you're not talking about your art – just for a moment, while you're sitting here with me?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to notice it without talking about my art it just gets louder, like a fist pressing my ribs and my breath gets shallow. My head goes fuzzy and I want to clam up or talk about something else. Can we go really slowly? Maybe tell me what you mean by "notice" because I'm already getting tense.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: When I say "notice", I just mean being aware of it – not trying to change it, not judging it, just seeing what's there. Like when you notice the buzzing in your head, I'm not saying "Oh, it's bad" – I'm just saying "There's a buzzing in your head". Would it be okay if we just started with that small step, noticing the buzzing *just as it is*, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I don't know... I can try to notice it for a little bit, but it already feels like a fist in my chest and I get shaky. Can we go really slowly? If it gets worse I'll say so — I don't want to shut down, I just get overwhelmed.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Let's take one tiny step together. When you notice the buzzing in your head, I want you to notice it *just for a second* – that one second. Not to try to fix it, not to change it, just to notice it. And when that second is up, you can tell me – or take a deep breath – and we'll move forward from there.

Patient: Okay, I can try that. I noticed the buzzing for that one second — it got sharp, my chest clenched and my breath went thin, and then I took a slow breath like you said. It helped a little but I’m still shaky and my head feels fuzzy. I don't know... can we keep it really slow and just do that breathing a couple more times?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Let's keep going with that slow breath. Just notice the feeling in your chest *while* you breathe in – not to change it, just to see what's there. When you breathe out, notice the feeling *while* you let it go. No trying to fix it, no stopping it – just noticing it as it is.

Patient: Okay, I did the breath like you said — on the in the tightness felt closer, and on the out it eased a bit but the buzzing stayed. My hands are still shaky and my head's fuzzy, and I guess I feel kind of exposed when we focus on it. I don't know... can we keep it really slow and do the breathing a few more times?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness and the buzzing is making you feel a bit more connected to it – and that's okay. When you breathe in, notice that feeling of tightness *as you breathe in* – not to change it, but to see what's there. When you breathe out, notice the buzzing *as you let it go* – not to stop it, but to see what's left. We'll keep going with that slow breath for just a moment.

Patient: Okay, I did the breaths with you — the tightness moves in on the inhale and eases a bit on the out, but the buzzing just hangs around. I don't know, it's getting kind of heavy and hard to focus; can we keep it really slow and just stay with the breathing for a little longer?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the tightness and the buzzing is making it hard to stay with the breathing – but that's okay. When you feel the tightness moving in, notice it *as it moves in* – not to try to stop it, but to see what it means. When you feel the buzzing hanging around, notice it *as it is* – not to try to fix it, but to see what's there. We'll keep going with that slow breath for just a moment, and then we'll see what happens.

Patient: I did a few more breaths — the tightness eases a bit on the out but the buzzing just hangs there, and I'm kind of worn out. I don't know, it's getting hard to focus; can we take it even slower? Maybe instead of more noticing, could we talk about one tiny, practical thing I might try before a gathering so I don't panic?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the buzzing is still there, but you're feeling really tired and worn out from trying to notice it. Taking it even slower sounds like a good idea. Talking about a tiny, practical thing that might help you feel more connected to your art and friends before a gathering – that's a great idea. What if, for just a minute, you imagined showing up to a gathering and doing something small, like sharing a piece of art or listening to a friend's story? What would that feel like, not to try to control it, but just to imagine?

Patient: I don't know... I guess imagining it makes my chest tighten but there's this tiny flicker of something like relief, like maybe I could say one quiet thing about a sketch. Holding that thought feels a bit fragile and I'm kind of worn out — can we break it into one really small, doable step I could try before a gathering?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tiny flicker of relief is worth noticing – even if it feels fragile. What if, just for a moment, you could try making that tiny step of saying one quiet thing about a sketch *before* you even think about the gathering? Not to impress anyone, not to fix it, just to see what happens when you say it out loud. Like, "This line feels interesting to me..." or "I'm not sure what I think of this color..."?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try saying something tiny like, "This line feels interesting to me," quietly to myself in the car before I go. I'm kind of wiped out—could we just practice it once here, really slowly?


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: Let's practice it just for a moment, slowly. When you say "This line feels interesting to me," what happens to your body and breath while you're saying it? Not to change it, just to notice it.

Patient: I don't know... when I try to say it quietly to myself my chest clamps down and my breath gets shallow, my voice goes thin and my hands tremble a little. There's this hot, sinking wash of shame that makes me want to shrink away, and then my head fogs over so I lose the rest of the sentence. I'm kind of wiped out just saying that — can we keep it really slow if we try it once here?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the sensations you're noticing are really strong – the chest clamping, the shallow breath, the trembling hands, the shame, and the fogging over. What would happen to that shame if you noticed it *just as it is*, without trying to push it away or change it? Could you make space for that feeling, just for a moment, while you're still saying the sentence?

Patient: I don't know... when I try to make space for the shame it just rushes in and my chest tightens and my voice goes thin, and then my head goes blank and I can't finish the sentence. I guess if I notice it "as it is" it feels huge and annoying, but maybe it thins out a little instead of stabbing — it's hard to tell. I'm kind of wiped and fuzzy; can we do that one quiet line once more, really slowly?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the shame "as it is" feels like a tightrope to walk. What if, instead of trying to push it away, you could try making room for it *while* you're saying the sentence? Like, "This line feels interesting to me..." *and* "I feel this shame when I try to say it..."?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try, but even saying that second part makes my chest drop and this hot, sinking shame flare up like I messed up again, and my voice goes thin. I'm kind of wiped and fuzzy—can we do it one time, really slowly, and maybe you say the lines first so I can follow?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: I'll say the lines first. "This line feels interesting to me..." *and* "I feel this shame when I try to say it..." Notice what happens in your body while you're saying those words. *then* I'll wait for you to say it.

Patient: Okay... when you said it my chest tightened and my breath went thin, like I couldn't get the words out. I don't know, but I'll try.

"This line feels interesting to me..." I feel this shame when I try to say it...

My voice went thin, my hands trembled, and then my head fogged—I'm kind of wiped. Can we just sit with a slow breath for a moment before doing more?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're already doing it – noticing the sensations and the shame, even when it feels hard. When you sat with the slow breath, what happened to the shame and the tightness in your chest?

Patient: I don't know... when I sat with the slow breath the tightness loosened a bit on the out-breath, but the shame just lingered at the edges like a knot that won't come undone. My voice stayed thin and my head's fuzzy — I'm kind of worn out. Can we just keep breathing slowly for a little while longer?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that knot of shame is still there, even when you're not trying to push it away. What if, instead of trying to untie it, you just kept breathing slowly *with* it – like you were holding the knot and the breath at the same time?

Patient: I don't know... I tried breathing with the knot and it loosens a little on the out-breath, but the knot stays and this hot, sinking shame flashes up like I messed up again. My chest still feels heavy and my head's foggy—I'm kind of wiped and it's hard to stay focused. Maybe... could we do the slow breath a couple more times, and then try that tiny car-line one more time? Keep it really slow, please.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a bit more comfortable with the slow breath. When you're ready, let's try it one more time. *take a slow breath in*... and *out*. Just notice what's there *when you're not trying*.

And when you're ready, we can try that tiny line again – "This line feels interesting to me..." *and* "I feel this shame when I try to say it...".

Patient: I don't know... I tried the slow breath. "This line feels interesting to me..." "I feel this shame when I try to say it..." My voice went thin, my chest clenched, and that hot, sinking shame flared like I messed up — I'm kind of wiped. Can we take a few more slow breaths together before we do anything else?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that shame is still really strong when you try to say the line. *takes a slow breath*... *and* *out*. Just notice what's there *when you're not trying*. We can just sit with that feeling for a moment, without trying to do anything about it.

Patient: I don't know... I did the breath with you. The tightness eased a touch on the out-breath, but the shame's still there — heavy and buzzy — and I'm feeling pretty wiped, so it's hard to keep focus. Can we just sit with it quietly for a few more slow breaths together?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *takes a slow breath*... *and* *out*. Just notice what's there, even if it feels hard. We can just sit together in silence for a moment, without trying to change it.

Patient: I don't know... sitting here with the breaths helps a little — the tightness eases on the out-breath but the shame still nags at the edges. I'm pretty wiped; can we keep the slow breaths a bit longer? After that, maybe we could plan one tiny, practical thing I can try before a gathering, like the car-line phrase — I'm nervous about it but I think I need something simple.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the slow breaths are helping you feel a bit more grounded, even if the shame is still there. *takes a slow breath*... *and* *out*. We can keep going for just a little while longer.

When you're ready, let's think about that tiny, practical thing you'd like to try before a gathering. What if, instead of trying to do it perfectly, you just tried to do it with that car-line phrase – "This line feels interesting to me..." *and* "I feel this shame when I try to say it..."?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try that car-line before a gathering, but the shame still flares up when I even think about it. Maybe we can break it into three tiny steps I can actually do: 1) practice once in the car, 2) take a slow breath and say the quiet line to myself, 3) decide then if I stay or leave. I'm kind of wiped—can we go through those steps really slowly right now, just one at a time?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by the shame, but you're willing to try breaking it down into smaller steps. Let's start with the first step: practicing the car-line in the car. What would it look like to you if you just *practiced* it once, without trying to change it or push away the shame?

Patient: I don't know... I guess practicing in the car would look like sitting in a parked car, locking the door, taking one slow breath, and whispering the line quietly to myself. Then add, just once, "I feel this shame when I try to say it," and notice what my chest and breath do without trying to fix anything. I'm kind of wiped—can we try that here now, really slowly, just one time?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: Let's try it right here, with me. *locks imaginary door* *takes a slow breath*... *whispers* "This line feels interesting to me..." *pauses*... *whispers* "I feel this shame when I try to say it..." *notices chest and breath*

Patient: I tried it — I whispered "This line feels interesting to me" and then "I feel this shame when I try to say it." My chest clenched, my voice went thin, and that hot shame came up so my head got fuzzy, but on the out-breath it eased a tiny bit. I don't know... I'm kind of worn out; can we sit with a few slow breaths before we try the next step?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that was really hard for you, but you did it anyway. *takes a slow breath*... *and* *out*. Just notice what's there *when you're not trying*. We can sit with it for a moment, without trying to change it.

Patient: I don't know... I did the breath — it helped a little; the tightness eased on the out-breath but the shame's still buzzing and my head's fuzzy. I'm kind of wiped; can we do a few more slow breaths together, and then maybe try that second step really slowly?
