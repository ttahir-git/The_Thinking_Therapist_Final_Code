--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I moved recently and it's been eating at me. I'm snapping at people—neighbors, the guys from work, even my partner—and I can't seem to keep it together when things go wrong with the move. I don't know, I guess I'm just tired of feeling like I'm about to blow up over small stuff.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When that anger starts showing up, what happens in your body—like your chest tightening or your jaw clenched—when you snap at someone?

Patient: My chest tightens real quick, like I can't take a full breath, and my jaw clamps down — I notice my hands ball into fists. I get hot in the face, my shoulders go up, and I start breathing fast, then I say things before I think. I don't know, I guess I try to step away but sometimes I just keep going.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That sounds like a really intense physical response. When you notice your chest tightening and your hands balling into fists, what's happening to your thoughts or stories about what's happening right in that moment—like, "I'm going to lose control" or "This is so frustrating"—while you're noticing that physical response?

Patient: I start telling myself they're doing it on purpose or that everything's falling apart and I'm the one messing it up. Then there's this louder thought—"Don't let them see you lose it"—and that just tightens me up more. I don't know, I guess I'm scared I'll actually lose control and make things worse. Can we... maybe not go too deep into that right now?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like those thoughts are really close to the edge of what you're feeling right now. When you notice that voice saying "Don't let them see you lose it," what might happen if you simply made room for that fear to be there, without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I don't know. I guess if I let that fear be there it just feels like admitting I'm weak and it'll grab hold of me more — then I get angrier. Can we slow down? I need something practical for when my chest tightens and I'm about to snap.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Let's find a small step that might help. What if, when your chest starts tightening, you noticed that sensation without trying to change it? Just as you said, without pushing the thoughts away. And then, for one tiny moment, you took a tiny breath in through your nose and out through your mouth, and you looked at the person right in front of you with kindness.

Patient: Okay... I don't know, I guess I can try that — the tiny breath sounds doable. But honestly, when I'm on the job or in my truck I don't want to be staring at someone with kindness; I need something practical I can do with my hands or that I can do quick without making a scene. What would you suggest for that?


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: When you're in that situation, what might happen if, while you're still feeling the anger, you did one small thing with your hands that wasn't related to trying to fix the situation—like rubbing your palms together, or tapping your fingers on the steering wheel?

Patient: I don't know, I guess rubbing my palms or tapping my fingers could work — or squeezing something in my pocket, like a coin or one of those little foam things. I like the idea of clenching and then letting go so it doesn't look like I'm losing it, but I'm skeptical it’ll actually calm me down when I'm that wound up. Can you give me a couple more really low-key options I could do in my truck or on site?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: If rubbing your palms or tapping your fingers doesn't feel like it's going to calm you down right away, what if you did something else that's just a tiny bit more noticeable—like shifting your weight in your seat, or taking a sip of water?

Patient: Okay, yeah — I can try the shift or the sip, but give me a couple more quiet things I can do without making a scene. Maybe: press my heels into the floor and hold for a slow count of five then release; squeeze a coin or a small rock in my pocket and roll it with my thumb; or do a silent 4-4 breath (in for four, out for four) so it doesn't look like I'm hyperventilating. I don't know, I guess the coin squeeze or the heel press sound most doable on site — what do you think?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: Those all sound like they could be really helpful in the moment. When you're feeling that anger and your chest is tight, which of those small actions might you be able to do without thinking about it too much—like just noticing your feet on the floor or the weight of the coin in your pocket?

Patient: I think the coin/rock in my pocket and the heel‑press are the easiest — I can do them without anyone noticing. In my truck I’d roll the coin or take a quick sip of water; on site I’d press my heels or try a quiet 4‑4 breath if I can. I don't know, I guess start with the coin and heel press and see if that helps?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: Let's try that. When your chest starts tightening and you feel that anger showing up, what happens if you noticed the coin in your pocket first—just for a tiny moment, without trying to change it—and then you pressed your heels into the floor?

Patient: I think noticing the coin would pull me out of the spiral for a second — it gives my hands something to do. Pressing my heels actually makes my chest drop a bit and I can breathe easier instead of clenching up. I don't know, I guess I’d want to try it a few times on the job before I trust it; can we talk through a quick plan for practicing it without making a scene?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: That's a great start. When you're on the job and you feel that chest tightening, what would happen if, for just 2 seconds, you took a tiny breath in through your nose, noticed the coin in your pocket, and pressed your heels into the floor, even if it felt just a little awkward?

Patient: I guess I could do that for two seconds — it might break the spiral long enough to not blow up. I don't know, it feels awkward but doable; I'll try it a couple times on the job when things are quiet. Can you help me pick a simple cue so I actually remember to do it without making a scene?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: What if, when you're about to get frustrated or feel that anger, you said to yourself "just one breath" or "one coin" or "heels down"?

Patient: I guess "one coin" sounds most doable — nobody notices and I can actually hold something. I don't know, I'm worried I'll forget it when I'm really wound up; can we pick a quick practice routine or reminder so it becomes automatic? And if I don't have a coin, what's a good backup cue?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: When you're on the job and you need to remember to do the "one coin" thing, what if you tied it to something already familiar, like taking a sip of water or noticing the clock ticking?

Patient: I don't know, I guess tying "one coin" to a sip of water makes sense — I drink water all the time, so that could snap me out of it. Other easy cues: putting my gloves on, starting the truck, hearing the lunch/break whistle, or when I reach for my phone. If I don't have a coin, backing up with pressing my thumb into my palm, rolling my heel, or a quiet 4‑4 breath could work. I'll try to pick one and practice it a few times so it actually sticks, but I'm skeptical it'll be automatic right away.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting a sense of what might work for you. When you try one of those cues, what would happen if, just for a tiny moment, you noticed the coin in your pocket or the sound of the water bottle opening—without trying to change it or make it happen, but just noticing it?

Patient: I guess if I actually notice the coin or the water bottle for a second it might snap me out of the spiral long enough to do the heel press or the squeeze. I don't know, it still feels weird to just "notice" stuff instead of fixing whatever's pissing me off — makes me want to change the subject. Can we do a quick, simple rehearsal now so I can see how it feels in practice?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: Let's try a quick rehearsal. When you're sitting here, what if you noticed the coin in your pocket right now, without trying to change it or fix anything? Just for a second, notice it.

Patient: Okay... I can feel it — cold and smooth against my thigh, a little ridged on the edge. My chest actually loosened for a second and I could take a deeper breath. I don't know, I guess noticing it made me less wound up, but it still feels awkward. Can we try the heel‑press next and go over how to do it when I'm standing on a ladder or hauling stuff?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: That's a great start. When you're standing on a ladder or hauling stuff, what if, for just a moment, you noticed the heel of your foot touching the ground, and then you pressed it down, even if it felt a little awkward?

Patient: Yeah, I can do the heel‑press when I'm standing flat — it sorta grounds me and lets me breathe. On a ladder that feels risky though; I don't know, I guess I'd be more likely to brace my legs, press the balls of my feet into the rung, or shift my weight to steady myself instead of a full heel press. When I'm hauling stuff, planting my feet shoulder‑width and pressing my heels down while I breathe sounds doable. Can you give me one quick, safe move for when I'm actually on a ladder?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: When you're on a ladder and you need to take a moment, what if you did just a tiny heel press, just for a fraction of a second, right where your foot is touching the rung?

Patient: I guess I could try a tiny press with whatever part of my foot's on the rung — just a quick shift to steady myself. On a ladder I already brace with my legs, so I'd probably press the ball of my foot and shift my weight instead of a full heel press, but it feels weird doing anything deliberate up there. I don't know, I guess I'll try it a couple times — can we go over how to do it safely so I don't lose my balance?


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: When you're on a ladder, it's great that you're already bracing with your legs. When you try the tiny heel press, what if you did it while keeping your weight centered over the rung, and just shifted your foot back onto it for a quick moment, while you breathe?

Patient: Okay, I can see that — keep my weight centered, shift my foot back onto the rung a bit, do a quick press and take a breath. How long should I hold it — one slow breath or just a count of two? I don't know, I guess I'm worried I'll lose my grip if I focus on it too long, so what's the fastest, safest version if I need it in a hurry?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: When you're on a ladder and you need to take a moment, what if you held it for just a single, slow breath, and then released?

Patient: Okay — one slow breath and release sounds doable. I guess I'll keep three points of contact and just do a quick press with whatever part of my foot is on the rung so I don't screw up my balance. I don't know, I'm still nervous about getting distracted up there—what's a super-fast, safe version if I need it in a hurry?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: If you need it even faster, what if you just made room for the "I'm okay" thought while you're pressing your foot onto the rung, without needing to focus on it for long?

Patient: Yeah... I guess I could try that — just a quick "I'm okay" in my head while I press the rung. Seems stupid, but it's fast and I won't lose my grip. I don't know, I guess if that doesn't cut it, what should I do next?


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: That "I'm okay" thought might just be enough to help you stay calm. If that doesn't feel like it's working for you, what if, when you're feeling really stuck or worried, you tried taking one tiny step down from the ladder, just to get your feet on firmer ground?

Patient: I don't know, I guess stepping down for a second could help — but I'd hate to look like I'm bailing or lose time. It's starting to wear on me. If I can't step down, what's the absolute fastest, safest thing I can do without letting go of the ladder?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: If you can't step down, what if you just took a tiny moment to notice the sensation of your feet on the rungs, and said to yourself "I've got this" for just a second, while keeping your weight centered?

Patient: Yeah... I can try that — notice my feet, mumble "I've got this" in my head, keep my weight centered. I don't know, I guess it feels a little dumb but it's quick and won't mess with my grip. If that still doesn't do it, what do I do next?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. If that doesn't work when you need it to, what if you made a deal with yourself to try it just one more time, whenever you're feeling stuck or worried while on the ladder?

Patient: Yeah... I guess I can promise to try it one more time when I'm on a ladder. But if I'm already halfway into snapping and that doesn't pull me back, I don't know—what's the absolute fastest fallback I can use that won't make me look weak or mess with my balance?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: If the "I've got this" thing isn't working when it matters most, what if you just made room for the fact that you're doing the best you can, and that's enough to keep you going?

Patient: I don't know, I guess telling myself "I'm doing the best I can" might help a little — it's softer than "I've got this." But if my heart's already racing, that probably won't stop it. If it gets bad, the fastest safe fallback for me is a one‑second hard grip on the rung while keeping three points of contact, or pressing my thumb into my palm or rolling a coin in my pocket — something tactile to buy a beat. Can you give me one really short, non‑sappy phrase to keep in my head for those moments? Also... can we slow down a bit? This is starting to wear on me.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: When you need it most, what if you kept the thought "hold" in your head, just for a beat?

Patient: Okay... 'hold' sounds simple enough. I don't know, I guess it's easy to mumble in my head without looking like an idiot. If that doesn't pull me back, what's my fastest backup—coin squeeze or a one‑second hard grip? Also can we slow down a bit? This is starting to wear on me.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: When all else fails, what if you squeezed your coin for one second, just to anchor yourself?

Patient: Yeah... I guess squeezing the coin for one second could work — quick, quiet, something to feel. If I don't have a coin, pressing my thumb into my palm or a one‑second hard grip on the rung is a good backup. I don't know, can we slow down a bit? This is starting to wear on me.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. When you need to make a move on the ladder, what would happen if you just noticed the "hold" thought for one second, and then chose to squeeze the coin, press your thumb, or grip the rung?

Patient: Okay... I guess I can try that — think "hold" for a beat, squeeze the coin or press my thumb or do a quick one‑second grip, then move. I don't know, I'm starting to run out of steam here, can we slow down a bit? And if that doesn't pull me back, what's the absolute fastest next move I should do?
