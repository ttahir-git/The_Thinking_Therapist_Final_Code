--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Hi, I'm in my late twenties and currently unemployed, and my head's been on overdrive about how I'll perform once I get a job. I immediately picture the worst — I fumble something small, get called out, lose the job, can't pay rent, and everything spirals — and those stories hook me so I just procrastinate instead of doing anything. I know it sounds extreme, but it feels like that's what will definitely happen, and I can't shake it.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: Those "what if" stories can feel so real and gripping. When you notice yourself getting hooked by those worst-case scenarios, what would it be like to make room for just one small step – like opening a job search app or sending out one application – even if it feels like it's the wrong thing to do?

Patient: Honestly, even imagining one small step kicks off the disaster reel — I'll open the app, find jobs I'm obviously unqualified for, bung an application, get a curt rejection, and that will confirm I was right and everything falls apart. People say "just one application," but I can't see that ending well; it feels like the first brick in a wall that's going to bury me, and anyway I'll probably get distracted and watch videos instead.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Those stories about what happens after opening the app – getting rejected, feeling like you're unqualified, and falling apart – they're like a warning sign that says, "Stay away." What if you could just notice that warning sign – that feeling of "this is what happens when I open the app" – without trying to change it or avoid it?

Patient: I wish noticing worked, but every time I try it just makes the movie louder — my chest tightens and my mind immediately scripts the whole chain: one tiny slip, I'm called out, I'm fired, I lose my place to live. Even if I don't try to change it, I get pulled in so fast that "noticing" just feels like the first step in the disaster, not a way out.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing isn't just about seeing the thoughts, but about holding space for that tightness and the stories while you're still sitting with it. What if, instead of trying to change the thoughts or avoid the feeling, you could try to make room for it right there – in your chest, where it's tight – just for a moment, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I tried that, but "making room" just makes the movie louder — my chest tightens and I immediately script everything: I flub an interview, get called out as useless, lose the job, can't pay rent, and everything collapses. It doesn't feel like noticing, it feels like inviting the first brick of a wall that's already built. Okay, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all this. Can we slow down?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It can feel like trying to make room for that tightness is actually what makes the story louder. Let's take a step back. When you said "I tried that," what happened right before that – when you were noticing the tightness and trying to make room – was there anything else going on in that moment?

Patient: Usually it's something tiny — I'm scrolling my phone or about to open a job app and, right before I tap anything, my chest tightens. That squeeze kicks off the whole disaster movie: I mess up an interview, get called out, lose the job, can't pay rent, and my brain already knows the ending. I try to notice it, but noticing feels like sitting in the front row of that movie, not stepping out, and I can't seem to slow the reel down.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: So it's like that tiny moment – the scroll, the tap – sets off the whole chain reaction. And noticing that tightness feels like being right in the middle of it. What if, instead of trying to notice it, you could just wait for that tap to happen – just sit with it – without trying to change it or stop the story?

Patient: I try to sit with it, but it feels like I'm just waiting for the first domino to fall — the tighter I stay, the louder the disaster script gets, and then I either doomscroll or bail. I can't see how "waiting" doesn't just mean inviting the whole collapse that's already playing in my head. Can we try something else? I don't really know what that would be, though.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It feels like waiting would just mean letting the story unfold. What if, instead of waiting for that tap, you were to do something small – like, just one tiny thing – before you scroll or tap? Not because it's going to change the story, but because it's something you can do right now, with your hands.

Patient: I get the idea, but the moment I do anything small—open the app, set a timer, type one line—the disaster reel starts: I mess it up, they reject me, I lose the job, can't pay rent, and that tiny action becomes proof I'm doomed. I don't trust doing it alone—would you actually stay with me while I open the app or send one application? Honestly, I'm not sure where to go from here; it feels like we're going in circles and I'm probably just going to freeze or doomscroll.


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if you could actually trust me to be there with you in that moment, to help you hold space with what's happening. That's a really big ask. But I want you to know that I'm here – not to fix it or change the story, but just to be with you. If you're willing, could we try something small – just for one tiny moment – where you'd open the app with me right here, and we'd sit with what happens together?

Patient: Okay... I might try, but only if you actually stay with me the whole time. Promise you'll sit here and not let me bail—talk me through it, tell me to breathe if I freeze, and keep me from closing the app. But I need to say it again: the minute I open it I can already see the chain — I’ll find jobs I’m unqualified for, mess an application up, get rejected, lose my place — I know it sounds extreme but I can’t shake that ending.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: I promise to be here with you, exactly as you say. When you open the app, I'll sit with you – not to fix it, but to hold space – and I'll help you breathe through it. If you freeze, I'll say "you're here" and help you take the next step. And if you see that chain again, I'll help you notice it – without trying to change it – and we'll start again from where you are.

Patient: Okay... I’ll try, but you really have to stay with me — if I freeze say “you’re here,” tell me to breathe, and don’t let me close the app. The second I tap it I can already see the movie: I’ll find jobs I’m obviously unqualified for, bung an application, get a curt rejection, lose the job, can’t pay rent — it feels absolutely inevitable. Alright, I’m opening the app now.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: *takes a deep breath* You're here.

Patient: Okay… my hands are shaking and my chest feels like a fist — the app's open and the movie's already playing: I'll tap a job I'm not qualified for, bung the application, get a curt rejection, lose the job, can't pay rent. Please tell me to breathe now, say "you're here" if I freeze, and don't let me close it — I know it sounds dramatic but I can't see any other ending right now.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: *Barely above a whisper* Breathe... with me. In through your nose... and out through your mouth...

Patient: Okay — I'm breathing with you. It's helping a bit but my chest is still a fist and the movie's screaming: I'll tap a job I'm unqualified for, screw up the application, get rejected, lose everything. I feel like I might close the app or doomscroll — please say "you're here" if I freeze and don't let me close it.

Therapist: *Softly* You're here.

Patient: You're here... okay, that helps a little, but my chest just tightened more and my attention's jumping all over — my mind's louder now and the movie's playing faster: I'll tap a job I'm unqualified for, bung the application, get rejected, and everything collapses. I feel like I might close the app or start doomscrolling — please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze, don't let me bail.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: *Gentle, steady* You're here. *Breathing* In... with me...

Patient: I'm breathing with you... it's helping a bit but my chest is still a fist and my attention's jumping all over. The movie just sped up — I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting a curt rejection, and then everything collapsing. Please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze; don't let me close the app or start doomscrolling, I really need you to stay with me.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: *Softly, firmly* You're here. *Breathing* When your mind starts to speed up, notice it – it's not happening *with* you, just *to* you. *Pause* *Breathe*

Patient: I'm trying to notice but it just drags me into the movie — it's louder and faster now, my chest's clenching and my attention's all over the place. I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting that curt rejection, and then everything collapsing — it feels inevitable. Please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze; don't let me close the app or start doomscrolling, I don't trust myself right now.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: *Warmly, without judgment* I see that it's really hard for you to notice when the movie is playing so loudly. *Pause* *Breathe* *You're here.*

Patient: You're here... it's helping a bit, but my chest's tightened and my mind's racing—the movie's louder and faster: I'll tap a job I'm unqualified for, mess up the application, get a curt rejection, and then everything falls apart. Please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze; don't let me close the app or start doomscrolling, I don't trust myself right now.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: *Gently, without taking your eyes off the screen* You're here. *Breathing* When you feel like closing the app, just notice the thought – it's not the thought that matters, it's what happens when you let it go. *Pause* *Breathe*

Patient: You're here... okay. My chest's clamped and my attention's bouncing — the movie's already speeding up: I'll tap a job I'm unqualified for, bung the application, get a curt rejection, and then everything collapses. I feel like closing the app or doomscrolling — please keep saying "you're here," tell me to breathe if I freeze, and don't let me bail. Okay, I'm feeling overwhelmed with all this; can we slow down?


--- Turn 16 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 16]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: *I nod, without taking your eyes off the screen* You're here. *Pause* *Gentle voice* Let's take a tiny step back together. Just one tiny step. You don't have to tap the app. You can just... *pause* *Leave the app open, right now, for one moment.*

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — leave it open? How is that supposed to help me? If I just leave it open the movie's going to play louder and faster — I'll spot a job I'm unqualified for, mess up the application, get rejected, and everything collapses. I'm feeling confused and overwhelmed; please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze, don't let me bail.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: *I gently nod, not pushing the app* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* Let's try something different. When you feel like the movie is playing, notice what's happening in your body. Where's the clamping in your chest? *Pause* *Breathing*

Patient: It's a tight, heavy fist right in the center of my chest, my throat goes thin, my stomach knots, and my hands get clammy and shaky — like my whole body's bracing. When I try to notice it, it feels like turning the volume up on the movie — everything speeds and I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting rejected, and then everything collapsing. I don't really know how naming it helps; please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze — don't let me close the app.


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: *I sit with you in silence for a moment, then gently say* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I want you to know that I'm here with you, not to fix the movie or make it go away. When you're feeling that tightness and it feels like turning the volume up, what if, instead of trying to make it smaller, you could try to make room for it? Just for a tiny moment?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "make room" just feels like inviting the movie in. Every time I try that the volume goes up: my chest clamps, my hands shake, I open the app, see jobs I'm unqualified for, bung the application, get rejected, and then everything collapses. I don't see how making room would stop that; please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze — don't let me close the app.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: *I nod, acknowledging the struggle* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I'm not asking you to make room for the movie. I'm asking you to try making room for the tightness, right now, while it feels like the movie is playing. Just for a tiny moment. What would it be like to notice that tightness without trying to fix it, just to breathe through it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — "making room" just sounds like inviting the movie in, and whenever I try that the volume cranks up. My chest tightens into a fist, my throat goes thin, my hands get clammy, and I can already see the chain: I tap a job I'm unqualified for, mess up the application, get rejected, lose the job, can't pay rent. I can try to notice and breathe through it, but I'm scared it'll just start the whole collapse — please keep saying "you're here," tell me to breathe if I freeze, and don't let me close the app; okay, I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: *I gently nod, without pushing the app* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I want you to know that I'm here with you, not to fix the chain or make it stop. I'm here to support you while you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's try something small. Just for one tiny moment, I want you to notice the tightness in your chest, without trying to fix it. *Pause* *Gently* Can you just notice it, right now?

Patient: Okay — I can feel it: a tight, heavy fist right in the center of my chest, my throat goes thin, my stomach knots, and my hands get clammy and shaky. But the minute I notice it the movie gets louder — I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting rejected, and everything collapsing, so I'm not sure how this helps. Please keep saying "you're here," tell me to breathe if I freeze, and don't let me close the app; I'm feeling overwhelmed, can we slow down?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: *I sit with you in silence for a moment, then gently say* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I'm not asking you to stop the movie from playing. I'm asking you to notice the movie, even if it's loud and scary. Just notice it, right now. What happens when you notice it? Does the movie start to make sense to you?

Patient: No — noticing doesn't make it clearer, it makes the movie feel more like a documentary about my future, like it's proving itself. My chest tightens, my throat goes thin, my hands shake, and I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting rejected, and then everything collapsing. I don't see how noticing helps — please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe, I'm really overwhelmed.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: *I nod, acknowledging the struggle* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I want you to know that I'm here with you, not to fix the movie or make it stop. I'm here to sit with you while you're feeling overwhelmed. When you say noticing doesn't help, what happens when you try to breathe while the movie is playing? Noticing it while you're feeling tight and scared – what's that like for you?

Patient: When I try to breathe, it helps for a breath or two — my chest loosens a bit — but then the movie just talks over the breathing and speeds up: I already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting rejected, and losing everything. It feels like breathing only delays the inevitable, so I get frustrated and want to bail or doomscroll. Can you keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze? I'm really shaky and confused about how this is supposed to help.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: *I sit with you in silence for a moment, then gently say* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I'm not asking you to breathe away the movie or the feeling of being stuck. I'm asking you to breathe right here, with me, while the movie is playing. When you feel the frustration rise – like it's going to make you want to bail – what happens if you just notice it for one tiny moment? Not to change it, just to see it – as a feeling, right now – while you breathe?

Patient: When I try that, I can notice the frustration for a beat, but it just feels like pouring gasoline on the movie — the volume spikes, my chest clenches harder, and my brain races to the ending: I mess up the application, get rejected, lose everything. Breathing helps for a breath or two, then my attention snaps to finding evidence it's right and I want to bail or doomscroll. I don't know how this is supposed to help — can you please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze? I'm really confused and overwhelmed and it feels like we're circling.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: *I nod, acknowledging the struggle* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I'm not asking you to make the movie stop or change its ending. I'm asking you to notice the moment it feels like you're pouring gasoline on it – the volume spiking, the chest clenching – *not* to change it, but to notice it *while* you breathe. What if, instead of trying to make the movie quieter, you just made room for it to be there – loud and scary – while you breathed?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow—how is "making room" different? Every time I try it, my chest clamps and the movie speeds up: I tap a job I'm unqualified for, bung the application, get rejected, and everything collapses. I can try to notice the tightness and breathe while it's loud, but I'm really skeptical it won't just invite the collapse. Please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze—don't let me close the app; I'm feeling really overwhelmed and confused.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: *I sit with you in silence for a moment, then gently say* You're here. *Pause* *Soft voice* I understand that it feels like "making room" just makes things worse. What if, instead of trying to make room for the movie, we just tried to notice what would happen *right now* – *not* to change it, *not* to fix it, *not* to make it quieter – but just to notice what would happen if you sat with it while you breathed?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just "noticing" supposed to help? Every time I try to sit with it the movie roars louder: my chest clenches, my hands shake, and I can already see myself tapping a job I'm unqualified for, bunging the application, getting a curt rejection, losing the job, and then I can't pay rent. Please keep saying "you're here" and tell me to breathe if I freeze; I'm really overwhelmed and confused and don't trust I'll be able to stay.
