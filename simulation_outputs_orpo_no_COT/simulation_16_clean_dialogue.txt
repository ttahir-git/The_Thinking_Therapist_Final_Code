Patient: I'm a nurse, and since my partner died I've been feeling stuck and directionless — I don't know who I am outside of work. Lately all I can think about is whether anything matters to me beyond caring for others, and it's eating away at my self-esteem. I've tried talking about this before and it didn't help — how is this supposed to help now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a deep sense of disconnection from what matters most to you right now. That feeling of emptiness can be really tough when it's tied to your identity as a nurse. 

When you say "I don't know who I am outside of work," what happens if you made room for that question to be present, even if you couldn't answer it right now? What would it be like to notice that question, like a whisper, while you're sitting with the pain of not knowing what matters to you?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When I try to "sit with" the question I get restless — my chest tightens and I start thinking I'm failing, like everything outside of work is pointless. I keep busy with extra shifts or little tasks because if I pay attention to that ache I don't know what to do next. I've tried mindfulness and similar things before; they just made the emptiness louder.

Therapist: The tightness in your chest makes sense. When that happens, what if you could notice that "I'm failing" thought, like a thought that shows up in the room — not because it's true, but because it is there?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When I try to notice the thought it just feels like I'm admitting I'm right — my chest tightens and I end up distracting myself with extra shifts or chores. Maybe once in a while naming it as "I'm failing" takes the edge off for a minute, but mostly it just sits there and I feel stuck. I'm not sure how noticing it changes anything, honestly.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make sense of that thought, like it's a puzzle you need to solve. What if, instead of trying to "fix" the thought, you could just let it be there — not as a problem to be solved, but as something in the room with you?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Letting it "be" just feels like admitting I'm useless — my chest tightens and it sits there like a weight. Sure, once in a while naming it as "I'm failing" takes the edge off for a minute, but mostly it just makes me want to disappear into another shift or a chore. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to make it stop — the chest tightness, the weight, the feeling of wanting to disappear. What if, instead of trying to make it stop, you could just notice what's possible for you when it's there, like a small part of you that's still showing up — even when the weight feels like it's pulling you down?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Noticing what's possible when the weight's there sounds nice in theory, but when I try it my chest tightens and it just feels like I'm pretending. I do keep showing up — I still do my job, check meds, keep patients safe — but that feels like survival, not something that tells me who I am, and I don't see how that changes the emptiness at night; I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm really struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to show up in your job as a way to cope with the emptiness, but that feels like it's not really you. What if, instead of trying to find a way to "be" when the weight is there, you could look at what matters to you about showing up at work? What is it about doing your job that feels important to you, even if it doesn't fill the emptiness?

Patient: What matters is that I keep people safe, that I'm dependable and competent — the small practical things, like getting meds right or catching a change in a patient, give me a thread of worth. But they feel like duties, not parts of me, and when the day ends the emptiness comes back and I don't see how knowing that changes anything. How is that supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like those small practical things do matter to you, but they feel like they're separate from what matters most. When the day ends, the emptiness comes back, and it feels like it's not connected to what matters. What if, instead of trying to change the emptiness, you could look at those small practical things as a thread of worth that's already there, even when the emptiness is there?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? Those duties — getting meds right, catching changes — maybe are threads, but they snap as soon as I get home and the same hollow comes back. My chest tightens thinking about it, and noticing hasn't stopped the nights from swallowing me; I've tried this before and it just highlights what's missing. Can we talk about something practical, like how to get through evenings without disappearing into work, or is this just another exercise in noticing I don't trust?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing hasn't helped with the nights. Let's talk about something practical: what happens when you're sitting with the emptiness, and you think about work. What's the smallest, most immediate action you could take — not to stop the emptiness, but just to make room for it while you're still sitting there — that might help you get through the evening.

Patient: I could do something tiny — make a cup of tea, sit in a chair by the window, set a 10‑minute timer and write down one small thing I did right today. How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried tiny rituals like that before and they only quiet the chest for a few minutes before the hollow comes back.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to fill the space with a tiny ritual, but it's not staying with you. What if, instead of trying to quiet the chest, the timer was just a way to make room for that emptiness while you were sitting there? So, even if the chest tightens, you could still write down that one small thing you did right today.

Patient: I could try the ten‑minute thing and write one small thing, I suppose — but how is that supposed to help? Usually it just dulls the chest for a few minutes and then the hollow comes back like clockwork. I'm willing to try, but I'm not convinced it's more than a bandage; what am I supposed to do when the timer stops and the emptiness is still there?

Therapist: It sounds like you're not sure what happens when the timer stops. What matters to you right now isn't that the timer stops, but that you're willing to sit with the emptiness, even when the chest is tight. What would you do with yourself, not to change the emptiness, but to be present with it, when you're sitting there with the timer stopped?

Patient: I guess I'd sit with my cup, read the one small thing I wrote, maybe put on a quiet song or fold a towel slowly and try to let the grief be there for a few minutes. But most nights I can't — I jump up and busy myself with chores because listening makes my chest tighten, so how is that supposed to help? I'm willing to try sitting when the timer stops, but I'm not convinced it won't just remind me of what's missing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that sitting with the emptiness will just remind you of what's missing. What if, instead of trying to change what's missing, you could focus on what you're doing while you're sitting there — folding the towel, listening to the song, reading the small thing you wrote? Could you make room for that small act, not because it would change the emptiness, but because it feels important to you right now?

Patient: I can try focusing on a small act—folding a towel, reading the note, playing a song—but how is that supposed to help when it just points out what's missing? Maybe if I think of those acts as proof I can still do something right, it won't feel like a lie, but I don't know—my chest tightens just thinking about it and I usually end up cleaning or taking another shift. If we're trying this, can we make it practical: what do I do in the moment my chest starts to pound and the urge to escape kicks in? I'm really struggling with that.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that focusing on small acts won't be enough to keep the emptiness at bay. What if, instead of trying to make the small act work, you focused on what happens when your chest starts to pound and the urge to escape kicks in? What would it feel like to notice that urge, without trying to stop it or change it?

Patient: When I try to notice the urge, my chest tightens, my hands go clammy, and this wave of shame and frustration hits me like I messed everything up — I feel small and I have to move. How is that supposed to help? Saying "notice it" has always just led me to escape — so what do I actually do in that exact moment the pounding starts (name it out loud? slow breaths? press my hand to my chest?), because I'm not doing abstract stuff, I need a step‑by‑step. I'm willing to try, but I'm really struggling and skeptical it won't just make the hollow louder.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the urge has led to escape in the past. What if, instead of trying to notice it, you could try to make room for it right where it is — even if it's hard to do that while your chest is pounding and your hands are clammy? What if you could try making one tiny move with your hand, even if it feels impossible? Like, what if you could just put your hand on your chest for a second, without trying to change it, just to make room for it?

Patient: I can try putting my hand on my chest for a second, but how is that supposed to help? Just thinking about it makes my chest tighten and this rush of shame and frustration hits me — I feel like I’ve messed up and want to get up. If we're doing this, tell me exactly what to do step‑by‑step: where to place my hand, whether to breathe in a certain way or count, how long to hold it, and what to do if the urge to escape starts. I'm skeptical, but I'll try if you guide me through it.

Therapist: I'll guide you through it step-by-step. Here's what I want you to try:

**Step 1: Notice your breath**. Just for a moment, notice what your breath is like right now. Is it rising and falling, or is it shallow? That's enough to notice. Don't try to change it yet.

**Step 2: Place your hand**. I want you to place your hand gently on your chest, right over the spot where your heart is beating. Not too hard, not too soft. Just a gentle touch. Hold it there for just a second.

**Step 3: Take a small breath in**. While your hand is on your chest, I want you to take a tiny breath in. Not a deep breath, just a small one. Try to breathe into your chest, not out of it. Just notice what happens when you breathe in that small way.

**Step 4: Hold the small breath**. Just hold that small breath for a second, while your hand is on your chest. Don't try to breathe out or change it. Just be with it.

**Step 5: Notice what happens**. When you hold that small breath and your hand is on your chest, what happens? Do you feel the urge to escape at all? If you do, what would it take for you to notice that urge without trying to stop it?

Patient: I tried doing it in my head just now — put my hand where my heart is, took the tiny breath like you said — and almost immediately my chest clenched harder, my hands went cold, and that rush of shame hit me like I’d failed at something huge. How is that supposed to help? I’ve tried these little exercises before and they just make the shame louder. 

If we’re going to do this, tell me exactly how long to hold my hand there and how long to hold the breath — count it out with me — and tell me what to do if the urge to get up and escape gets worse instead of better, because otherwise I’m just going to stand up and start cleaning or take another shift.

Therapist: It sounds like the exercise didn't work as you hoped, and that's okay. When you notice that shame and urge to escape, what if you could try something else? Instead of holding the hand on your chest for a certain amount of time, what if you could try holding it for just a second? Not because you have to make the shame go away, but because you want to notice what happens when you do hold your hand there.

As for the breath, what if you could try taking it in for just one second, and then letting it go? Not because you have to breathe deeply, but because you want to notice what happens when you breathe small. You can try counting with me: "One... second... breathe in... one... second... breathe out..."

Now, about what to do when the urge to escape gets worse: I want you to try something small. Not because you have to fix it, but because you want to notice what happens when you don't move. When you notice that urge to get up and escape, what's one tiny thing you could do instead of getting up? Could you just sit there for one more second, or take one more tiny breath?

Patient: Okay — I can try the one‑second thing, but how is that supposed to help? The moment I try to stay put the shame rushes in, my chest clenches and my hands go cold and I just want to bolt. 

If you're going to guide me, count it out with me — say "one" and I'll put my hand on my chest and hold for that one second. Then tell me exactly what tiny thing to do next instead of getting up (press my feet into the floor? squeeze my fingers? stay seated and breathe?). And if the urge gets worse during that second, do I keep counting, breathe, or something else? I'm skeptical, but I'll try if you walk me through it step‑by‑step.

Therapist: I'll guide you through it step-by-step. Here's what I want you to try:

"One... second... put your hand on your chest."

* Hold your hand there for just one second. Not because you have to make the shame go away, but because you want to notice what happens when you do hold your hand there.

"Now, what's one tiny thing you could do instead of getting up when you notice that urge to escape?"

Patient: I did it — put my hand on my chest for that one second like you said — and almost immediately my chest clenched harder, my hands went cold, and that rush of shame hit me like I'd flubbed something huge. How is that supposed to help? 

If I have to pick one tiny thing instead of getting up, I could press my feet firmly into the floor and squeeze my fingers together, then say out loud one small thing I did right today. I’ll try that if you count it out with me and tell me what to do if the urge to bolt gets worse while I’m holding it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold the hand on your chest for a second, and then you're looking for a tiny action to take instead of getting up. 

"One... second... put your hand on your chest." 

* Hold your hand there for just one second. 

"Now, notice what's happening when the urge to escape hits. What's one tiny thing you could do while you're holding your hand there, just to make room for it?" 

* When you say "one small thing I did right today," what if you could say it out loud right now, while your hand is still on your chest?

Patient: Okay — one small thing I did right today: I double‑checked a med and caught a mismatched dose. Saying it out loud actually makes my chest tighten and this old shame wells up, like I somehow shouldn't be proud. How is that supposed to help? 

I'll press my feet into the floor and squeeze my fingers like we said, but if the urge to bolt gets worse while I'm doing that, do I keep counting, say the line again, or do something else? Walk me through it step‑by‑step.

Therapist: It sounds like the tiny action of saying "I double-checked a med and caught a mismatched dose" is actually making the shame worse. That's okay. What matters is that you're trying to make room for it, even if it feels like the opposite of what you want.

"One... second... put your hand on your chest." 

* Hold your hand there for just one second.

"Now, notice what's happening when you press your feet into the floor and squeeze your fingers. What if, instead of trying to stop the urge to bolt, you just kept doing those tiny actions, even if it feels like they're not working?

Patient: Okay — I'll try keeping the tiny actions, but I need you to be concrete. My chest already tightened just thinking about it and that old shame washes over me like I’ve failed at something big, so tell me exactly: count with me out loud to five while I press my feet into the floor and squeeze my fingers; how many times do I say the line out loud, and what do I do if the urge to bolt gets louder while we're counting? How is that supposed to help, honestly — it feels like just delaying the inevitable, but I'll do it if you walk me through it step‑by‑step.

Therapist: I'll guide you through it step-by-step.

"One... second... put your hand on your chest."

* Hold your hand there for just one second.

"Now, I want you to press your feet into the floor and squeeze your fingers. I'll count with you out loud to five: 

"One... Two... Three... Four... Five."

* As you count, I want you to say "I double-checked a med and caught a mismatched dose" out loud, just once, at the end of the count: "I double-checked a med and caught a mismatched dose."

* If the urge to bolt gets louder while we're counting, I want you to notice it exactly as you feel it. Don't try to stop it or change it. Just notice what's happening in your body and mind.

This isn't about delaying the inevitable. It's about making room for what matters to you right now.

Patient: I did it — hand on my chest, feet pressed into the floor, fingers squeezed, and we counted to five; I said, "I double-checked a med and caught a mismatched dose" at the end. Right away my chest clenched, my hands went cold, and that old shame flooded me so hard I nearly bolted, though I stayed seated until the count finished. I felt a tiny flicker of something, but mostly the hollow's still there — how is that supposed to help long‑term, and what do I do if the urge spikes worse in the middle of the count next time? I'm really struggling and skeptical this won't just make the shame louder.

Therapist: It sounds like you did the exercise, even when it felt really tough. That's a huge step.

The tiny flicker you felt might be worth noticing. What if, instead of trying to push it away or make it bigger, you could try to hold onto that tiny spark for just a second? Not because you have to do anything with it, but because it's showing up in your body.

As for the shame, it's okay that it's still there. It's not going away because of this exercise. But what matters is that you're willing to show up with it, even when it feels overwhelming. If the urge spikes worse in the middle of the count next time, I want you to notice what happens exactly. Don't try to stop it or change it. Just notice what's happening in your body and mind.

When you notice that urge, I want you to try something new. Instead of pressing your feet into the floor and squeezing your fingers, what if you just let your hands rest for a second? Not because you have to make the shame go away, but because you're curious about what happens when you don't try to push it.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When I even think about not doing something — just letting my hands rest — my chest tightens, shame floods in like that old failure again, and I want to leap up and busy myself. I'm willing to try, but tell me exactly what to notice in that one second and what to do if the urge to bolt or the shame spikes (count? breathe? keep still?), because otherwise I just end up cleaning or taking another shift.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of letting your hands rest is already triggering the same shame and urge to escape.

When you notice that thought "I need to let my hands rest" and your chest is tightening, shame is flooding in, and you feel the urge to bolt... I want you to notice exactly what's happening in that moment, without trying to change it.

Here's what I want you to do: notice the sensation of your feet on the floor, not the urge to bolt. Just notice the feeling of your feet touching the ground, the sensation of the floor beneath you. 

That's it. Just notice that sensation for a second, without trying to change it or push it away.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? When I even try to notice my feet, my chest tightens, sweat comes on my hands, and this wave of shame and frustration floods me like I’ve failed at something — I want to bolt. I'm willing to try, but be concrete: how many seconds do I focus on the feeling, do I count or breathe, and what exactly do I do if the urge to get up gets worse while I'm noticing? I'm really struggling here.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet is already triggering the same physical sensations and emotional response.

I want to give you a specific instruction that might feel really small, but could be helpful. For the next 30 seconds, I want you to focus on noticing the sensation of the sweat on your hands, not the urge to bolt. Just notice the sensation of the sweat, the feeling of it on your skin, the way it might be dripping down.

If the urge to get up gets worse while you're noticing the sweat, I want you to notice that urge exactly, without trying to change it. But here's the thing: I don't want you to try to push it away or make it go away. Instead, I want you to notice that it's happening, right there, in this moment. You can say to yourself, "I notice the urge to get up, and it's still here, even though I'm noticing the sweat."

That's it. Just notice the sweat, the urge to get up, and the feeling of your feet on the floor, for 30 seconds.

Patient: I tried that for a few seconds — focused on the sweat, my feet, like you said — and it just slammed that shame back into my chest, like that old failure's sitting there again. How is that supposed to help? My hands went cold and I almost bolted before the thirty seconds were up.

If we're actually going to do this, be concrete: count me through the thirty seconds out loud, tell me exactly what to say if the urge spikes, and what to do if I feel like I'm going to get up mid‑way. I need a short script I can repeat, step‑by‑step, because otherwise I won't trust it won't just make the shame louder.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the sweat didn't help, and the shame came back in. That's okay. 

Let's try something different. For the next 30 seconds, I want you to focus on the sensation of the shame in your chest, not the urge to bolt. I want you to notice it exactly, like it's a physical sensation in your body. 

Here's what I want you to do: I'll count with you out loud. When I say "one", I want you to say "I notice the shame in my chest". When I say "two", I want you to say "it's still here". When I say "three", I want you to say "I'm noticing it". 

Here we go: 

"One... I notice the shame in my chest."

"Two... it's still here."

"Three... I'm noticing it."

If the urge to get up spikes while we're counting, I want you to notice it exactly. But here's the thing: I don't want you to try to push it away. Instead, I want you to say "I notice the urge to get up" and then just keep counting. Don't stop. Just keep noticing. 

And if you feel like you're going to get up mid-way, I want you to notice that feeling too. But here's what I want you to do: I want you to take one small step back from the urge. Just take a deep breath, and say "I'm still noticing the shame".

Patient: I tried it — I said those lines as you counted in my head, and it just slammed that shame into my chest like that old failure sitting there. My hands went cold and I nearly bolted. 

How is that supposed to help? If the urge spikes mid‑count, tell me exactly what to do step‑by‑step: keep saying the next line, take a breath, press my feet, or something else? Give me a short script (exact words and pacing) and a clear fallback if I feel like getting up, because I'm willing to try but I need you to walk me through it word‑for‑word — I'm really skeptical otherwise.

Therapist: It sounds like saying those lines while counting didn't help. That's okay. 

When the urge spikes mid-count, I want you to do this:

"One... I notice the shame in my chest."

"Two... it's still here."

*Hold the "three" for a second*

"Three... I notice the urge to get up."

*Take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth*

"Four... I'm still noticing the shame."

*Notice your feet on the floor, and press down gently*

This script is designed to help you stay with the shame, notice the urge to get up, and then take a small step back from it. 

If you feel like getting up mid-way, here's what to do:

*Notice the feeling of your feet leaving the floor*

"Three... I notice my feet are leaving the floor."

*Take a deep breath in, and say to yourself*

"I'm still noticing the shame."

*Press your feet back down onto the floor*

This fallback is designed to help you come back to the present moment, and notice that you're still feeling the shame. It's not about getting up, but about staying where you are, and noticing what's happening.

Patient: I tried picturing it and that old shame slammed into my chest like always — I feel small and like I’ve messed up everything. How is that supposed to help? 

If we're doing this now, count me through it word‑for‑word and slowly: say "one" (I put my hand on my chest), pause two seconds, "two" (I say "it's still here"), pause two seconds, "three" (I say "I notice the urge to get up"), then guide one slow in‑and‑out breath (tell me seconds), and "four" (press feet down), "five" (say the line again). Tell me exactly how many seconds for each pause and what exact line to say if I feel like bolting mid‑count — I'm willing to try but only if you walk me through it step‑by‑step right now.

Therapist: It sounds like picturing the process didn't help. That's okay.

Here's what I want you to do:

"One... *pause for 2 seconds* Put your hand on your chest."

*Wait for 2 seconds*

"Two... *pause for 2 seconds* Say 'It's still here' out loud."

*Wait for 2 seconds*

"Three... *pause for 2 seconds* Say 'I notice the urge to get up' out loud."

*Wait for 2 seconds*

"Now, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4... *pause for 4 seconds*... and out through your mouth for a count of 4... *pause for 4 seconds*."

*Wait for 8 seconds*

"Four... *pause for 1 second* Press your feet down gently onto the floor."

*Wait for 1 second*

"Five... *pause for 1 second* Say 'I notice the urge to get up' out loud again, and take a deep breath in."

When you feel like bolting mid-count, just wait for the pause after "Three" and say "I notice the urge to get up" when you're ready. Don't try to push it away. Just notice it, and then keep going.

Patient: I tried picturing it and that old failure slammed into my chest again — I feel small and useless and like I have to get up. How is that supposed to help? 

Alright — I'll try if you actually count me through it right now, slowly and out loud. Start when you're ready: say "One" (pause 2s) then tell me the exact phrase to say, then "Two" (pause 2s) and so on — and if I feel like bolting mid-count, tell me the single sentence to say and the exact action (press feet? breathe?) so I can do it. I'm skeptical but will try if you guide me word‑for‑word.

Therapist: It sounds like picturing the process didn't help. That's okay.

Here we go: 

"One... *pause for 2 seconds*"

Put your hand on your chest.

"Two... *pause for 2 seconds*"

Say "It's still here" out loud.

"Three... *pause for 2 seconds*"

Say "I notice the urge to get up" out loud.

*Wait for 6 seconds*

Now, take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for a count of 4... *pause for 4 seconds*... and out through your mouth for a count of 4... *pause for 4 seconds*.

*Wait for 8 seconds*

"Four... *pause for 1 second*"

Press your feet down gently onto the floor.

*Wait for 1 second*

"Five... *pause for 1 second*"

Say "I notice the urge to get up" out loud again, and take a deep breath in.

If you feel like getting up mid-count, just say "I notice the urge to get up" and press your feet down onto the floor.

Patient: I did it with you — hand on my chest, said the lines, the breath, pressed my feet — and it hit me hard: my chest clenched, shame flooded in, I almost bolted though I stayed. How is that supposed to help long‑term? 

If I'm going to keep doing this, tell me exactly what to do next when the shame doesn't ease after the five — do I repeat the whole thing, keep saying the line, or move on to something else? I'm skeptical because I've tried this before and it mostly just points out how much I've messed up, so be concrete: give me a 30‑second script I can actually use when the urge spikes again.
