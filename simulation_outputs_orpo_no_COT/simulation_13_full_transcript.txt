--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Um, I guess I've been feeling really stuck and directionless since the move — like my sense of self is mostly just “I'm the teacher” and I don't know what else matters to me. It's making my anxiety worse, and I don't really know where to start talking about it. I don't know, it's hard to explain.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: When that "I'm the teacher" story shows up, what happens in your body when you try to make sense of it, like you're trying to find a way to fix the feeling of being stuck?

Patient: I guess my chest gets tight and my shoulders tense up, like I’m bracing for something. My breathing gets shallow and my stomach knots, and then my head kind of goes fuzzy so I can't think straight. I don't know, it's uncomfortable to sit with, so... can we not dig too deep into that yet?


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that "I'm the teacher" story is already creating a strong physical experience, even just noticing it. When you notice your chest getting tight and your head going fuzzy, what happens if you could make space for that feeling *while* trying to imagine what matters to you as a teacher?

Patient: I guess if I try to make space for it, the tightness just gets louder and my head fills up with work stuff — lesson plans, grading, not making mistakes. When I try to imagine what matters to me as a teacher, all I can see is the job and not much else, and then I feel kind of blank. I don't know, it's really uncomfortable to go deeper right now — can we slow down or stick to something practical for a bit?


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like trying to make space for that feeling is actually making it harder to notice what matters to you as a teacher. Let's try something small. When you're grading papers, what would it be like to notice the paper *as paper*, not as something that needs to be graded perfectly?

Patient: I guess if I actually try that, I notice the texture, the faint pencil smudges, the little creases — it's kind of grounding and my shoulders ease a bit for a moment. But then my brain snaps to deadlines and whether I'm behind, so I can't stay with it long. I don't know, can we keep this practical — like a quick thing I could do in the middle of grading to stay with the paper for a bit?


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: The moment your brain snaps to deadlines is like a small wave. What if, while you notice the texture and smudges, you made a tiny choice to *keep looking at the paper* for just 5 seconds longer, before moving on to the next task?

Patient: I guess I could try that. It feels a bit silly, but when I actually do it my shoulders ease for those few seconds and my head clears a little. I don't know if I'll remember in the moment — maybe I'll put a tiny sticky note on my desk or set a quick 5‑second timer on my phone? Can we keep this practical, though? I'm already a bit... overwhelmed.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: Having a reminder can be helpful. What if, when you put that sticky note or set the timer, you didn't make a plan to *fix* the feeling when it comes back, but just noticed what happens when you make space for it for those few seconds?

Patient: I don't know, it feels weird not trying to fix it — like I'm letting things be messy. But I guess I could try the sticky note idea, maybe something like "5 sec — notice" or a tiny timer on my phone and see what happens. When I do it my shoulders do ease, but then I worry I'm just procrastinating on the real work. Can you help me come up with a short, non‑annoying reminder phrase that I might actually use?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're worried you're just avoiding the real work. What if your reminder phrase was more about noticing the moment, rather than fixing it? Instead of "5 sec — notice", what if it was just "5 sec"?

Patient: I guess "5 sec" actually feels... less pushy, so I might actually use it, but I worry I'll still tell myself I'm avoiding real work. I don't know, maybe something a bit more grounding would help — like "just look," "breathe 5," or even a tiny dot sticker to focus on. Can we come up with one short phrase that won't annoy me so I'll actually do it?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: When you try to tell yourself you're avoiding real work, it sounds like you're already caught up in that story. What if your reminder phrase was just about *noticing* what's already showing up, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know… maybe something really plain like "notice" or "just notice" would work — it doesn't feel like a command to fix anything. I guess "5 sec" could help when I'm in a rush, but I'm worried it'll feel annoying. Can you help me pick one short phrase that would actually fit on a tiny sticky note and not make me roll my eyes?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: That "notice" phrase feels really simple and gentle. What if, when you put it on your sticky note, you just looked at it for a moment, without trying to use it or make it do anything for you?

Patient: I guess I could try that — just look at it for a moment without trying to make it mean anything. It feels awkward and like I'm avoiding real work, but when I actually do it my shoulders ease for a bit and my head clears. I don't know, can we keep it simple — help me pick between "notice" and "5 sec" so I won't roll my eyes at it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that both options have value for you. When you look at them side by side, what feels lighter – noticing the moment or using the "5 sec" timer?

Patient: I guess "notice" feels lighter — it's quieter and doesn't feel like an order. "5 sec" might help when I'm rushing, but it already sounds a bit bossy. I don't know, can we go with "notice" for now and keep "5 sec" as a backup?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: "Notice" feels like a gentle anchor for you. What if, when you notice the paper, you didn't have to decide what to do with it right away?

Patient: I guess that actually sounds kind of relieving — like letting the paper be for a moment instead of forcing a choice. I don't know if I can do it without feeling guilty or like I'm procrastinating, but maybe I could try it once while grading tomorrow and see what happens. Can we keep it practical and maybe plan one tiny time to practice?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try it with a small commitment. What if tomorrow, while grading, you noticed the paper for just 30 seconds, without making a choice or worrying about procrastination?

Patient: I guess I could try that — just 30 seconds while grading tomorrow, letting the paper be without deciding what to do. It already feels a bit guilty and weird, like I'm avoiding work, so maybe I'll put the "notice" sticky on my desk and set a quiet 30‑second timer on my phone so I don't have to think about it. I don't know, I'm a bit overwhelmed about actually doing it — can we walk through one tiny, exact step I can take right before I start grading so it feels doable?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the guilt and weirdness are making it hard to take that first step. What if, right before you start grading, you could just place the sticky note on your desk *before* you even think about grading?

Patient: I guess I could try that — I'll put the "notice" sticky on the top-right corner of my desk before I touch any papers. Right before I start, I'll take one slow breath, look at the sticky for a moment, then start the 30‑second timer. I don't know, it still feels awkward and like I'll forget — can you help me make that sequence even simpler so I actually do it?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're almost there. What if, right before you start grading, you just said to yourself: "I put the sticky note on my desk. Now I take one slow breath..."

Patient: I guess I can try saying that: "I put the sticky note on my desk. Now I take one slow breath..." Then start the 30‑second timer. It feels awkward and I already worry it's just procrastinating — could we make it even smaller, like just the one breath and save the timer for later? I don't know, I'm already a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really close to making that tiny step. What if you just focused on *that one breath*? "I take one slow breath..."

Patient: Okay. I take one slow breath... I guess when I actually do it my shoulders drop a bit, my chest eases, and my head gets a little less fuzzy. I don't know — it feels awkward and like I'm avoiding things, but maybe I can start with that.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that one breath brought a tiny bit of ease. When you notice your shoulders dropping and your chest easing, what happens to the feeling of avoiding things for just a moment?

Patient: I guess when I notice my shoulders drop the urge to avoid quiets down for a second and the guilt eases a bit, like there's a little gap where I don't have to do anything. Then my brain notices the gap and fills it with “you should be working” or “this is procrastination,” and the old tension comes back. I don't know, it's awkward and I don't want to get stuck on feeling weird—can we keep this practical and figure out one tiny thing to do when that guilt creeps back?

Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing how that gap gets filled with those thoughts. What if, when you notice that gap, you could say to yourself: "I notice that thought. I don't have to fix it."

Patient: I don't know... I guess saying that helps for a beat, but then my brain's already yelling that I have to fix it and I get jumpy and can't concentrate. It feels messy and I don't want to sit in it — can we come up with one tiny, practical thing I can do right when that "fix it" voice shows up?


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to pause the jumpy feeling. What if, when that "fix it" voice shows up, you could simply *look at the paper* again, without trying to change it?

Patient: I don't know... I guess looking at the paper might help, but when that "fix it" voice starts my heart races and my hands get shaky so I can't focus. Maybe I could pick one tiny detail — like a corner or a smudge — and look at it for five slow counts. I'm feeling kind of jumpy right now; could that be the exact thing I try when the voice shows up?


--- Turn 18 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 18]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try that tiny detail when the jumpy feeling shows up. What if, when your heart races and your hands shake, you simply looked at *that one smudge* for those five slow counts, without trying to fix it?

Patient: I guess I can try that — look at the smudge for five slow counts. My hands already feel shaky and my chest is racing, so I don't know if I can do five; could we make it even smaller, like two slow counts? It feels like a lot to ask right now.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling the overwhelm. What if, when the voice shows up and your heart is racing, you just looked at *that one smudge* for *one* slow count?

Patient: I guess I can try that — just look at the smudge for one slow count. My hands are shaking and my chest's tight, so it might only be a second, but I'll try. I don't know if it'll help… can we do a quick practice now?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to try it. Let's do it right now, while we're still talking. Take one slow breath in... and look at *that one smudge* for just one second.

Patient: Okay... I took the slow breath and looked at the smudge for one slow count. My shoulders eased a tiny bit and my chest felt a hair less tight, but then my brain jumped back to “you should be working” and my hands started to tremble again. I don't know — can we try one more like that, or do something just as small so it doesn't feel like I'm wasting time?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that tiny moment of easing didn't quite last. What if, instead of trying to make it last, you just noticed when your brain jumped back to "you should be working"?

Patient: I guess when I notice my brain jump back, there's this quick spike of guilt and I just freeze up. Saying "that's the should voice" might help for a beat, but then I start listing everything I haven't done and it gets worse. I don't know — can we try it now? I'll say "that's the should voice," then look at the smudge for one slow count. My energy's low, so short and simple would work.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try it. When you notice the should voice, what if you simply said "that's the should voice" *before* looking at the smudge for one slow count?

Patient: Okay... I'll try. "That's the should voice." Then I looked at the smudge for one slow count — my shoulders eased a little, but the guilt and the lists came back right away. I don't know, can we do it one more time? I'm feeling kind of foggy.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the lists came back quickly. What if, when you notice the lists, you just looked at *the smudge* again for one slow count?

Patient: I guess... okay. "That's the list voice." Then I looked at the smudge for one slow count. My shoulders eased a little, but the lists rushed back right away. I don't know—could we try one tiny, practical step after that, like naming one small next thing I can do so it doesn't spiral? I'm feeling kind of foggy.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the lists are still coming back. What if, when you notice the lists rushing back, you could simply *name* one small thing you could do next, like "I could make a cup of tea" or "I could take a few deep breaths"?

Patient: I guess I could make a cup of tea — something small and concrete I can actually do right now. I don't know if it'll help the lists, I'm feeling kind of foggy and jumpy, but maybe that minute will stop the spiral.


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try that small step. What if, when you make that cup of tea, you noticed *how your body felt* for just one moment before you took a sip?

Patient: I don't know... I guess I could try that — just notice how my shoulders, chest, and hands feel for one beat before I sip. I'm feeling foggy and jumpy so it seems hard, but maybe it'll slow the lists for a moment. Could you guide me through one quick practice now?
