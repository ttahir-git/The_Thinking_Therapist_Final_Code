Patient: I'm an accountant and lately I've been having a lot of trouble managing anger and frustration, especially when it comes to money, bills, or people who don't get how stressed I am. I also have OCD, which seems to make the reactions worse, and often tiny things set me off and then I just shut down. I guess I'm... overwhelmed.

Therapist: When you say "overwhelmed," what happens in your body when that thought shows up – like a knot in your chest or your mind racing – right now, while we're talking about it?

Patient: My chest tightens and there's this knot in my stomach, and my jaw gets really tense—my hands go a bit clammy sometimes. My breathing gets shallow and my mind starts racing with worst-case money thoughts, and I can't focus; I don't know, it just feels like everything's closing in. I guess I usually try to distract myself or shut down when that happens.

Therapist: Those physical sensations can be really intense. When you try to distract yourself or shut down, what happens to the "I'm overwhelmed" thought then – does it stay present, or does it move out of your awareness for a little while?

Patient: I guess it sort of moves out of my awareness for a little while if I throw myself into work or scroll my phone, but it doesn't really go away — it just sits under the surface and then comes back louder later. I don't know, sometimes it feels like I shove it down into this tightness in my chest and jaw, and then a bill or a comment from someone makes it spike again.

Therapist: It sounds like that "tightness" in your chest and jaw is connected to the feeling of being "stuck" with the thought "I'm overwhelmed." When a bill or someone's comment makes it spike again, what matters most to you – would you be willing to try noticing that tightness while you're still working on your work or scrolling through your phone, just for a tiny moment, without trying to push it away or distract yourself?

Patient: I don't know. I guess I could try noticing it for a tiny bit, but it feels really scary — I get antsy and my first instinct is to grab my phone or dive into work. Maybe start really small, like 20–30 seconds, because anything longer and I just want to run away.

Therapist: You might notice that feeling of being "scared" right there with the tightness – it's like a little voice saying "don't do that." What if, while you're trying to notice it for those 20–30 seconds, you could say to that voice "I see you're here" – just a simple acknowledgment of its presence?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try, but it feels really weird and kind of stupid to say that out loud. Saying "I see you're here" might just make me more anxious and want to run, so could we maybe just do the 20 seconds of breathing first? I'm not great at this, so... yeah.

Therapist: We can start with the 20 seconds of breathing. When you take that one breath in, what happens to the tightness in your chest and jaw – does it stay the same, or does it feel a tiny bit different?

Patient: I don't know — when I take that one breath it sort of loosens for a second, like the knot eases a tiny bit, but my jaw stays tight and it creeps back. I guess it helps a little if I keep breathing, but I'm already getting antsy just talking about it.

Therapist: It sounds like the 20 seconds is helping a tiny bit, even if it's not enough to make the knot completely go away. That might be enough to try again, even if you're getting a little anxious. Would you be willing to take one more 20-second breath, and see what happens when you do?

Patient: Okay, I guess I'll try one more 20‑second breath. When I breathe in and out it loosens the knot a little and my shoulders drop, but my jaw stays clamped and my mind keeps jumping to bills and what could go wrong — I get antsy halfway through. I don't know, can we slow down? It's getting a bit overwhelming.

Therapist: It sounds like that knot loosening a little and your shoulders dropping is a tiny bit of progress, even if it doesn't last. And when you get antsy halfway through, it's like the "what could go wrong" story starts to show up again. 

Before we stop, I want to check in with you one more time: what matters most to you about doing this work – even if it's just for a tiny 20 seconds – is that you want to feel more connected to what's going on inside, or is there something else that matters to you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess what matters most is not feeling so hijacked by money stuff; I want to stop getting so angry or shutting down when bills or people push on that. I want to be able to talk about finances without my chest knotting and my jaw clenching so I can actually make clearer decisions instead of panicking. But I'm struggling to see how breathing or this talking helps — can we look at some concrete things I can do in the moment, like during a tense phone call? I'm already getting a bit anxious bringing this up.

Therapist: It sounds like you're craving more than just a calm feeling – you want to be able to take action with clarity. When you're on that phone call and the knot shows up, what's one tiny thing you could do with your jaw still clamped and your mind racing, but your breathing still steady – just one small action that might help you connect with what matters in that moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess one tiny thing is to put the call on speaker or ask to be put on hold, rest my hand on the desk, and take three slow breaths so I can unclench my jaw a bit before answering. That gives me a second to slow my thoughts and say something clearer instead of snapping or freezing. I'm kind of anxious about sounding weak or unprofessional if I do that, though.

Therapist: It sounds like that tiny action – putting the call on speaker, taking a breath, and resting your hand on the desk – feels like it could help you connect with what matters in that moment, even if it doesn't sound "strong" or "professional" to your mind. What matters to you about what you say on that phone call – is it about getting the bill paid, or is it about showing up for the person on the other end?

Patient: I don't know — I guess mostly it's about getting the bill sorted without making things worse or missing something important. I also don't want to snap at the person on the other end, so I want to stay calm enough to ask clear questions, but I get defensive fast. Can we talk about specific phrases I could use on those calls so I don't sound weak?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to connect with the person on the other end while also keeping yourself safe – wanting to ask clear questions without sounding weak. 

Let's try a small experiment: when you're on that call and you feel yourself getting defensive, what's one phrase that might help you pause and stay connected – just one word or phrase that could help you breathe into it?

Patient: I don't know — maybe something like "Give me a second" or "Can you hold for a moment?" I guess it feels kind of dumb and awkward, like I might sound weak, so could you help me come up with a few other short, more professional-sounding options?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about sounding weak, but you want to stay connected with the person on the other end. Here are a few short, more professional-sounding options that might help you pause and ask for a moment:

*   "That's a great point, let me just clarify..."
*   "I need to make sure I understand that correctly..."
*   "Can you walk me through that again?"
*   "I'm not sure I've got all the details, can you help me out?"

These phrases are designed to be brief, yet helpful. They also give you a chance to take a breath and collect your thoughts before responding.

Patient: I don't know — those actually feel... okay, I guess. I'm still worried they'll make me sound unsure or weak. Can we try a quick role‑play where I practice one, or could you give me a couple super‑short alternatives I could use quietly in my head instead of saying out loud?

Therapist: Let's try a quick role-play with a real phone call scenario. I'll be the person on the other end, and you can practice using one of those phrases. If you're still worried about sounding unsure or weak, I can also give you a couple super-short alternatives you can use quietly in your head.

Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with a friend or family member who's asking about your finances. They're concerned about the bills and want to know if everything is okay. You feel defensive and want to explain, but you're worried about sounding weak.

What would you like to do?

Patient: I don't know — can we start with me practicing it quietly in my head first? Maybe I'll try "Give me a second" or "Let me make sure I understand" silently, and then if that feels okay I can try saying one out loud. I'm already getting kind of anxious about doing this.

Therapist: That's a great idea to start with it quietly in your head first. Here's what that might look like:

*   Imagine you're on that phone call and you feel the defensiveness rising up.
*   Silently say to yourself, "Give me a second" or "Let me make sure I understand."
*   Notice how that phrase feels in your body. Is it like a knot in your stomach or a lump in your throat?
*   If it feels okay, you can try saying it out loud. What would it sound like to say "Give me a second" or "Let me make sure I understand" to your friend or family member?

Try it with a friend or family member who's not in a place where they might get upset if you practice it with them.

Patient: I don't know — I don't think I'm ready to try it with someone else yet. I guess can we keep role‑playing here a bit more, where you say the concerned lines and I try saying "Give me a second" out loud? I'm already pretty anxious about sounding weird.

Therapist: Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with a friend or family member who's concerned about the bills and wants to know if everything is okay. They're worried that you might miss something important if you don't get the bill paid on time.

You feel defensive and want to explain, but you're worried about sounding weak. What would you like to do?

Go ahead and try saying "Give me a second" out loud.

Patient: Okay... Give me a second. I said it, but my voice was kind of shaky and my jaw's still locked — I don't know, it felt stupid and awkward. Can we try again with you pushing a bit harder, like actually pressuring me about a late bill, so I can practice saying it when I'm more on edge?

Therapist: Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with your landlord, and they're pressuring you about the overdue rent. They're saying that if you don't pay it by the end of the week, you'll lose your apartment.

You feel defensive and want to explain, but you're worried about sounding weak. Your landlord is saying, "We need to talk about the rent. It's really late, and we're going to have to evict you if you don't pay it. Can you tell me what's going on?"

What would you like to do?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd try something short and low like, "I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?" My voice would probably be shaky and my jaw's locked, so I'd ask them to hold while I check my options. Can we role‑play that one more time but quieter?

Therapist: Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with your landlord, and they're pressuring you about the overdue rent. They're saying that if you don't pay it by the end of the week, you'll lose your apartment.

You feel defensive and want to explain, but you're worried about sounding weak. Your landlord is saying, "We need to talk about the rent. It's really late, and we're going to have to evict you if you don't pay it. Can you tell me what's going on?"

*   You feel a knot in your stomach, but you want to respond.
*   You say, "I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?"
*   Your voice is shaking slightly, but you're asking them to hold while you check your options.

Try saying it out loud while keeping the volume low.

Patient: Okay... "I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?" I don't know — that felt kind of flat and awkward. Can we try it again with you pushing harder? I guess I need more practice.

Therapist: Let's try again. Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with your landlord, and they're pressuring you about the overdue rent. They're saying that if you don't pay it by the end of the week, you'll lose your apartment.

Patient: "Okay... 'I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?'

I said it quiet, but it felt humiliating — my voice cracked and this heat of shame came over me and I just wanted to disappear. I don't know, I guess I need more practice with someone putting more pressure so I can try to stay steady.

Therapist: Let's try again. Here's the scenario:

You're on a phone call with your landlord, and they're pressuring you about the overdue rent. They're saying that if you don't pay it by the end of the week, you'll lose your apartment.

*   You feel a knot in your stomach, but you want to respond.
*   You take a deep breath and say, "I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?"

Try saying it out loud while keeping the volume low.

Patient: "I hear you. I need a moment to sort this out; can we discuss a payment plan?"

It came out quiet and cracked and that hot shame hit me so hard I wanted to disappear. I don't know — can we try a firmer, shorter line instead, or could you role‑play less harsh so I can practice without feeling crushed? I'm getting pretty drained and need it slower.

Therapist: Let's try a firmer, shorter line. Here's an example:

"Okay, I hear you. I'll make a payment plan. When do I need to pay it by?"

This line is direct and shows that you're willing to take action. It's also shorter and less open-ended, which might help you feel less overwhelmed.

If you'd like to practice with less harsh language, we could try this scenario again with a gentler tone. Here's an example:

"Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent. Can we figure out a plan for how I'll pay it by the end of the week? What would that look like for you?"

This line is still direct, but it's phrased in a more collaborative way. It shows that you're willing to work together to find a solution.

Try saying it out loud and see how it feels.

Patient: "Okay, I hear you. I'll make a payment plan. When do I need to pay it by?"

Saying that felt a bit firmer, but my throat's still tight and this hot shame — like that old failure feeling — came back and wiped me out. I don't know, can we try the gentler version again, slower? I guess I need more practice; it's getting kind of draining.

Therapist: Let's try the gentler version again, slower. Here's an example:

"Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent. *pause* Can you help me understand what you need from me? *pause* What would make it easier for you to trust that I'll pay the rent?"

This time, I'm using more pauses to give you space to breathe. I'm also asking you to help me understand what you need, which can help you feel more in control.

Try saying it out loud and see how it feels.

Patient: Okay... "Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent. Can you help me understand what you need from me? What would make it easier for you to trust that I'll pay the rent?"

I said it quiet and it felt empty — my chest tightened and that shame came back, like I messed up again. I don't know, can we slow down and just practice the first sentence a few times? I guess the rest feels like too much right now.

Therapist: Let's focus on the first sentence: "Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent."

Try saying it out loud a few times, just for a moment:

"Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent."

*   Take a deep breath and say it again: "Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent."
*   Pause for a moment, and then say it again: "Hey, I know we need to talk about the rent."

Notice how it feels to say those words.

Patient: I said it a few times and it felt hollow—my throat clenched and that hot shame came back and I just wanted to disappear. I don't know, it makes me freeze and I feel kind of drained; can we slow it down and do the first sentence one more time, with a breath before I say it? Maybe just that one line again, please.
