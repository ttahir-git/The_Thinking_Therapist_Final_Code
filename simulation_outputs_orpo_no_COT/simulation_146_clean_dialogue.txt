Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this loop of harsh self-criticism — I fixate on perceived failures and keep telling myself I'm not good enough. I'm an older student and I've always had to do things on my own, so asking for help feels awkward, and a recent health scare has made my social anxiety worse. I don't know, it's just been really heavy.

Therapist: It sounds like having to navigate this alone for a long time has made it hard for you to trust that asking for help is okay. When that health scare showed up, what happened when you tried to reach out to someone for support — even if it felt small or awkward?

Patient: I tried to call a couple of people — I think I called my sister once but I hung up before she picked up. I don't know, I guess I just felt like I'd be bothering them or that I should be able to handle it myself. After that I mostly withdrew and told myself I messed up by not handling it better.

Therapist: The thought that you'd be bothering others seems to be really stuck for you — like it's a weight that matters. When you hung up that call, what happened to that feeling in your body after you stopped talking — was it like it got quieter, or did it stay there?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest tightened and there was this knot in my stomach, and it didn't really go away. After that I kind of shut down and distracted myself with busywork, telling myself I shouldn't have needed to call at all.

Therapist: That knot in your chest and the distraction — it sounds like they helped you move away from the feeling of needing help. What would happen in that moment if you were to notice that knot, and instead of pushing it away, you just made room for it to be there?

Patient: I don't know — it's really uncomfortable to sit with that. I guess at first it would feel bigger, like I'd want to run, but maybe if I let it be it could ease up somehow. Can we talk about concrete ways I could try that, like what to do or say when the knot shows up or if I try calling someone again?

Therapist: Notice that you're willing to try it even though it feels uncomfortable. When the knot shows up in that moment of needing to call someone, what's one tiny thing you could do with your body that feels connected to making room for it? Like, could you sit with your feet on the ground, or breathe in deeply?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd try to put my feet flat on the floor and take a slow, deep breath, maybe rest my hand on my belly. It feels kind of silly, but focusing on the breath might keep me from panicking and give me a second to actually make the call.

Therapist: Noticing what's "silly" about that feeling, but still trying it — that's a small step. When you're ready to make that call, what's one small thing you could say to yourself that matters, just for that moment? Like, "I'm choosing to reach out because..."?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd tell myself something small like, "It's okay to ask for help; I don't have to do this alone right now." Saying that feels awkward, but maybe it would stop me from hanging up.

Therapist: Noticing that small phrase matters to you — it's what keeps you from hanging up. When you say that to yourself, what's one tiny action you could take next that feels connected to reaching out for help? Like, could you dial that number, or write a text to your sister?

Patient: I guess I could send a short text — something like, "Hey, I'm having a rough day, can we talk later?" — or even just "Can I call you?" I’d probably draft it first, sit with my feet on the floor, take a slow breath, then send it. I'm nervous about whether they'll reply though, and I don't know, it still feels awkward.

Therapist: Drafting that text ahead of time — that's a big step. When you send it and then sit with your feet on the floor, what would happen if you noticed the nervousness about their reply, but didn't let it stop you from staying connected with your sister?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I'd try to keep my feet planted and breathe, and that might be enough to actually send the text. If they reply I’d feel relieved and awkwardly glad, but if they don't I’ll probably retreat, start telling myself I shouldn't have reached out, and get stuck again.

Therapist: Noticing what would happen even if they don't reply — that takes courage. If you could stay with the feeling of relief when they do reply, and the awkwardness when they don't, what might it mean for you to make space for those sensations, even if they're hard?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it might mean I'm learning that feelings don't have to be fixed right away, like relief and awkwardness can both just... be there without me doing anything. It might also mean I'm allowed to not handle everything perfectly, though that feels really uncomfortable, so can we talk about a couple of tiny, practical things I could try to actually sit with those sensations?

Therapist: Notice that what feels uncomfortable is the idea of not handling it perfectly — not the relief and awkwardness themselves. What if, instead of trying to change those feelings, you just noticed them as they are, right now, while we're talking?

Patient: I don't know — I guess if I try to notice them now my chest gets tight, my breath gets shallow, and my mind starts grabbing for anything else to talk about. I can put my feet flat and take a slow breath and it eases a bit, but I'm getting kind of overwhelmed — can we slow down and maybe do a short breathing thing together?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck. Let's take a deep breath together, just for 4 counts: 

1... 
2... 
3... 
4... 

Now, notice what happens when you breathe out after that.

Patient: When I breathe out it actually loosens the knot a little — my shoulders drop and my chest feels a bit less tight. But I don't know, my mind still scrambles and wants to go somewhere else, like it's waiting to bail. Can we do that again a couple more times? I'm kind of nervous but willing to try.

Therapist: Let's try it again, just for a few more breaths. When you breathe in this time, notice what you notice about the knot in your chest. What happens when you hold that breath...

Patient: I don't know — when I hold it the knot tightens and my chest feels sort of clogged, and my head gets a bit fuzzy. I guess I start to feel panicky and want to exhale fast, which makes me want to bail. Can we do three slow breaths together? I'm nervous but I'll try.

Therapist: Let's do it together, one slow breath at a time. Here we go:

1... (hold the breath) 
2... (slowly exhale) 
3... (pause, then hold the breath again)

Notice what happens when you breathe out this time.

Patient: I don't know — when I breathe out the knot loosens a bit, my shoulders drop and my chest feels a little less heavy, but my head's still fuzzy and part of me wants to get up and leave. I guess it does calm me a tiny bit, though. Can we keep doing this a couple more times? I'm nervous but willing.

Therapist: That's a tiny step forward. Let's keep going. When you breathe in this time, notice what's different about the knot in your chest. What happens when you hold that breath...

Patient: I don't know — when I breathe in now the knot feels a little softer, like there's a tiny bit of space around it. When I hold it it still tightens, but not as severely and my head feels a touch clearer instead of totally fuzzy. Can we do a few more like that? I'm nervous but willing to keep going.

Therapist: Notice that even when the knot tightens, there's still that tiny space. Let's keep doing this. Here we go:

1... (hold the breath) 
2... (slowly exhale) 
3... (pause, then hold the breath again)

What happens when you breathe out this time.

Patient: I don't know — when I breathe out this time the knot loosens more, my shoulders drop and my chest feels a bit lighter, and my head gets a little clearer. I still have this nagging urge to get up and leave, though. I guess it helps enough that I can try a few more like that if we keep going.

Therapist: The urge to leave is still there, but it's not overwhelming you. You're noticing it, but you're also noticing that you can try to stay with it even if it shows up. That's a big step. Let's keep going, just for a few more breaths. When you breathe in this time, notice what's different about the knot in your chest. What happens when you hold that breath...

Patient: I don't know — when I breathe in the knot gets tighter and holding it brings this sudden rush of shame and frustration that makes my chest feel hot and my thoughts go weird. I guess it makes me want to bail and tell myself I'm pathetic for getting stuck on it, which just makes the panic worse. Can we keep doing the breaths a few more times? I'm nervous but I'll try.

Therapist: It sounds like that knot is really connected to some hard emotions. When you feel the rush of shame and frustration, notice what happens in your body when you try to push those thoughts away. What happens to your chest when you try to bail and tell yourself you're pathetic?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest just clamps down tighter, like it gets hot and my breath goes shallow and fast. Then I tense up, jaw and shoulders, and my mind scrambles with that "you're pathetic" loop, which makes me want to fidget or look for something to do so I don't have to feel it. Can we... slow down a bit? I feel kind of scattered right now.

Therapist: Let's take one deep breath together, just for a moment. Here we go:

1... (hold the breath) 
2... (slowly exhale) 
3... (pause, then hold the breath again)

Notice what happens to your body when you breathe that one deep breath.

Patient: I don't know — when I take that deep breath my chest loosens a bit and my shoulders drop, and for a moment things feel calmer. But then the shame rushes back and my thoughts start racing, and I feel jittery and distracted like I need to fidget or leave. Can we do a couple more slow breaths together? I'm nervous but I'll try.

Therapist: It sounds like that deep breath is giving you a tiny window of calm, but then the shame rushes back in. Let's try to notice what's happening in that moment when the shame shows up, without trying to push it away. What happens to your body when you feel that shame, and what's one small thing you could do with that feeling, just for a moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess my chest clamps down, my face gets hot, my jaw tightens and my hands start fidgeting, and then my head just races with that "you're pathetic" loop. Maybe I could, for one breath, press my feet flat, put my hand on my chest and quietly say to myself "this is shame" while I exhale slowly — it feels awkward but might keep me from bolting.

Therapist: That's a brave idea. When you say "this is shame" to yourself, notice what happens to your chest and the fidgeting in your hands. What if, for just one more breath, you let that feeling be there, even though it feels awkward, while you quietly breathe out the word "shame"?

Patient: I don't know — okay, I’ll try. I put my feet down and my hand on my chest and quietly breathe out "shame" — when I do it loosens a bit, like a small space opens, but then my face gets hot, my hands start fidgeting, and my head fills with that "you're pathetic" loop so I want to run. Can we slow down? I'm feeling scattered and shaky but I can try one more slow breath if that's okay.

Therapist: It sounds like that small space opened, but then the shame came back. Let's take another deep breath together, and this time, notice what happens when you try to push the shame away. What if, instead of pushing it, you just let the "you're pathetic" thought be there, while you breathe out the word "shame" again?

Patient: I don't know — okay, I'll try. When I breathe out "shame" it loosens a bit, but the "you're pathetic" thought still sits there and my hands start fidgeting and my face gets hot. I'm feeling really scattered and jumpy like my mind wants to run, but I guess I can do another slow breath if we do it together.

Therapist: It sounds like the "you're pathetic" thought is still there, but the looseness in your chest is still there too. When you breathe out "shame" again, notice what happens to your hands and face. What if, for just a moment, you let the fidgeting happen, but you also breathe out "shame" again?

Patient: I don't know — when I breathe out "shame" my chest eases a bit but my hands keep fidgeting and my face gets hot, and that "you're pathetic" loop is still there. I'm feeling jumpy and scattered, like I want to move or change the subject. Can we slow down — maybe one more slow breath — or, I don't know, maybe practice a tiny thing like what I'd text my sister instead? I'm nervous but I can try.

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto the looseness in your chest, even if your hands are still fidgeting. When you think about texting your sister, what's one small thing you could say to her that feels connected to what matters to you? Not about the shame or the loop, but about what's important to you right now.

Patient: I don't know — I guess I could keep it really simple, like: "Hey, I'm having a rough day and could really use someone to talk to. Are you free later?" It feels awkward and my hands are fidgeting just thinking about it, but it says what matters to me right now — I need someone to be there, not for them to fix anything.

Therapist: That's a small but important step. When you think about reaching out to your sister, notice what happens in your chest and hands. What if, for just a moment, you could let the fidgeting happen, and the "I need someone to talk to" feeling stay there, while you said those words to her?

Patient: I don't know — my chest tightens, my hands won't stop fidgeting, and this hot wave of shame and panic hits so my head starts racing. I guess I could let the fidgeting happen and send something simple like, "Hey, I'm having a rough day — can we talk later?" But I'm really nervous about actually hitting send; can we draft it together first or take one more slow breath?

Therapist: It sounds like the shame and panic are really strong right now. Let's take one more slow breath together. When you breathe out, notice what happens to your chest and hands. What if, instead of trying to push the shame away, you just let it be there, while you draft that message?

Patient: I don't know — okay, I breathe out and my chest loosens a little but my hands are still fidgeting and my face feels hot; the shame is sitting there and my head's all jumpy. I guess a simple draft could be: "Hey, I'm having a rough day — could we talk later?" but I'm really nervous to hit send because I keep imagining them not answering and me feeling pathetic again. Can we draft it together or do one more slow breath before I try?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really vulnerable about hitting send. Let's take that last slow breath together. When you breathe out, notice what happens to your hands and face. What if, instead of worrying about what they might say, you just focus on sending that message because it feels connected to what matters to you?

Patient: I don't know — I guess I can try to focus on that, but my hands are shaking and my chest is tight and I keep picturing them not replying and feeling pathetic all over again. Can we do one more slow breath together, and then actually draft the exact text line-by-line? I'm really nervous about hitting send and I'd feel safer if you stayed with me while I do it.
