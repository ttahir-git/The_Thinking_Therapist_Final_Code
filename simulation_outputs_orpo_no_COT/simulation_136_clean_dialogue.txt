Patient: Lately I've felt stuck and directionless, like since the move the only thing I even know about myself is that I'm a manager. The moment I try to plan anything my brain goes straight to the worst—there's a reorg, I get canned, can't find another job, burn through savings, end up back with my parents, relationships fall apart—and it all feels inevitable. I know it sounds drastic, but I can't stop picturing that whole chain like it's already written.

Therapist: That chain of thoughts feels really powerful right now, doesn't it? It's like your mind is creating a script that's hard to escape. Can you notice what happens when you try to imagine that worst-case scenario – what does your body feel like when you're picturing it?

Patient: My chest tightens and my breathing gets shallow, like I'm bracing for impact, and my stomach drops so I feel queasy. My hands go clammy and my jaw clenches, and then my head goes foggy — I can't think past the next awful image, it just loops on autopilot. It makes it impossible to plan or do anything because I keep replaying the next catastrophe like it's already happening.

Therapist: It sounds like that worst-case scenario is triggering a really strong physical response in your body – like your whole system is preparing for it to happen. And then when you try to think about it, that image just keeps looping back in. What would it be like to notice that tightening chest and that foggy head right now – without trying to push those thoughts away or change them?

Patient: I try to do that, but the moment I focus on the tight chest and fogginess it feels like I'm watching the first frame of a train wreck and the rest just snaps into place—reorg, fired, no job, savings gone—so the tightness actually gets worse. Noticing it doesn't calm me, it makes the story feel more real, like the sensations are proof the catastrophe is already starting. I can feel the shallow breath and jaw clench, and then my head fills with the next awful scene and I can't stay with the body-sensations without the predictions taking over.

Therapist: It feels like the more you try to notice the sensations, the more they get caught up in the story. It's like the train wreck image is pulling everything together, and you're stuck in the middle of it. Would it be possible to experiment with something different – like what if you didn't have to notice the sensations to stay safe, and what if they were just present while the story was playing out?

Patient: I don't see how I can "not notice" them — the tight chest and queasy stomach feel like proof the disaster's already starting, so pretending they're just background noise sounds unrealistic. If I tried to ignore them I'd probably just numb out and miss real warning signs, then when the reorg hits I'm blindsided, fired, can't find anything, burn through savings, and everything collapses. I'm willing to try whatever you suggest, but honestly I doubt it'll work — what would that even look like in practice?

Therapist: The feeling of needing to notice those sensations to stay safe is really strong. It's like you're saying, "If I don't notice this tight chest, I'll miss the warning signs." And that makes sense.

One way to approach this might be to try something that's not about noticing the sensations at all – but about taking care of your body while you're still caught up in the story. What if, instead of trying to stay present with the tightness, you just noticed your breath right now – even just for a second? Not to calm the tightness, but just to see that your breath is still moving in and out, even when the rest of your body is racing.

Patient: Okay, I tried for a second and yeah, I can feel the breath—shallow, a little fast—but it just feels like proof I'm bracing for impact. The moment I notice it my mind snaps into the whole script again—reorg, fired, can't find a job, burn through savings, end up back with my parents—and the breath starts feeling even more ragged. I get why you're suggesting it, but I don't see how just watching my breath would stop the loop—what would I actually do when the story starts replaying?

Therapist: It sounds like just noticing your breath isn't enough to break the loop – it's like the story is too powerful. That makes sense.

What if, instead of trying to stop the story, what if you could make room for it while you're still doing what matters to you? Like, what would it be like to plan something, even just for a minute, while the story is still playing out in your head?

Patient: Honestly, the moment I try to plan for even a minute the story just takes over — I'll start drafting a to-do and then my head snaps to "reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone" and the plan evaporates. I could force myself to do a tiny task while it's playing out, but it feels pointless if the future's already decided. I'm willing to try, but I'm skeptical—what would a one-minute plan actually look like that you think I could do while that loop's running?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of the story being true is so strong that even planning feels like it's not worth it. 

What if, instead of trying to plan something that might not work, what if you could just make room for one tiny step that feels connected to what matters to you? Like, what would it be like to write down one thing that matters to you right now, even if the story is playing out in your head?

Patient: I guess if I have to pick one thing, it's stability — having enough financial and emotional steadiness to feel like I'm not constantly on the edge. But the second I put that word down my brain snaps to the whole chain—reorg, fired, can't find work, savings drained, back with my parents—so writing it feels almost like tempting fate. I'll write "stability," but honestly I doubt that will make the loop any quieter.

Therapist: It sounds like writing down "stability" feels like a trigger for the whole story to come up. 

What if, instead of trying to tame the story with words, what if you could just notice what it's like to be with that word – "stability" – for a moment? Not to change it, but just to see what happens when you're with it, even if the story is still playing out?

Patient: I tried to sit with "stability" for a moment — I can hold a picture of a steady paycheck or a calm evening, but the second I do my brain slams into the collapse scenario: reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents. My chest tightens and my breath gets shallow and the word gets hijacked, so staying with it just feels like baiting the disaster. I don't see how to be with a word when my mind insists the catastrophe is already happening — what would "staying with it" actually look like for you?

Therapist: It sounds like your mind is really good at hijacking the word "stability" to fit the story. 

When I say "staying with it," I don't mean trying to control what happens or change the story. I mean noticing what's happening in your body and mind when you try to hold the word – not to stop the story, but to see what's there when you try to stay with it. 

For example, what would happen to your chest and breath if you just looked at it right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: When I look, my chest just tightens more and my breathing gets shallow and quick, like I'm bracing for the reorg call. That tightening feels like proof the disaster's already started, and my head instantly floods with the whole chain—fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents—so I can't hold the body-sensations without the story hijacking them. I want to try staying with it, but honestly the more I look the louder the prediction gets—how am I supposed to not spiral when the sensations seem to confirm it?

Therapist: It sounds like your body is already responding to the prediction – the tightening and shallow breath – and that makes it feel like you're losing control. 

Here's a tiny question: What would happen to the story – the reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone – if your body wasn't trying to prepare for it?

Patient: If my body stopped bracing, I don't think the story would suddenly disappear — it'd just mean I didn't notice until the reorg call drops and everything unravels faster: fired, can't find work, burn through savings, back with my parents. The only difference would be me being shocked instead of braced, and that feels worse, not better. Honestly, picturing myself chill about it just seems unrealistic — what would I even do instead if the call comes?

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried that if you don't prepare for the story, you won't be able to handle it when it happens. 

Here's a small experiment: What would it be like to hold the story while you're already doing something that matters to you – like checking your email, taking a shower, or making a cup of coffee? Not to stop the story, but to notice what happens when you're already engaged in something else.

Patient: I actually tried this—made a cup of coffee while the loop was running. For a few seconds my hands moved and the tightness eased a little, but then my mind filled the cup with the next disaster—reorg call mid-break, fired before I even sip, can't find work, savings gone—so it just felt like busywork while the inevitable unfolded. I can do the small task, but it still feels pointless if the story is deciding everything; what would you have me do in the moment when the predictions take over?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to do what matters to you, but the story is still showing up. 

When the predictions take over, what would it be like to say to yourself, "I'm already noticing the story, and my hands are moving anyway"? Not to change the story, but to notice the gap between what you're doing and what's happening in your mind.

Patient: I tried saying that to myself while making coffee — for a beat my shoulders loosened and the tightness eased, but then my brain screamed "reorg call, fired, can't find another job, savings gone" and my hands froze. It feels like a temporary Band‑Aid: the phrase helps for two seconds and the story just rewrites itself to include me pretending to be calm before everything collapses. I'm willing to keep trying, but how do I actually stop the loop from immediately turning those tiny wins into more proof of the disaster?

Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to hold onto that tiny moment of ease, but the story is still spinning a new narrative. 

Here's a question: What would it be like to not try to stop the story from showing up – not to try to calm it down, but to just notice it right there, while you're still making coffee? Not to change it, but to see what happens when you don't try to push it away.

Patient: I tried that while making coffee—if I don't fight it I can get the kettle on and my hands move, and for a second the tightness eases. But then my head just fills in the rest—reorg call, fired, can't find another job, savings gone—and the story gets more detailed, like it's proving itself. I don't see how noticing it helps long-term; it just feels like gathering evidence for the disaster instead of stopping it.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing the story is still contributing to the sense of inevitability. 

What if, instead of trying to stop the story, you were to ask yourself what matters most about not letting the disaster unfold – not because it will stop the story, but because it's what matters to you about your life right now?

Patient: What matters most is keeping my independence — being able to pay rent, not moving back in with my parents, and holding on to some sense of self-respect. But the moment I name that my brain stitches the rest of the script together: reorg call, fired, can't find another job, savings drained, back with my parents, relationships falling apart — so caring about it feels like bait for the disaster. I don't know how that helps; thinking about what matters just amplifies the loop, and honestly it's getting kind of overwhelming to keep circling this.

Therapist: It sounds like naming what matters to you is actually making the story more vivid, rather than helping you stay connected to what's important. 

Let's try something else. What if, right now, you could just be with the thought "I care about keeping my independence" – not as a way to stop the story, but just as a small, quiet thing in your body? Not to change it, but to notice what happens when you're with that thought, even if the story is still playing out.

Patient: When I try to hold "I care about keeping my independence" my chest tightens and the whole disaster script starts—reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents—so the thought feels like bait. Every once in a while there's a tiny, dull warmth imagining a steady paycheck, but it gets swallowed up fast by the loop. I don't really know how to stay with it without the story ramping up.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is really strong right now. 

Can you try noticing what happens to the warmth when it shows up – not as a way to stop the story, but just to see what's there when it's present?

Patient: It's a tiny, dull warmth for a second — like imagining a steady paycheck — but the moment I try to notice it my brain drags it into the whole script: reorg call, fired, can't find work. The warmth disappears and I'm left with that heavy, draining loop again, and honestly it's wearing me out to keep poking at it.

Therapist: It sounds like trying to notice the warmth is actually making it harder for you to stay with it. 

What if, instead of trying to notice the warmth, you could just let it be there – not to change it, but just to be present with it – while the story is still playing out?

Patient: I tried that—kept the little warmth there while the story ran in the background—but it just flickered and the loop swelled: reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents. It's wearing me down—I can't hold the tiny warmth and that avalanche at the same time; it feels like I'm just prolonging the inevitable and I don't know how to keep doing this without it tearing me apart.

Therapist: It sounds like the weight of the story is feeling overwhelming. 

Can you take one tiny step back from trying to hold onto the warmth or stop the story? What would it be like to simply notice that you're tired, and that the weight of the story is hard to bear, right now – without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay. I can notice I'm worn out and that the story feels unbearably heavy — chest tight, breath shallow — and the second I name it my mind spits the whole chain: reorg, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents, everything falling apart. It feels like too much to carry and I don't know how to keep doing this without it eating me alive; can we slow down or try something even smaller right now?

Therapist: It sounds like the story is still very present for you. 

What if we tried to notice the sensation of your breath moving in and out, right now – not to change it, but just to see what happens when you're with it, even if the story is still playing out?

Patient: Okay... when I tune to the breath it's shallow and tight, like I'm already bracing for bad news. For a second the loop quiets, but then it snaps back—reorg call, fired, can't find work—and my chest and hands go numb. I can try staying with the breath a bit longer if you want, but I really doubt it'll change anything.

Therapist: It sounds like the story is still very close to the surface. 

What if, instead of trying to change the story or stop the loop, you could just notice what happens when you're with the feeling of your breath moving in and out – without trying to push it away or change it?

Patient: I can feel the breath—tiny, shallow inhales and quick outs—and for a second the loop loosens. Then it snaps right back: reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents, and my hands go numb. This is starting to feel like too much—can we try something even smaller, like one one‑minute thing I could do right now that doesn't assume the worst?

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. 

What if, for just one minute, you could do something that matters to you – not because it will stop the story, but because it feels good to do – and you could do it without making any promises to yourself about what might happen next?

Patient: Okay. I'll try one minute of standing at the window, just watching the street and noticing my breath. I don't expect more than a couple seconds of relief before the reorg/fired/savings story kicks back in, but I'm willing to try — do you want me to do it now?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to take that tiny step. 

Yes, I'd like you to stand at the window and notice your breath while watching the street – not to change anything, but just to be with it for one minute. When you're ready, we can check in and see how it goes.

Patient: Okay... I did it — stood at the window for a minute and tried to follow my breath. For a couple of breaths the street felt ordinary and my chest loosened, then the loop slammed back in—reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone—and my hands went numb. My energy's pretty flat now and I'm not convinced that helped much; can we try something even smaller, like a 30‑second thing I can do sitting down?

Therapist: It sounds like you're still feeling the weight of the story. 

What if, for just 30 seconds, you could do something that feels slightly comforting to you – not because it will change what's happening, but because it feels good to do – like rubbing your hands together, or sipping a cup of tea, or noticing the sound of your breath?

Patient: I rubbed my hands together for thirty seconds and felt a tiny bit of warmth, like I almost breathed easier, then my brain crashed it back in—reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone—and the tightness and shallow breathing came roaring back and my hands went numb. It helped for maybe two breaths and now I'm flat and drained and doubting it did anything real. Can we try something even smaller—like one slow, deliberate exhale together? I don't know if that'll change the loop but I can't keep pushing hard right now.

Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really exhausted. 

Let's try just one slow, deliberate exhale together. I'll count it out with you: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... 13... 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... 21... 22... 23... 24... 25... 26... 27... 28... 29... 30... 31... 32... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39... 40... 41... 42... 43... 44... 45... 46... 47... 48... 49... 50... 51... 52... 53... 54... 55... 56... 57... 58... 59... 60... 61... 62... 63... 64... 65... 66... 67... 68... 69... 70... 71... 72... 73... 74... 75... 76... 77... 78... 79... 80... 81... 82... 83... 84... 85... 86... 87... 88... 89... 90... 91... 92... 93... 94... 95... 96... 97... 98... 99... 100... 101... 102... 103... 104... 105... 106... 107... 108... 109... 110... 111... 112... 113... 114... 115... 116... 117... 118... 119... 120... 121... 122... 123... 124... 125... 126... 127... 128... 129... 130... 131... 132... 133... 134... 135... 136... 137... 138... 139... 140... 141... 142... 143... 144... 145... 146... 147... 148... 149... 150... 151... 152... 153... 154... 155... 156... 157... 158... 159... 160... 161

Patient: Okay... I did the exhale. For a few seconds my shoulders loosened, but then the script slammed back in—reorg, fired, can't find work, savings gone, back with my parents—and now I just feel flat and kind of empty. I don't have much energy left; can we try something even smaller, like a ten‑second grounding or just one quiet question you ask me? I doubt it'll change the outcome, but I can't keep pushing harder right now.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really tired and just wanting to rest. 

What's one small thing you can notice right now that's already happening, without trying to change it – like the sensation of your feet touching the ground, or the sound of your breath?

Patient: My feet on the floor — I can feel the flat press of them, kind of steady but muted. Even noticing it just opens the script again — reorg call, fired, can't find work — and I go flat and drained like it's already happening.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet is still triggering the story. 

What if, instead of trying to change what's happening, you just asked yourself: "What matters to me about not letting the reorg call happen?"

Patient: What matters is keeping my independence—being able to pay rent, not moving back in with my parents, and not losing whatever self‑respect I have left. But the second I say that my brain strings the whole collapse together—reorg call, fired, can't find work, savings gone, relationships fall apart—so asking it just amplifies the dread and leaves me worn out. I don't know if reflecting on "what matters" helps; can we instead pick one tiny, practical thing I could do that feels like at least a little protection?
