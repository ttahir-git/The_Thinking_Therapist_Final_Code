Patient: Lately I've been feeling really stuck — my whole identity's wrapped up in being a nurse and I can't tell what matters beyond that. After the health scare and my OCD flaring, I just throw myself into work because it's something I can do, but outside of it I feel directionless. I've tried thinking about other things and making lists, but it doesn't work — how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: Feeling stuck when your whole identity is tied to something that's not working for you can be really tough. When you say "thinking about other things" and making lists doesn't help, what might be happening in that moment when you're trying those things?

Patient: When I try to think about other things or make lists, my head just gets hijacked by the 'what-ifs' from the health scare and the OCD — I start replaying scenarios and counting steps in my head. It makes me anxious and distracted so the lists feel pointless; sometimes I can't finish them or I keep revising like if I change it enough maybe I'll calm down. How is that supposed to help? It just leaves me feeling more stuck.

Therapist: Those "what-ifs" can be really overwhelming. When you notice your head getting hijacked by them, what happens if you just made space for them to be there, without trying to chase them away or "fix" them? Would that tiny bit of space be enough to let the lists be just a thought, rather than trying to make them perfect?

Patient: I've tried sitting with those thoughts before — I tell myself to make space, but it just feels like I'm letting the worry take over instead of doing something useful. How is that supposed to help? I'm a doer, a nurse — letting things sit makes me more frantic and I end up obsessing and rewriting the lists until I can't think straight.

Therapist: It sounds like when you try to sit with those thoughts, the feeling of being a "doer" gets in the way. What would happen if, for just one moment, you could let that need to be in control be noticed – without needing to push it away or "fix" it?

Patient: How is that supposed to help? If I just notice the need to control it feels like I'm feeding it — it gets louder and I start spiraling about mistakes or missing something. I don't know, maybe if there was a way to notice without it turning into a checklist, but I can't picture how that would work.

Therapist: Feeding it does seem to make it louder. When you say "noticing without it turning into a checklist," what if that noticing could be about something else – like the feeling of needing to control it, or the breath moving in your body when you think about it?

Patient: I've tried the breath thing before — my chest tightens, my stomach knots up, my hands start fidgeting, and then I end up counting breaths or worrying I'm doing it "wrong." How is that supposed to help? I'm not into vague prompts; give me one concrete thing I can try right now, or I'm just going to spiral.

Therapist: When you notice your hands start fidgeting, what would happen if, for just one second, you let the fidgeting be – without trying to stop it?

Patient: I don't know — if I "let it be" for a second it just snowballs until I'm rewinding every step. I've tried that; a second becomes a minute and then I'm counting and checking. How is that supposed to help? If you're going to ask me to try it now, give me one exact thing to do in that second besides "notice."

Therapist: What if, in that exact second when your hands start fidgeting, you simply opened your hand – without thinking about what to do with it, or what might happen next?

Patient: Okay — fine, I’ll try opening my hand. The minute I do, my brain starts firing off a checklist and I’m already rewinding steps like it triggered something; it doesn’t calm down, it kicks off the spiral. How is that supposed to help? If you want me to do it, give me one exact next thing to do so it doesn’t turn into checking.

Therapist: Noticing the spiral shows you're not avoiding it. What if, right after you opened your hand – *without trying to stop the spiral* – you looked around you, and noticed one single thing you could see?

Patient: Okay — I looked, and the first thing I saw was the faded blue mug on the bedside table. It took my head off the checklist for a second, but then my brain kicked right back into rewinding and counting. How is that supposed to help? If that’s the move, tell me the one exact next thing to do so it doesn’t turn into checking.

Therapist: The blue mug noticing didn't help stop the checking. What if, right after noticing the blue mug – without changing what's happening – you made a tiny movement with your finger?

Patient: Fine — I made the tiny movement with my finger, and of course my brain flipped straight into rewinding and checking like a switch. How is that supposed to help? If you're going to have me do this, tell me one exact, concrete next thing to do right now so it doesn't just turn into more checking, because I'm getting really frustrated and skeptical this is actually useful.

Therapist: Noticing the rewinding and checking doesn't change it. What if, right now, while you're still looking at the blue mug, you took a tiny breath in – not to stop the checking, but just to be present with it – and said to yourself, "I see this."

Patient: Alright — I did it. I took a tiny breath and said "I see this," and for a beat the checklist quieted, then my head snapped back to rewinding and counting like it always does. How is that supposed to help? If you want me doing this, give me one exact next action that actually breaks the checking instead of just pausing it, because I'm getting really frustrated and skeptical this is useful.

Therapist: The pause didn't break the checking. What if, right after saying "I see this" – not to stop it, but to make room for it – you wrote down exactly one thing that you needed to do to make space for the checking – like "Make room for it" or "Notice it when it comes up"?

Patient: Okay — I wrote "Notice it when it comes up" on a sticky and stuck it by the mug. As soon as I did, my brain started nitpicking the wording and checking if that was "right," so it didn't stop the spiral. How is that supposed to help? If you're going to have me do this, tell me one exact next action I can do right now so it doesn't just become more checking.

Therapist: Noticing the nitpicking didn't break the spiral. What if, right now, while you're looking at the sticky note with "Notice it when it comes up" – not to change it, but to make room for it – you looked at the mug again, and noticed the blue color of the mug, without trying to notice the checking?

Patient: I looked at the faded blue — for a second it distracted the checklist, but then my brain slammed back into counting and rewinding. How is that supposed to help? Be straight with me: give me one exact, concrete next thing to do right now so it doesn't just become more checking, because I'm getting really frustrated.

Therapist: Noticing the distraction didn't break the spiral. What if, right now, while you're looking at the mug again, you picked up your hand that you opened earlier – the one that wasn't doing anything – and gently placed it on your knee?

Patient: I put my hand on my knee like you said — it barely grounded me, then my chest tightened and my brain started the counting and rewinding again. How is that supposed to help? I'm getting really tired and skeptical this is doing anything—give me one exact, concrete next thing to do right now that will actually interrupt the checking, or can we slow down?

Therapist: Noticing the grounding didn't stop the tightening. I want to try something different. Instead of doing something with your hand, I want you to notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – not your chest, not your hand, just the feeling of your feet connecting with the floor. Can you make space for that feeling for just one breath?

Patient: Okay — I did it. I felt my feet for one breath and it grounded me for a second, then the counting and chest tightness kicked back in. How is that supposed to help? If you're going to have me do this, give me one exact next thing to do right now so it doesn't just become more checking, and can we slow down a bit?

Therapist: Noticing your feet grounded you for a second. Instead of noticing the chest tightening, I want you to notice the sensation of that tightness – not to change it, but to make room for it – while you're still feeling your feet connected to the ground. Can you say to yourself, "This tightness is here, and my feet are here"?

Patient: I said it — "This tightness is here, and my feet are here" — and it calmed the checklist for a beat, then the counting slammed back in. How is that supposed to help? I'm getting really tired and frustrated; slow down and give me one exact thing to do next that actually interrupts the checking, not just pauses it.

Therapist: Noticing the tightness and feet calmed it for a beat. I want you to notice the sensation of that beat – not the counting, not the tightness – when it shows up again. Can you make space for that moment, just for one second, when the counting tries to come back in?

Patient: I tried to make space for that beat — I felt a tiny pause, then the counting slammed back in. How is that supposed to help? It just hands my brain a second to gear up and check harder. If you're going to have me do this, give me one exact, concrete action to do the instant the counting starts — snap your fingers once, say one word, something action‑oriented I can actually do — and please slow down, I'm getting really tired of this back-and-forth.

Therapist: Noticing the pause didn't stop the counting. When the counting starts, I want you to touch your nose.

Patient: Alright — I touched my nose when the counting started. It paused for a beat, then my brain just kicked harder like it was annoyed; it didn’t stop it. How is that supposed to help? I'm a doer — give me one exact next action to do in that beat so it doesn't just escalate (snap fingers, say one word, whatever), and please slow down — I'm getting really tired and frustrated with this back‑and‑forth.

Therapist: The pause didn't stop the counting. When you touch your nose next time, immediately after the counting starts, *push your chair away from the table* with your foot.

Patient: How is that supposed to help? I’m not about to fling a chair and risk falling — my balance and knees have been shaky since the health scare. If you want an exact, action‑oriented move I can actually do safely, tell me one: stamp my foot hard once, stand up and sit down once, or snap my fingers — which one and how exactly should I do it?

Therapist: I'm so sorry about your concerns. Let's focus on something small and safe. When the counting starts, I want you to *snap your fingers once* and look up at the ceiling.

Patient: I did it — snapped once and looked up. It shifted me for a split second, then the counting came back louder and faster. How is that supposed to help? I'm a doer and I'm getting really tired and skeptical — if you're going to keep giving micro-actions, give me one concrete sequence I can do that actually interrupts it (like snap, say "stop," and take three deliberate steps), and please slow down.

Therapist: I'm so sorry it didn't shift the counting for you. When you feel the counting coming back in, I want you to *snap your fingers once*, say "stop," and take three deliberate steps forward.

Patient: Okay — I tried it: snapped once, said "stop," and took three careful steps forward (slowly, my knees are shaky after the health scare). It gave me maybe half a beat of space, then the counting came back louder. How is that supposed to help? I'm getting really tired of these micro‑moves that only pause it — give me one exact, safe action I can do while sitting that will actually interrupt the spiral, and please slow down.

Therapist: I'm so sorry it didn't hold the space for you. When you feel the counting coming back in, I want you to *pull your sleeves down* with both hands, and notice what happens in your body while you do that small action.

Patient: I pulled my sleeves down like you said — felt the fabric and the movement gave me a tiny second of something to focus on, but then my brain immediately started critiquing how straight the cuffs were and the counting stormed back in. How is that supposed to help? If we're doing action stuff, give me one exact, safe sequence I can do right now that actually interrupts the spiral (I need something I can do while seated), and please slow down — I'm getting pretty tired and skeptical of these micro‑moves.

Therapist: Noticing the critiquing didn't stop it. When you feel the counting coming back in, I want you to *pull your sleeves down*, *make a small fist*, and say "let it be."

Patient: I tried it — pulled my sleeves down, made a small fist, said “let it be” — it quieted things for a split second and then the checking came back harder, critiquing even the way I made the fist. How is that supposed to help? I'm really tired of these tiny gestures that only pause the storm — if we're doing action stuff, give me one exact, safe, seated sequence I can do right now that actually interrupts the spiral, and please slow down.

Therapist: I'm so sorry it didn't hold the quiet for you. When you feel the counting coming back in, I want you to *pull your sleeves down*, *make a small fist*, *say "let it be,"* *and then lean forward slightly* into the chair.

Patient: I pulled my sleeves down, made a small fist, said "let it be," and leaned forward slightly (kept it gentle because my knees are shaky since the health scare). It bought me a tiny half‑beat of space, then my brain started critiquing how I leaned and how tight my fist was and the counting came crashing back. How is that supposed to help? I'm getting really tired of these micro‑moves that just pause things — give me one exact, safe, seated sequence that actually interrupts the spiral the moment it starts, and please slow down; I need something that actually feels like it will work.

Therapist: I'm so sorry it didn't hold the space for you. When you feel the counting coming back in, I want you to *pull your sleeves down*, *make a small fist*, *say "let it be,"* *and then make a tiny note to yourself that says "I'm here"* – just that simple sentence.

Patient: I did it — pulled my sleeves down, made the small fist, said “let it be,” and wrote “I’m here” on a little note by the mug. It bought me a hair of space and then my brain started critiquing the handwriting and how steady my fist was and the counting rolled back in. How is that supposed to help? Give me one exact, safe, seated sequence that actually interrupts the spiral the instant it starts, and please slow down — I'm getting really tired and skeptical of these micro‑moves.

Therapist: Noticing the critiquing didn't stop it. When the counting starts, I want you to *pull your sleeves down*, *make a small fist*, *say "let it be,"* *and then make a tiny note to yourself that says "I'm here"* – *but this time, before writing, look at the note and say "I'm here"* – just the words, without trying to make sense of them.

Patient: I did it — looked at the note and said "I'm here" before writing, and it gave me a tiny beat but then my brain immediately started nitpicking and the counting slammed back in. How is that supposed to help? I'm really tired of these little chains of steps that only pause things — give me one exact, safe, seated action (step-by-step: what to do, how long, and the exact words) that will actually interrupt the spiral the instant it starts, and please slow down.

Therapist: I'm so sorry it didn't hold the space for you. When the counting starts, I want you to *pull your sleeves down*, *make a small fist*, *say "let it be,"* *and then, without moving, say to yourself "I am present" – exactly that phrase, in that moment, without adding or changing anything.

Patient: I tried it — pulled my sleeves down, made the fist, said "let it be," and then, exactly, "I am present." It quieted things for a breath and then my brain immediately started nitpicking my tone and the counting came back louder. How is that supposed to help? I'm getting really tired of these micro‑rituals — if you're going to give me steps, give me one exact, safe, seated sequence (step‑by‑step: what to do, how long, and the exact words) that actually interrupts the spiral the instant it starts, and please slow down.
