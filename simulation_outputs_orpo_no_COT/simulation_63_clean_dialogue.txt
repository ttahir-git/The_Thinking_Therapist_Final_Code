Patient: Lately I've been avoiding get-togethers with friends — and even family, whether they're nearby or far — because my anxiety turns every social situation into a chain of disasters I just know will happen. If I go, I'll freeze up, say something humiliating, everyone will silently judge me, people will stop inviting me, and I'll end up isolated and worse off at work from the stress. I'm an accountant in my late twenties dealing with burnout and this empty-nest thing, and my brain just feels like a fortune-telling machine that only predicts the worst.

Therapist: That fortune-telling machine sounds really loud right now. When you say "I'll freeze up, say something humiliating," what would happen if you made room for just one tiny moment of being there with your friends, even if it felt like your brain was predicting disaster?

Patient: I wish I could try that, but if I even stay for a bit I'll probably freeze, blurt something stupid, everyone will look embarrassed and whisper, then they’ll stop inviting me and I’ll spiral — my work will suffer, I’ll mess up a big client report, and eventually I’ll lose my job. I know that sounds extreme, but my brain is already narrating that whole chain like it’s guaranteed, and considering anything else just feels fake. I'm totally hooked by that story and I don't see how staying a moment would stop it.

Therapist: It feels like that story is already playing out in your mind, and that's making it hard to imagine taking a different step. What would it be like for just *one* moment – just 30 seconds – to show up with your friends while your brain is still predicting disaster?

Patient: I don't think I could even manage 30 seconds — the second I'm there my head starts the whole movie: I freeze, blurt something awkward, people stare and whisper, they quietly stop inviting me, I panic, botch a report at work from the stress, and before I know it I'm fired and alone. Trying to picture just being there feels fake, like I'm ignoring the inevitability of that chain.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of being there while your brain predicts disaster feels like a betrayal – like you'd be ignoring the very real threat that's driving your anxiety.

Patient: Yeah — exactly. It feels like pretending to stay would be lying to myself, because if I show up even briefly I can already see the whole collapse: I freeze, say something mortifying, people whisper and stop inviting me, I spiral, my work tanks, and I lose my job. It makes me angry and exhausted to hear "just try" because that feels like denying the obvious disaster my brain is already watching happen.

Therapist: It feels like the idea of "just trying" is actually what's making it feel like you'd be lying to yourself – like you're being asked to choose between staying true to what your brain is already predicting, and being honest about how that feels.

Patient: Yeah — exactly. "Just try" feels like lying to the only thing that feels real right now. Part of me wants to see if it's wrong, but that fortune-telling voice is so loud I already watch the whole collapse — freeze, say something dumb, everyone whispers, they stop inviting me, I spiral at work and get fired — so trying feels pointless and I'm honestly angry and exhausted; can we slow down?

Therapist: The feeling of being angry and exhausted while that fortune-telling voice is so loud – it sounds like you're already feeling the weight of that "wrong" prediction.

Patient: Yeah — it's suffocating and exhausting; my chest tightens and my mind immediately reruns the scene where I freeze, blurt something humiliating, people whisper, stop inviting me, I spiral at work and mess everything up. It makes me angry because it feels like you're asking me to pretend that chain isn't real or like I'm overreacting. Can we slow down? I'm not ready to be pushed into "try" mode yet.

Therapist: The tightness in your chest and the anger – it sounds like that's what's keeping you from being able to consider something else.

Patient: Yeah — exactly. My chest clamps up, my hands go numb, and that makes the catastrophe feel inevitable, like I'm watching the final scene on repeat. Trying to imagine another outcome feels like lying to myself, and I'm so tired of being told to "just try." Can we actually slow down and sit with the panic for a bit instead of pushing me to do something right now?

Therapist: It sounds like the panic is already happening, even when you're trying to slow down.

Patient: Yeah — even trying to slow down, my chest tightens and my head starts the whole movie: I freeze, blurt something humiliating, people whisper and stop inviting me, I spiral, screw up a big client report from the stress, and then I lose my job. It feels absurd when others say it might not happen, because the panic is so vivid I can't see past the collapse. Can we actually slow down? I'm not ready to be pushed into trying anything yet.

Therapist: It feels like the panic is so vivid that you can't imagine anything else.

Patient: Yes — exactly. It's like my brain's already watching the final act on repeat: I freeze, say something humiliating, everyone whispers, they stop inviting me, I spiral at work and eventually get fired — and I can't force myself to see anything else without feeling like a liar. I'm exhausted and angry that people keep telling me to "try," so can we actually slow down and sit with this instead of jumping to solutions?

Therapist: The exhaustion and anger – it sounds like that's what's making it hard for you to imagine sitting with the panic.

Patient: Yeah, exactly — the exhaustion and anger make the panic louder, my chest tightens and my hands go numb, and then the movie starts: I freeze, blurt something humiliating, everyone whispers, they stop inviting me, I spiral and mess up a big client report and get fired. Sitting with that feels impossible and like I'm being asked to lie to myself, so can we actually slow down? I'm not ready to be pushed into trying anything yet.

Therapist: It sounds like you're really stuck in that cycle of exhaustion, anger, and panic.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. I feel stuck and boxed in: the more I TRY to stop it, the louder the movie gets — I can almost hear the whispering and see the looks, and then the whole collapse follows — freeze, say something stupid, nobody invites me, I spiral at work and get fired — it's like a script I can't turn off. I'm really tired and angry hearing "try" again; can we actually slow down and just sit with how awful that feels instead of jumping to solutions?

Therapist: The feeling of being stuck and boxed in – it sounds like that's what's making it so hard for you to imagine doing anything else.

Patient: Yeah — exactly. It feels like being boxed in, like there's no pause button; my chest tightens and I can already see the whole sequence — I freeze, blurt something humiliating, people whisper, they stop inviting me, I spiral, mess up a client report, and get fired — imagining anything else feels like lying to myself. I'm so tired of being told to "try" — can we actually just sit with how awful that certainty feels for a while? I don't want solutions yet, I just need it acknowledged.

Therapist: It sounds like you're just wanting to be seen where you are, in that certainty, without trying to change it.

Patient: Yeah — that's exactly it. I just want you to see me stuck in that certainty, not be told to "just try" or that I'm overreacting. If I admit it I feel like you'll minimize it and then I'm back watching the whole collapse — I freeze, blurt something humiliating, people whisper and stop inviting me, I spiral at work and get fired. Can we really just sit with that for a while?

Therapist: It sounds like the fear of being minimized is what's keeping you from sitting with it.

Patient: Yeah — exactly. I'm terrified you'll downplay it, and then the movie fast-forwards: I freeze, blurt something humiliating, people whisper and stop inviting me, I spiral at work and get fired. I just need you to stay with how certain and awful that feels — can we stay here a bit longer?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the certainty and the fear of it being downplayed*

Patient: Okay... I do feel a tiny bit calmer that you're not minimizing it, but my brain's still playing the final act on loop — my chest tightens, my hands go numb, and I can already see myself freezing, blurting something humiliating, everyone whispering, then no more invites, my work spiraling and me losing my job. I want to stay here in that awful certainty for a while longer; I can't handle being pushed to "try" yet.

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the loop of the final act and the tension in your body*

Patient: Okay... I do feel a little less frantic that you're not minimizing it, but the loop is still blasting — my chest's tight, my hands go numb, and I can already see the whole collapse: I freeze, say something humiliating, people whisper, stop inviting me, I spiral at work, and get fired. I don't want to be pushed to "try" yet; can we just stay with that awful certainty a bit longer and talk about what the very worst moment in that movie looks like right now?

Therapist: *I gently point to the worst moment in the loop*

Patient: The worst moment is the exact second my mouth opens and I say something mortifying — like a joke that lands horribly or a clumsy comment about someone's life — and the room goes dead quiet. I can already see everyone's faces shift from friendly to embarrassed, hear a stifled laugh, then those invites stop, I spiral into panic, botch a client report from not concentrating, lose the client, and get fired. I know it sounds extreme, but my brain plays that domino sequence on repeat and any other outcome feels fake and impossible. My chest's tight just saying it; can we stay with that for a while?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the tightness in your chest as you describe the worst moment*

Patient: When I picture that exact second my face flushes, my throat closes, and the words are already tumbling out like they have no brakes — and then the room dies and everything after that unfurls like clockwork: whispers, no more invites, spiraling at work, losing the client, getting fired. I get furious at myself for being so predictable, which makes me want to run and hide, which feels like the only honest response to that certainty. I need us to just stay here with how real that feels for now — no advice, no "try" — can we do that a bit longer?

Therapist: *I nod, staying with you, noticing the mix of emotions: fury, shame, and the urge to hide*

Patient: Okay… that actually helps a tiny bit that you're still here, but the replay is ruthless — my face heats, my throat tightens, and the words tumble out like they're already scripted: something clumsy like, "Wow, you've really changed, huh?" and everyone goes silent and uncomfortable. Then the whispers start — "What did she mean by that?" — and the rest unfolds: no more invites, I can't sleep, I botch the report from panic, lose the client, and get fired. I'm furious at myself for being so predictable and then I want to run; I don't want to entertain any other ending because they feel fake. Can we stay with that exact scene and those whispers a bit longer?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the scene unfolding in vivid detail: the words tumbling out, the silence, the whispers, and the rest of the story*

Patient: Okay... it actually helps that you're still here, but the scene is so loud: my mouth opens, I blurt the stupid line, the room goes dead, someone snorts a laugh, then the whispers start, invites stop, I can't sleep, I botch the report, lose the client, and I'm fired. I know it sounds extreme, but it feels inevitable and any "maybe" feels fake and dishonest — I'm angry and exhausted and I don't want to be pushed to "try" right now. Can we just stay in this exact loop a bit longer so I can get it all out?

Therapist: *I gently nod, staying with you in the loop, noticing the anger, exhaustion, and the need to get it all out*

Patient: Okay... it actually helps that you're still here. The scene just keeps extending — after the room goes quiet, invites stop, I can't sleep, I botch the report, lose the client, get fired, can't pay rent, have to move back in with my parents, everyone quietly judges me, and I'm completely alone. I know it sounds over the top but my brain plays it like a timetable and I can't make it stop; can we stay with that loop a bit longer? I'm exhausted and angry and not ready for solutions yet.

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the exhaustion, anger, and the weight of being alone, as the loop keeps unfolding*

Patient: Okay... it helps that you're still here, but my brain just keeps tacking on more catastrophes: I can't pay rent, I move back in with my parents and feel like a failure, friends stop answering, my partner gets fed up and leaves, and then everything spirals into loneliness and numbness. My chest's tight just saying it and I get furious at myself for being so hooked on the script, which makes me want to run and hide even more. I'm not ready for solutions — can we stay with this loop a bit longer?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the tightness in your chest, the fury at yourself, and the feeling of wanting to run and hide, as the loop keeps unfolding*

Patient: Yeah — it actually helps that you're still here. My brain just won't stop: after I move back home I can already see a neighbor avoiding eye contact, my old coworkers whispering when I walk past, and me shrinking into numbness until I barely leave the house. I don't want advice or optimism right now — can we stay with how helpless and humiliated that feels for a while longer?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the feeling of helplessness and humiliation, as the image of the neighbor avoiding eye contact and the whispering plays out*

Patient: Yeah — it helps that you're still here, but the loop just keeps tacking on more humiliation: a neighbor avoiding eye contact, old coworkers whispering as I walk by, my phone stops ringing, and I shrink into the house until I barely leave. I can feel my face burning just saying it and I get furious at myself for being so predictable, which makes me want to run and hide even more. Can we stay with that helpless, humiliated feeling a bit longer?

Therapist: *I stay with you, noticing the burning in your face, the fury at yourself, and the feeling of wanting to run and hide, as the loop keeps unfolding*

Patient: Okay—it's actually calmer that you're still here, but the loop won't quit: my mouth goes dry, I blurt the line, the room goes dead, invites stop, I spiral at work, lose the client, get fired, can't pay rent, move back with my parents, my partner leaves, neighbors and old coworkers whisper, my phone stops ringing and I just shrink into the house. Saying it makes me flush and furious at myself, and I don't want solutions right now—can we just sit with that exact helpless, humiliated feeling a bit longer? I'm not ready to try anything yet.

Therapist: *I gently nod, staying with you in that exact moment, noticing the flush, the fury, and the feeling of being stuck in that helpless, humiliated place*

Patient: Okay — it actually helps that you're still here. The loop's still blasting: my face heats, my throat clamps, the words tumble out, the room goes dead, invites stop, I spiral at work, lose the client, get fired, move back with my parents, my partner leaves, neighbors whisper, my phone stops ringing and I barely leave the house. I'm furious at myself for being so stuck in that script and I don't want to "try" anything yet — can you just keep naming the sensations with me for a bit longer?
