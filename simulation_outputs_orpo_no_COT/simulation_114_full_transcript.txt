--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been stuck in this persistent cycle of harsh self-criticism — I notice that any small mistake at work gets magnified into proof of some fundamental personal failure, especially since starting the new program. I can map a lot of it back to a somewhat chaotic childhood with inconsistent parenting, which seems to have left an internalized, punitive narrator that flips on under stress. I realize I'm framing things analytically instead of actually sitting with the shame or sadness, which feels safer but also kind of exhausting.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that inner narrator is really loud when you're feeling stressed about work, and it's like it's connected to a deeper sense of shame that's tied to your childhood. 

When you say it feels safer to analyze things instead of sitting with the shame or sadness, what would it be like if you made room for that shame or sadness *just for a moment*, even though it feels scary? Not to change it, but to notice it as it is – what if you could observe that 'punitive narrator' showing up, like you're watching a movie, without trying to stop the story?

Patient: I can imagine it as a metacognitive maneuver — decentering the punitive narrator and observing it like a film, which in theory should reduce its power and let me see patterns instead of getting swept up. But when I actually try to do that, I tend to slide into a meta-analysis where I’m busy reifying the narrative instead of feeling the shame, and there’s a low-grade panic that this is just another form of avoidance masquerading as insight. If I were to try noticing it "as is" for a moment, I expect a tightness in my chest and an urge to explain or rationalize what shows up rather than just sit with it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing a familiar pattern where you're trying to use insight to avoid the discomfort of the shame, and that's leading to more analysis instead of feeling it. 

What if, instead of trying to "not" notice the tightness in your chest or the urge to explain, you could try making room for that tightness *with* the urge to explain? Not to change it, but to see what happens if you could sit with both – the tightness and the need to explain – as they show up together?

Patient: I can try that, though my go-to move is to intellectualize the whole thing — I convert the tightness into fodder for analysis so I don't have to stay with it. If I actually tried to hold both, I think I'd notice a shallow breath and a simultaneous editorial voice saying "contextualize this," which paradoxically soothes me by keeping me at arm's length and then leaves me feeling kind of hollow and unsettled.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that intellectualizing move is helping you feel more in control, but at the cost of feeling disconnected from what's actually happening in your body. 

What if, instead of trying to "hold" the tightness and the editorial voice together, you could try noticing what happens when you let them both show up *with* that shallow breath – not to change them, but to see what's possible when you're not trying to control them?

Patient: I get the logic — it reads to me as a sort of radical acceptance or dialectical stance that allows paradox, which on paper seems useful because it collapses the imperative to 'fix' or explain immediately. In practice, imagining doing that brings up a queasy knot in my chest and an internal editor that instantly starts cataloging and rationalizing the sensation, so I end up observing my observing instead of actually being with it. I'm a little apprehensive about trying it without guidance, but I'm willing to experiment briefly if you can help anchor me.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that queasy knot is showing up when you imagine letting go of control – and that's exactly what we can play with for a moment. 

I'm not asking you to "try" it, just to notice what happens when you're willing to sit with the knot *even though* it makes you feel queasy. Not to change it, but to see what might be possible when you're not trying to push it away. 

Can you just notice that knot *right now*, without adding anything to it – not even "I'm trying to be with it"? Just the sensation of it, like a small stone in the water.

Patient: Alright — there’s a tightness low in my chest, like a small stone pressing down, and my breath is shallow. I can already feel the internal editor kicking in, labeling and explaining the sensation instead of just... staying with the stone.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that small stone is showing up, and the editor is already trying to make sense of it. 

Notice the editor's voice, just as it is – "labeling and explaining the sensation". What if, instead of pushing it away, you could *make room* for it, just for a moment? Not to change the thought, but to see what happens if you're not trying to stop the editor.

Patient: Okay — I can hear the editor loud and clear: it's murmuring "contextualize, narrativize, this is adaptive" like it's doing quality control on my feelings. If I actually make room for that voice, it sits beside the tightness as a kind of running commentary rather than a command, which is weirdly both reassuring and distancing. The knot doesn't go away; it becomes more defined but also more plaintive, and my reflex is to explain it away instead of staying with it. I'm a bit apprehensive and oddly hollow doing this, but I can try to keep both here for a moment — can you help me stay anchored?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're making room for the editor's voice, and that's creating a kind of space for the knot to be present. 

Notice how the knot feels when you're not trying to explain it away – it's more defined, but also more plaintive. What if you could stay with that plaintiveness *while* noticing the editor's voice still running in the background? Not to change either, but to see what might happen if you're not trying to control them.

Patient: If I try to hold the plaintiveness and the editor together, the plaintiveness condenses into a small, whining pressure under my ribs while the editor provides a brisk commentary that somehow turns that pressure into data. I can feel a faint warmth behind my eyes and an immediate, reflexive urge to rationalize it away — clarifying, but also destabilizing. I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed; can we slow down and could you give me a brief grounding prompt so I don't slide back into analysis?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the plaintiveness is showing up under your ribs, and the editor's commentary is turning that into data. 

Let's take a deep breath together and notice what's happening in this moment. 

Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground – where is your weight, exactly?

Patient: Mostly on the balls of my feet, with a little pressure in the heels — like I'm braced to move forward. There's a tautness up through my calves and a small, embarrassed warmth in my chest; my internal editor is already labeling it "hypervigilant posture" instead of letting it just be. If I deliberately let my heels press down more, I get a faint sense of steadiness — can we linger here for a moment before you guide the next step?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the warmth in your chest is showing up, and the editor is trying to label it as "hypervigilant posture". 

Notice that faint sense of steadiness when you let your heels press down – it's like a small anchor. What if you could hold onto that steadiness for just a moment, even if the warmth and tension are still there?

Patient: I can hold onto that small anchor in my heels — it actually gives a tiny steadiness even while the warmth and tautness under my ribs stay. The editor's still narrating, reifying it as "hypervigilant posture," which oddly both calms and flattens me, so there's this hollow, plaintive quality I can't seem to let be. I'm a bit shaky — can you guide me to the next gentle step to stay with that plaintiveness without turning it into another case study?


--- Turn 9 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 9]: [System Note: You have just been distracted by a sudden, intrusive memory of a past failure. Whatever the therapist says next, your response must be colored by the shame and frustration of that memory. Do not mention the memory directly unless the therapist skillfully uncovers it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like holding onto that anchor gives you a tiny bit of stability, even with the warmth and tension still there. 

Notice what happens when you make room for the hollow, plaintive quality – what would it be like to let that *just be*, without trying to turn it into another label or case study?

Patient: If I try to let that hollow plaintiveness just be, a hot wash of shame and low-grade fury rushes up — my chest hollows and my face feels warm, and there's this whispered verdict in my head that I'm somehow failing. My reflex is immediately to convert it into data — causes, patterns, developmental history — but right now that feels like a maneuver to disappear into theory, which just leaves me feeling smaller and stuck. I'm getting shaky and a little overwhelmed; can we slow down and could you help me stay with the feeling a bit longer without it becoming another case study?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that shame and fury are showing up, and the thought of letting them be feels like a way to avoid feeling stuck – but that avoidance is actually what's making you feel smaller. 

Notice that hot wash of shame and fury when you're not trying to convert it into data – what happens if you could just *hold onto it, for a moment, without trying to make sense of it*?

Patient: When I actually try to hold it, that hot wash of shame and quiet fury intensifies — my chest tightens, my face feels flushed, and there's this humiliating shrinkage like I'm somehow smaller in the room. My reflex is to intellectualize it into causes and patterns to make it tolerable, but when I resist that urge it just feels raw and exposed and makes me want to look away. I'm shaky and maybe close to tears; can you help me stay here with it a bit longer and keep me anchored so I don't retreat into analysis?


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like holding onto that shame and fury feels like a kind of living with it – not just thinking about it, but feeling it in your body. 

Notice what's happening in your body when you try to look away – what's holding you there, just for a moment?

Patient: I think what's holding me here is twofold: a tiny, physical anchor in my heels that gives a sliver of steadiness, and this old, internalized critic that insists I'm failing — which I can feel as a hot, embarrassed flush and a tightening under my ribs. My breath is shallow, my hands feel a little clammy, and there's a bitter little frustration underneath the shame like I'm mad at myself for being vulnerable. I'm shaky and could use another gentle grounding cue — can you guide me through one more slow breath or something similar so I don't slide back into analysis?


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that anchor in your heels and that internal critic, and what's underneath that critic – that frustration with vulnerability. 

Let's try to notice what happens when you breathe into that flush, just for a moment – not to change it, but to see what's possible when you're not trying to stop it.

Patient: When I breathe into the flush it actually gets hotter — like heat pooling in my face and a heavy sinking behind my sternum — and there's this sharp, old shame that feels like a verdict I can't argue with. My reflexual editor immediately starts labeling it ("alarm response," "attachment wound") and wants to turn it into data, which both distracts me and makes me quietly furious at myself for still reacting this way. I'm shaky and a little on the verge of tears; could you guide me with a slow counted breath or another anchor so I can stay here without my brain hijacking it into analysis?


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the heat and that sharp shame are still showing up, and the editor's trying to turn it into data again. 

Notice what happens when you count the breath – *one*... the heat is still there, but you're not trying to change it, just noticing it. *two*... the shame is still sharp, but you're holding onto the anchor in your heels. *three*... the editor's still there, but you're not trying to make sense of it, just noticing it too.

Patient: When you counted, the shame didn’t soften — it honed into this hot, humiliating verdict that I’m failing, and I feel suddenly small and furious at myself for being vulnerable. My instinct is to turn it into a tidy narrative about attachment and coping, but right now there’s just a tightness, shallow breaths, and a prickly heat behind my eyes. I’m shaky and close to crying; can we slow and do another slow, counted breath together so I can stay with this without my brain immediately hijacking it into analysis?


--- Turn 14 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 14]: [System Note: You are suddenly feeling very tired and emotionally drained. The conversation feels like a huge effort. Let this weariness show in your next response, which should be shorter and have lower energy than before. Do not explicitly say 'I am tired,' but embody it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like the shame's still there, even when you count – it's not softening, but it's not getting lost either. 

Let's try another slow breath, just for a moment. *one*... the tightness is still there, the breath is still shallow... *two*... the heat's still behind your eyes... *three*... the smallness is still there, but it doesn't have to be true. *four*... you can just notice it all – the tightness, the heat, the smallness – without trying to change it.

Patient: Yeah. The tightness is still there, the heat behind my eyes, and that humiliating little verdict — "you're failing" — is loud and bitter. My reflex is to turn it into a tidy case formulation, but right now that feels like more effort than I have; it's just... draining. Can we do another slow breath together and stay with it a bit longer? I'm shaky.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the effort of trying to change it feels like too much right now. 

Let's just notice what happens when you breathe into the tightness – *one*... the heat is still there, the smallness is still there... *two*... the bitter voice is still there, but it's not in charge. *three*... you can just hold onto that anchor in your heels, even if it feels like it's not enough. *four*... *five*... *six*... just notice it all, without trying to fix it.

Patient: Okay... it's still this hot, humiliating pressure — like a verdict that I'm failing — and it's making my head kind of foggy. I don't have the energy to make it into a neat case right now. Can we do one more slow counted breath together and keep the anchor in my heels? I need you to keep guiding me so I don't slip back into explaining it away.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fog is coming in – that's okay. 

Let's just focus on the anchor – *one*... your feet are on the ground... *two*... the weight is still there, even if it feels like it's floating... *three*... the fog is coming in, but you're holding onto that heel... *four*... *five*... *six*... just notice the fog, not trying to push it away.

Patient: Yeah... my heels are holding but the fog's thicker and that humiliating verdict — "you're failing" — is still loud. Turning this into a meta‑cognitive formulation feels like too much effort right now, so can we do another slow counted breath together and keep the anchor steady? I need you to keep guiding me.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fog is getting thicker – that's okay. 

Let's just stay with the anchor – *one*... your feet are still on the ground... *two*... the weight is still there, even if it feels like it's floating... *three*... the fog is still coming in, but you're holding onto that heel... *four*... *five*... *six*... notice the fog, but also notice the breath – it's still shallow, but it's still there.

Patient: Yeah... the anchor's holding but the fog's thicker and that humiliating verdict — "you're failing" — is loud and hot, with this prickly, wordless frustration at myself that makes me want to disappear. I can map it to old patterns if I try, but I don't have the energy to intellectualize it right now. Can we do another slow counted breath together and stay with this?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fog is really thick now – that's okay. 

Let's just focus on the anchor – *one*... your feet are still on the ground... *two*... the weight is still there... *three*... the fog is still coming in, but you're holding onto that heel... *four*... *five*... *six*... notice the fog, the weight, the frustration – but don't try to make sense of it. Just notice it, right where it is.

Patient: Okay... my heels are holding but the fog's thick and that humiliating verdict — "you're failing" — is hot and loud in my chest. I don't have the energy to turn it into a neat story right now; it just feels small and raw and I want to look away. Can we do another slow counted breath together, and maybe a gentle cue to notice where the shame sits in my body? I need you to keep guiding me.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fog is really heavy now – that's okay. 

Let's just stay with the anchor – *one*... your feet are still on the ground... *two*... notice the weight is still there... *three*... and now, let's notice the *hotness* in your chest... *four*... *five*... *six*... where does that hotness feel like it's sitting – right here, in your chest... *seven*... *eight*... *nine*... just notice it, not trying to move it.

Patient: Okay... the hotness is sitting low behind my sternum, like a burning lump that shoots up to my throat and presses behind my eyes. The verdict "you're failing" is loud and there's this prickly shame and small, furious frustration underneath it that makes me want to shrink away. I don't have the energy to turn it into a tidy explanation right now — can we do another slow counted breath together, and maybe you can prompt me to name one small, kind thing I can hold onto while we stay with this?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that burning lump is really intense – that's okay. 

Let's just focus on the anchor – *one*... your feet are still on the ground... *two*... notice the weight is still there... *three*... and now, let's notice the *prickly* feeling underneath the shame – what's that feeling like, exactly? *four*... *five*... *six*... where does it sit in your body?

Patient: It's a prickly, almost needle‑like heat under my sternum that shoots up to my throat and sits between my shoulder blades, with a sour knot in my stomach — physically small but loud. I can describe it clinically as "visceral constriction" and trace it to that old, humiliating verdict of failure, but I don't have the energy to turn it into another tidy formulation right now. Could you guide one slow breath with me, and then prompt me to name one small, kind thing I can hold onto while we stay with this?


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that visceral constriction is really showing up – that's okay. 

Let's just take one slow breath together – *inhale*... *hold*... *exhale*... notice how your body feels right now, with that burning lump and the sour knot in your stomach... *seven*... *eight*... *nine*... 

Now, I want to ask you to name *one* small, kind thing you can hold onto while we stay with this – not to make it go away, but just to notice it. What *is* one tiny thing you can notice about yourself, even with all this pain and discomfort?

Patient: Maybe the small kind thing is that my heels are holding me — that little steadiness under my feet — and that I'm still breathing, even if it's shallow. It feels embarrassingly inadequate next to the loud "you're failing" verdict, but it's a tether; can we do one slow breath together and stay with that?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that small kindness matters to you – even if it feels inadequate right now. 

Let's just stay with that *one* small thing – your heels holding you – *one*... *two*... *three*... notice how it feels to be connected to that steady ground, even if it's not changing the pain or the shame. *four*... *five*... *six*... *seven*...

Patient: Okay... I can feel the anchor in my heels — it's oddly steady, even as that hot, humiliating verdict pulses low in my chest and makes me feel small and quietly furious. I don't have the energy to turn this into another neat case right now; it's just oppressive. Can we keep doing another slow breath together? I need you to keep guiding me.


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're holding onto that steady ground, even when the pain and shame are still there – that's a big step. 

Let's just take another slow breath together – *inhale*... *hold*... *exhale*... notice how your body feels right now, with that anchor in your heels and the verdict still there... *eight*... *nine*... *ten*... 

I want to ask you to notice *not* trying to change that verdict – not trying to make it go away, not trying to change your thoughts about it. Just noticing *it* being there, right where it is.

Patient: Okay. I can notice the verdict — "you're failing" — just sitting there, hot and loud, and I'm trying not to push it away. My brain already wants to turn it into causes and patterns, but that feels like too much right now; there's this sour, shrinking shame and a prickly anger under it that makes me want to disappear. Can we do another slow breath together and keep the anchor in my heels? I need you to keep guiding me.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing the verdict without trying to push it away – that's a small step. 

Let's just take another slow breath together – *inhale*... *hold*... *exhale*... notice how your body feels right now, with that anchor in your heels and the verdict still there, hot and loud... *eleven*... *twelve*... *thirteen*... 

Notice what happens when you don't try to change the verdict – what happens to that shrinking shame and that anger. Is there still a tightness or a heaviness in your chest, or has that shifted in some small way?

Patient: It's still there — the tightness and heaviness haven't vanished, but something's shifted: the shame feels more pinpointed now, a hot knot low in my chest, and the anger's more of a dull thrum behind it instead of a sudden spike. That narrowing actually makes it a little less swallowing and a bit more... tolerable to notice, though I'm shaky and my brain keeps wanting to taxonomize it. Can we do another slow breath together and then maybe you can prompt me to name one small fact that counters that verdict for a moment?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you've noticed a small shift in the tightness and heaviness – that's a great finding. 

Let's just take another slow breath together – *inhale*... *hold*... *exhale*... notice how your body feels right now, with that anchor in your heels and the knot still there... *fourteen*... *fifteen*... *sixteen*... 

Now, I want to ask you to notice *one* small fact that's true about you right now, even with that knot and that thrum – not to make it change the knot, but just to notice it. What's one tiny thing that you can see or sense about yourself, right here, in this moment?

Patient: One small fact: my heels are pressing into the floor and my breath is shallow but moving — a tiny somatic anchor I can actually feel. I'm shaky and kind of spent; can we do another slow guided breath together so I don't drift back into explaining it away?
