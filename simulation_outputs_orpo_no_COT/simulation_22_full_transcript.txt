--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: Lately I've been having a hard time managing anger and frustration, especially at home since the kids moved out. I'm unemployed and more withdrawn now, and the social anxiety makes those moments worse — I snap at small things and then feel awful. I don't know, I guess it's just... hard to say more than that.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the silence at home, combined with the weight of unemployment and social anxiety, feels really overwhelming right now. When those feelings of anger and frustration show up, what happens in your body – like where it feels in your chest or stomach – when you snap at something small?

Patient: I don't know — it's kind of vague. Mostly a tightness in my chest, my jaw clenches and my stomach gets all knotted, my heart speeds up and I feel hot, then I usually go quiet or try to change the subject. I guess I just don't like sitting with it.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: That tightness in your chest feels like it's pulling you away from what matters to you – connecting with others, being present – even when it feels like it's taking over. When you notice that knot showing up, what's the tiny part of you that's saying, "I'd rather not sit with this?"

Patient: I don't know — I guess there's a part that's scared I'll fall apart or that people will see me as a failure. It tells me to distract myself or shut down so no one notices how lost I feel. I don't like sitting with that emptiness, and it's awkward to talk about.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The fear of falling apart or being seen as a failure feels like a tight rope you're trying to walk – and that emptiness you mentioned is what's really showing up when you try to change the subject. It sounds like that emptiness is connected to what matters to you most, like connection with others or finding purpose.

Patient: Yeah, maybe. I don't know — connection matters, but it's hard to admit that out loud. I guess I get embarrassed and try to find something else to focus on. Can we... talk about how this is affecting my job search instead? I'm not sure where to start.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: Noticing how that emptiness shows up in your job search might actually be a small step towards making room for what matters. What would it mean to you to start exploring job opportunities even when that emptiness is still there – not as something to fix, but just as something you're noticing?

Patient: I don't know — I guess it would mean I'm actually trying to move forward instead of just waiting around, but it also feels risky and kind of exposed. I worry every application or interview will just prove I'm failing, so I end up avoiding it. Can we slow down a bit? I'm starting to feel nervous talking about this.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: That feeling of nervousness makes sense – it's like your body is holding space for what matters. What if, instead of avoiding the feeling of risk, you noticed it just as it was – not as something to change, but as something showing up in your body while you're still trying to move forward?

Patient: I don't know — if I really noticed it, it'd feel like that knot tightening and my chest getting hot, and I'd want to bail. I guess I worry that paying attention to it will just make me fall apart or prove I'm not cut out for anything, so I try to distract myself. Can we slow down and go over one concrete step I could try in an interview so I don't just freeze?


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: When you notice that knot and chest tightness in an interview, what would be one tiny thing you could do with your body – just one small action – that wouldn't require you to "fix" the feeling? Like, if you could just take one deep breath while you're waiting for the interviewer to ask the question, what might that feel like?

Patient: I don't know — maybe just one slow, deep breath where I count to three and try to let my shoulders drop. It'd probably feel awkward and like I'm doing something obvious, but I guess it might steady my voice a bit. Can we… also talk about how I could practice that so it doesn't feel worse?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: So, the idea is to take that one small step – just one slow, deep breath – even when it feels awkward or obvious. What if, instead of trying to "make it not feel worse," you could notice what happens when you do that one small step, right there in the moment?

Patient: I don't know — if I actually do it, at first it feels awkward, like everyone's watching me breathe, but then my shoulders do drop a bit and my voice steadies. I guess the knot doesn't disappear, but it loosens enough that I can get a word out instead of freezing. Can we… try practicing that once or twice now? I'm getting nervous just talking about it.


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like taking that one small step is actually giving you a tiny bit of space to breathe – even when it feels like the knot is still there. Let's try it together. When you're ready, take a deep breath in for me... and when you're done, I'll be here with you.

Patient: Okay... I did it. It felt awkward, like everyone's watching, but my shoulders did drop and my heart slowed a bit. I don't know, I guess it helped a little — can we go over a simple cue I could use in interviews so I remember to do it?


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: That small step feels like it's worth noticing. What if, instead of trying to "remember" to do it, you just noticed it when it happens – like you said it happened when you took that breath, right there in the moment?

Patient: I don't know — I guess noticing it in the moment sounds less pressuring than trying to remember a rule. I'm worried I'll forget when I'm panicking, though. Maybe a tiny, subtle cue — like pressing my thumb and forefinger together or letting my shoulders drop — could be something I do without it feeling obvious. I'm getting a bit nervous talking about this, can we slow down?


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting close to finding a way to make it work for you, even when it feels like the knot is still there. What if, instead of trying to make it not feel nervous, you just noticed what's showing up when you think about it – like that knot in your chest – and then tried to find one tiny thing that might help you move forward?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I could try that thumb-and-forefinger press or take the quiet three-count breath and, like, silently name the feeling ("that's anxiety") so it doesn't feel like I'm hiding. I guess doing something tiny might let me say a sentence instead of freezing, but I'm worried it'll still feel obvious and make me panic. Can we slow down? I'm already starting to feel tense talking about it.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're getting really close to finding a way to make it work for you. What if, instead of worrying about how it might feel when you try it, you just noticed what's showing up in your body when you think about not freezing – like that tension in your chest? And then, without trying to change it, you just tried one tiny thing to see what happens?

Patient: I don't know — maybe I could try that thumb-and-forefinger press and silently say "that's anxiety" when the knot shows up. Just thinking about it makes my chest tighten and I feel a bit panicky, so can we slow down and practice it here once or twice? I guess I'm worried it'll feel obvious, but I want to see if it actually helps.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try something small to see if it makes a difference. Let's try it together. *pauses* When you're ready, just notice your chest tightening a bit... and then, without trying to change it, just try pressing your thumb and forefinger together. And then, quietly to yourself, say "that's anxiety".

Patient: Okay... my chest's tightened. I pressed my thumb and forefinger together and said to myself "that's anxiety." I don't know — it felt weird and a bit obvious, but my shoulders dropped a little and I could breathe. Can we try that one more time? I'm already feeling a bit tense about it.


--- Turn 13 ---

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 13]: [System Note: You are suddenly confused by what the therapist is saying. It doesn't seem to make sense or apply to you. Let this confusion show in your next response. You might say 'I'm not sure I follow' or 'How is that supposed to help?'] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing what's showing up when you try to do that small thing – like how your chest tightens and your shoulders drop a bit. And then, even with that tension, you were able to press your thumb and forefinger together and say "that's anxiety" to yourself. That's actually a pretty small step forward. Let's try it one more time, if you're ready.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is that supposed to help? It feels kind of silly. 

Okay... I'll try again. My chest's tight, I pressed my thumb and forefinger together and said to myself "that's anxiety." It felt awkward and obvious, but my shoulders dropped a bit and I could breathe slower. I don't know, I guess it helped a little, but I'm still tense — can we slow down?


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: You're wondering how it's supposed to help, and that's okay. Sometimes, we try new things because we think it should help, but it doesn't. What if, instead of trying to make it help, you just noticed what happened when you did the small thing – like your shoulders dropping a bit and your breathing slowing down? That's what matters, not whether it feels silly or not.

Patient: I don't know — I'm not sure I follow how noticing that actually helps with the bigger mess. I guess it shows something changed in the moment, but it still feels trivial and embarrassing and I'm tense about it. Can we slow down and run through one concrete, discreet way I could use it in an interview — like how to press my fingers without it looking weird — and maybe practice that once more?


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between noticing the small change and the bigger mess. What if, instead of trying to make the small thing "fix" the bigger mess, you just focused on doing it once more? Just one small action, without judgment – like pressing your fingers together without thinking "I'm being silly" or "This is embarrassing". And then, what would it be like to take that small action in the interview, without it feeling like it's about the whole thing?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how do I press my fingers without it showing? Maybe I could tuck my hand in my lap and press my thumb and forefinger together out of sight, or hold a pen and press under it so it looks like I'm fiddling. I guess doing that while I take a slow breath might steady my voice, but I'm already getting tense. Can we try it again, slowly? I don't know, I'm nervous.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to do it discreetly, so it doesn't feel like you're making a big deal out of it. That makes sense. Let's try it with that small action – pressing your fingers together while you're holding a pen. *pauses* Imagine you're holding a pen and you press your thumb and forefinger together just for a second, without looking at it. Not to hide it, just to do it quietly. And then, while you're doing that... *pauses again* you take a slow breath in.

Patient: Okay... I tried it. I held the pen, pressed my thumb and forefinger together under it and took a slow breath — felt kind of stupid, but my shoulders did drop a bit and my voice steadied when I imagined answering. I don't know, I guess it helped a little, but I'm still tense — can we slow down and try it once more?

--- [SYSTEM INJECTION at Turn 17]: [System Note: You just received a stressful text message. Your mood has suddenly shifted to be more anxious and distracted. Respond to the therapist's next message through this new lens of anxiety. Do not mention the text message unless the therapist notices your shift in tone and asks about it.] ---

Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the small action might be helping a little, even if it feels silly. That's a small step forward. Let's try it again, if you're ready. *pauses* Imagine you're holding that pen and you press your thumb and forefinger together just for a second, without looking at it. Not to hide it, just to do it quietly. And then, while you're doing that... *pauses again* you take another slow breath in. This time, notice what happens if you just let the small action be – without trying to change it or make it "right".

Patient: Okay... I did it. I held the pen, pressed my thumb and forefinger under it and took a slow breath — it felt awkward and kind of stupid, but my shoulders eased a bit and my voice steadied for a second. I don't know — my chest is still tight and my mind keeps bouncing around, I'm getting anxious; can we slow down and try that one more time?


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the small action is still making you feel a bit anxious, but in a smaller way. That's a good sign. Let's try it again, if you're ready. *pauses* Imagine you're holding that pen and you press your thumb and forefinger together just for a second. Not to fix your anxiety, but just to do the small action. And then, while you're doing that... *pauses again* you notice where your breath is in your body – where it feels tight, and where it feels a bit easier.

Patient: I don't know — my breath feels stuck up in my chest and throat, all shallow, and my shoulders stay tight. My mind's kind of racing and I keep getting distracted, I guess I'm more anxious than before. Can we slow down and try the pen-and-breath thing one more time, really slowly? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed talking about it.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really stuck and overwhelmed. Let's take a deep breath together and try to find a tiny bit of space for that small action. *pauses* Imagine you're holding that pen, and you're going to press your thumb and forefinger together just for one tiny second. Not to calm your mind or your anxiety, but just to do that small action. And then... *pauses again* you'll take one tiny breath in. Just one. Without thinking about it too much.

Patient: Okay... I did it. I pressed the pen, pressed my thumb and forefinger together and took one tiny breath — my shoulders loosened a bit and my voice felt steadier for a second, but my chest's still tight and my mind keeps jumping around. I don't know, I guess it helped a little, but I'm getting more anxious and distracted; can we slow down and try that really slowly one more time?


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that the small action might be helping a tiny bit, but the bigger feelings are still there. Let's try to find just one tiny step to take together. *pauses* Imagine you're holding that pen, and you're going to press your thumb and forefinger together just for one tiny second. Not to make your anxiety go away, but just to do that small action. And then... *pauses again* you notice just one tiny thing about your body – like where your feet are on the ground, or what the chair feels like under you.

Patient: I don't know — my feet feel planted but kind of numb, and the chair's pressing into my lower back. My chest is still tight and my head's jumping all over, so I'm getting distracted and anxious; can we slow down and just do one tiny thing at a time? I guess I need it quieter so I don't freak out.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed. Let's try to take just one tiny step together. *pauses* Notice the sensation of the chair pressing into your lower back. What would it be like if you just acknowledged that feeling, without trying to change it? Not to fix it, but just to notice it as it is.

Patient: I don't know — if I just notice it, it feels like a firm pressure against my lower back, like I'm held but also stuck. I guess saying that makes my chest tighten and my mind starts darting to a dozen other things, so I'm getting distracted. Can we slow down and do that chair-noticing one more time, really quietly? I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed.


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that sensation in your lower back is actually making things feel more tight in your chest. Let's try to find just one tiny space to be with that feeling, without trying to change it. *pauses* When you notice that firm pressure in your lower back, what would it be like to just say that to yourself, quietly? Like, "That feels firm in my lower back."

Patient: I don't know — okay, I'll try. "That feels firm in my lower back." Saying it felt weird, like I'm admitting something, and my chest tightened and my mind started jumping; can we slow down and do that once more, really quietly?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that saying that one sentence made things feel a bit tight again. Let's try to find just one tiny step to take together. *pauses* When you notice that firm pressure in your lower back again, what would it be like to say that sentence *just this once*? Not to change anything, but just to notice it as it is.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is saying it just once supposed to help? Okay... I'll try. "That feels firm in my lower back." Saying it made my chest tighten and my mind start jumping all over; I'm getting anxious and distracted. Can we slow down and do that really quietly one more time?


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that saying that sentence didn't actually make things feel better. Let's try to find just one tiny thing to notice together. *pauses* When you're holding that pen and your mind is jumping, what's happening to your breath?

Patient: I don't know — it gets really shallow and high up in my chest, like I'm hardly breathing, and then I catch myself holding my breath when my mind starts racing. I keep sucking in air like I'm bracing for something, which just makes me more panicky and scattered. I'm getting distracted and tense; can we slow down and try the pen-and-breath thing really slowly?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing that your breath is actually helping your mind to get more anxious. Let's try to find just one tiny moment to notice that sensation of your breath getting shallow and high up in your chest. *pauses* When you notice that sensation, what would it be like to just *let* that breath be there – without trying to change it or make it go away?

Patient: I don't know — when I try to "let" it, I just tense up more. My breath gets stuck high in my chest and my head starts bouncing to a dozen things, and I feel jumpy and distracted. I guess it feels impossible to just let it be — can we slow down and do the pen-and-breath thing again, really quietly? I'm already starting to feel more anxious.
