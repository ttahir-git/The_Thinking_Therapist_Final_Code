--- Turn 0 (Patient Initiation) ---
Patient: I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately — since my job situation went sideways my anxiety's been worse and I just don't have the motivation to do much, and that's bleeding into my relationship. I teach, I'm usually the upbeat, chatty type, but lately I find myself zoning out or snapping at my partner. I'm honestly skeptical this will help — how is talking about it supposed to actually change anything? I've tried things before and they didn't work, so I'm not sure where to start.


--- Turn 1 ---
Therapist: That skepticism feels like a weight holding you back. When you say "I'm not sure where to start," what might happen if you tried making space for just one small step – like taking a few deep breaths with me right now, before we explore the rest of this?

Patient: Alright, fine — I'll try a couple of deep breaths, though honestly, how is that supposed to help? (inhale) … (exhale). Okay, that actually eased the tightness a tiny bit, like the panic went down a notch, but it doesn't change that I still can't seem to get moving or stop snapping at my partner; breathing feels like a bandaid. I'm trying to see how this connects to the bigger stuff, but I'm struggling to make that link.


--- Turn 2 ---
Therapist: Notice what's left after that tiny easing – the feeling of "I still can't seem to get moving." When you say "breathing feels like a bandaid," what if, instead of trying to fix that feeling, you simply noticed it as a part of what's showing up for you right now?

Patient: Okay, I'll try to notice it — there's this tight, heavy feeling in my chest and a fog like my brain's on low power, and then this loop of "I should be doing something" that just turns into guilt and avoidance. Noticing it makes the panic a bit quieter, but it also feels helpless, like I'm just observing the stuckness without being able to move — how is that supposed to help me actually get up and stop snapping at my partner? I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.


--- Turn 3 ---
Therapist: The stuckness in your chest and brain fog are showing up as what matters most to you right now – being able to be with your partner without snapping. What would it be like to have just one moment – one conversation, one interaction – where you felt more connected to your partner, even if it felt imperfect?

Patient: I guess it would be something tiny — like sitting on the couch together, me actually listening without my mind racing, maybe laughing at something dumb instead of snapping. It feels almost foreign and makes me anxious because I don't know how to get from here to there. How is picturing that supposed to help — I’ve tried imagining better moments before and it just turns into guilt.


--- Turn 4 ---
Therapist: That's exactly right – imagining it doesn't fix the stuckness, and guilt shows up when you try to control it. What if, instead of trying to get to that moment, you noticed the tiny act of sitting together – what matters about that moment, not for the outcome, but just for the act of sitting with your partner?

Patient: What matters is feeling seen and not like a failure — being able to sit there and actually listen without my brain sprinting off to worst-case scenarios, so we can laugh about something stupid instead of me snapping. But honestly, when I try to be present my mind just jumps to lesson plans, bills, or how I messed up, and then I feel like I failed at being mindful — so how is focusing on the act of sitting supposed to actually change how I behave later? I need something that helps me get up and do the thing sometimes, not just notice that I'm stuck.


--- Turn 5 ---
Therapist: That's really clear – you want to move from noticing the stuckness to actually doing the thing that matters. Instead of focusing on "being mindful," what if you tried making room for that act of sitting together, just for a moment – not to change your mind, but so you could notice what matters most when you do get up and do it?

Patient: I mean, I can try making room for a minute, but how is that supposed to help me actually get up and not snap? Maybe I could set a 5-minute timer and tell my partner I'm going to sit and listen — sounds doable, but I've tried little tricks like that before and they usually just turn into zoning out or more guilt. If I fail at something this small, I just spiral back into feeling useless about the job stuff and everything else, so I don't know how to stop that.


--- Turn 6 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to make the small step feel less vulnerable, so you can actually take it. When you think about setting that timer, what matters most to you about it – is it just about showing up, or is it about avoiding the feeling of "failing" again?

Patient: Honestly, it's more about not failing — if I set a timer and then mess it up, it feels like proof I can't do anything and I spiral. Part of me does want to show up just to prove I can, but I'm terrified that even a tiny test will backfire. How is five minutes supposed to stop that whole "I'm useless" collapse when something goes wrong?


--- Turn 7 ---
Therapist: It sounds like the fear of failing is tied to feeling like you're not enough, and that's what's holding you back. When you say "even a tiny test will backfire," what might happen if you allowed that feeling to show up, just for a moment – not to change it, but to notice it while you still set that timer?

Patient: I guess if I let it show up I'd notice the shame and tightness instead of pretending it's nothing — maybe that would make it less contagious, like it's a feeling, not the whole truth. But I'm scared that paying attention to it will just feed the rumbling and then the five minutes will feel like proof I can't do it and I'll spiral. I could try setting the timer and saying out loud "I'm scared" while I sit, but honestly, how is that supposed to stop the collapse if it goes wrong?


--- Turn 8 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to make the timer work, even when you're afraid it won't. When you say "paying attention to it will just feed the rumbling," what matters most to you about sitting with that feeling – is it about fixing it, or is it about noticing what matters when the rumbling shows up?

Patient: I think it'd be more about noticing what matters when the rumbling shows up, not some quick fix — I want to see that the shame/tightness isn't the whole story. But I'm skeptical it won't just feed the spiral; how is noticing supposed to actually stop me from collapsing into "I'm useless" when it goes wrong? I don't know, I'm just... worried this will feel like another thing I fail at.


--- Turn 9 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to find a way to make noticing what matters matter, even when it feels like it's not enough. When you say "I don't know how to stop the collapse," what would it mean to you if, for just a moment, the collapsing didn't matter – not because it stopped, but because you noticed it anyway?

Patient: If the collapse didn't matter for a moment, it might feel like I could step back from the story that I'm completely broken — like the shame is just a wave, not the whole ocean, and that would give me a tiny bit of space to actually be with my partner. That small distance could let me catch myself before I snap, maybe laugh instead of railing at myself. But honestly, how is noticing supposed to stop the spiral once it starts? I'm willing to try noticing, but I'm nervous it'll just turn into another thing I fail at and then I’ll spiral harder.


--- Turn 10 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing might not be about stopping the spiral, but about holding onto something small while it's happening – that tiny distance, that small space to catch yourself. What if, instead of trying to stop the spiral, you tried holding onto that space, just for a moment – not to change it, but to see what matters when it's there?

Patient: Okay — I can try holding that tiny space for a minute, just noticing my chest and one thing that matters like feeling seen. But honestly, how is that supposed to keep me from collapsing into "I'm useless" if it goes wrong? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment.


--- Turn 11 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to protect yourself from feeling like you'll fail again, even as you try to hold onto that small space. What if, instead of bracing for the worst, you could just notice what happens when you try to hold onto that space – not to change it, but to see what matters when it's there, even if it feels like it's not enough?

Patient: Alright — I can try that: I'll hold that tiny space and notice what happens, focus on my chest and one thing that matters like feeling seen. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the spiral when it starts? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment and I don't know how to not let that swallow me.


--- Turn 12 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're really showing up with this – willing to try, bracing for the worst, but still willing to notice what matters. When you say "I don't know how to not let that swallow me," what might it be like to notice that feeling, not as something that's trying to stop you, but as something that's showing up – like a wave in the water, not the ocean itself?

Patient: I can try to see it as a wave — when I do, it loosens the "I'm useless" grip for a few seconds, like I get a tiny bit of distance. But then my brain usually turns that into "see, it didn't work" and it feels like the whole ocean again. How is noticing it as a wave actually supposed to stop that cascade into the spiral? I'm willing to try noticing, but I'm already bracing for it to just swallow me back up.


--- Turn 13 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the wave as a wave is creating some space for you, but then the brain is jumping in and turning it into "it didn't work." What if, instead of trying to stop the wave, you could just notice what happens when the brain says "it didn't work" – not to change it, but to see what matters when that thought shows up?

Patient: When my brain says "it didn't work," I get this hot shame and a hollow sinking in my gut — my chest tightens and I want to pull away or get defensive with my partner. My mind starts replaying every mistake and I get this urgent need to prove I'm okay, which just makes me snappier. How is noticing that supposed to stop the cascade? I can try to notice it now, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failure.


--- Turn 14 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that's not about stopping the cascade, but about showing up with the feeling of hot shame and the need to prove you're okay. When you say "I want to pull away or get defensive," what might it be like to notice that feeling, not as something that's trying to protect you, but as something that's showing up – like a strong current in the water?

Patient: Noticing it as a current makes it feel less like a trait and more like something that moves through me — I get a half-second to decide whether to pull away or stay. That little pause helps sometimes, but then I panic that staying calm means I'm weak or pretending, and my partner's look makes me snap anyway — how is that supposed to help when the moment is already unfolding? I'm willing to try noticing the current, but I'm bracing for it to just remind me how often I fail.


--- Turn 15 ---
Therapist: It sounds like that pause matters even when the moment feels like it's already unfolding – just for that one decision, to stay or pull away. When you say "my partner's look makes me snap anyway," what might it be like to notice that look, not as something that's triggering the snap, but as something that's showing up – like a presence in the water?

Patient: If I notice my partner's look as a presence, sometimes it reads to me like concern or wanting connection, and other times it reads like disappointment — and that second one makes my chest clamp up and I want to disappear. Noticing it gives me a tiny space to choose, but then I immediately panic that choosing to stay will look like I'm faking it or weak, and I snap to defend myself. How is noticing that look actually supposed to stop me from exploding in the moment? I'm willing to try noticing, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failure.


--- Turn 16 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that presence matters even when it's not what you want to see – like the concern or connection. When you say "I panic that choosing to stay will look like I'm faking it or weak," what might it be like to notice that thought, not as something that's trying to stop you, but as something that's showing up – like a shadow in the water?

Patient: Noticing it as a shadow might make it feel less like a fact about me and more like something passing — it gives a split-second to breathe and maybe not react. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from panicking when my partner looks disappointed? I'm getting frustrated and tired of these tiny tricks that feel pointless, but I can try noticing — I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failure.


--- Turn 17 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing that shadow matters even when it's not what you want to see – like the disappointment. When you say "I'm getting frustrated and tired of these tiny tricks that feel pointless," what might it be like to notice that frustration, not as something that's trying to stop you, but as something that's showing up – like a hum in the background?

Patient: Maybe if I think of it as a hum it feels less like an alarm and more like background noise — I can kind of keep doing things without it demanding to be fixed. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop me from snapping in the moment? I'm worn out from these tiny techniques that never stick, but okay — I can try noticing the hum and where it sits in my chest, though I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failure.


--- Turn 18 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the hum matters even when it's not what you want to see – like the snapping. When you say "I'm worn out from these tiny techniques that never stick," what might it be like to notice that weariness, not as something that's trying to stop you, but as something that's showing up – like a weight in your chest?

Patient: It really does feel like a lead weight over my lungs — everything slows and I want to disappear. Noticing it gives a sliver of space, but then the "that didn't work" thought hijacks everything and I sink back into shame and anger. I'm exhausted from tiny practices that never give me momentum — how is paying attention to a weight supposed to help me actually get up, stop snapping, or find stability with work? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failure.


--- Turn 19 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the weight matters even when it feels like it's not enough – like the "that didn't work" thought. When you say "I'm exhausted from tiny practices that never give me momentum," what might it be like to notice that exhaustion, not as something that's trying to stop you, but as something that's showing up – like a strong pull in your body?

Patient: Noticing the exhaustion as a strong pull feels like my limbs are weighted, like moving through thick water — even answering an email or getting out of bed becomes monumental. That heaviness makes me avoid things, which feeds the guilt and the "I'm useless" story about work and my relationship. I can try to notice it, but honestly — how is noticing a weight supposed to get me unstuck? I'm already bracing for this to feel like another failed experiment.


--- Turn 20 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the weight matters even when it feels like it's not enough – like the "I'm useless" story. When you say "I can try to notice it, but honestly — how is noticing a weight supposed to get me unstuck?" – what if, instead of trying to make noticing the weight "work" or "get you unstuck," you simply noticed it as it is – like the weight in your body, without trying to change it?

Patient: Okay — I'll try to notice it as it is, without trying to fix it. Right now it feels like a heavy, leaden pressure across my chest and a fog in my head, like moving through molasses. Noticing feels kinda passive though — how is that supposed to actually get me up or stop me snapping? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment.


--- Turn 21 ---
Therapist: It sounds like noticing the weight feels like a small step, but you're wondering if it's enough to actually make a difference. What if, instead of trying to "get up" or "stop snapping" with noticing, you simply allowed the weight to be there – not to change it, but to notice it as it is – and then *what* mattered to you about getting up or connecting with your partner?

Patient: What matters is feeling seen and not like a walking failure — being able to sit with my partner without my brain hijacking the moment, and rebuilding some sense of competence so the job stuff doesn't feel like it defines me. If I could get up and stay present even once without spiraling, it'd feel like proof I can still show up. But honestly, how is noticing the weight and saying this supposed to actually make me get up or stop snapping when the panic hits? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment — what would you have me actually do in the moment?


--- Turn 22 ---
Therapist: It sounds like you're trying to make noticing the weight and your values matter, but you're wondering how that's supposed to change what happens when the panic hits. What if, instead of trying to "make it work" or "get up," you simply *allowed the panic to be there* – not to change it, but to notice it as it is – while you *kept showing up with your values* – like feeling seen and connected with your partner?

Patient: Okay, I get the idea, but how is letting the panic be supposed to help me actually act differently instead of it taking over? Maybe I could try a tiny script — like saying to myself, "I'm anxious, I'm still here," and aim to stay present for two minutes — but I've tried little mantras before and they just turn into proof I failed. I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment; can you walk me through exactly what you'd have me do in that moment, step‑by‑step?


--- Turn 23 ---
Therapist: I'd be happy to walk you through what I'd have you do in that moment. When the panic hits and you feel like it's taking over, I'd want you to notice it exactly as it is – not to change it, but to see it as a sensation in your body. Then, I'd want you to make room for that sensation *right there*, in the present moment, *before* you try to change it.

Patient: Okay — I can try that: when panic hits I'll try to notice the sensation and make room for it before I do anything. But honestly, how is that supposed to help me actually not explode at my partner in the moment? Can we do a quick role‑play or you cue me through the exact words and steps to say to myself (and maybe to my partner) so I can practice it here? I'm already nervous this will feel like another failed experiment, but I'm willing to try if you walk me through it.


--- Turn 24 ---
Therapist: Let's do a quick role-play. Imagine you're in a moment where you feel like exploding at your partner, and you notice the panic rising up. I want you to notice the sensation in your body *before* you try to change it. Then, I want you to say this to yourself: "I'm feeling this panic, but I'm still here." 

Notice how that sounds, and how it feels to say it. Now, I want you to say that to your partner: "I'm feeling this panic, but I'm still here." 

Notice how that feels to say it out loud.

Patient: Okay — I said it to myself and it did dull the edge for a second, like a tiny pause. Saying it out loud to my partner felt exposed and weird, like I was begging for patience, and I half expected them to roll their eyes — which would just make me snap. How is that supposed to help if they respond badly? Can we role‑play what to say next if they look annoyed or dismissive so I don't just implode?


--- Turn 25 ---
Therapist: When you said it out loud to your partner, you noticed how it felt exposed and weird. That's okay. When you feel like they might respond badly, what if you *made room for that possibility* instead of trying to change it?

Patient: I can try making room for that possibility, but how is that supposed to help? If I "allow" them to be annoyed it just feels like I’m conceding and then shame swallows me — I need something concrete so I don't spiral. Can you give me exact words to say if they look annoyed or roll their eyes? I'm willing to try, but I'm already bracing for it to feel like another failed experiment.
