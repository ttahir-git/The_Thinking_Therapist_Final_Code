Patient: I'm an older manager and lately I've been overwhelmed by sadness and can't get motivated since that huge family fight. My head's like a fortune-telling machine — I keep picturing the worst: they'll cut me off, I'll lose the house, then I'll botch things at work and get fired, and it'll all spiral for sure. I get totally hooked on those stories and it's wrecking my relationship.

Therapist: Those stories feel like they're pulling you in, making it hard to see anything else. When that "fortune-telling machine" shows up, what happens if you could just notice it without getting pulled in by those worst-case pictures?

Patient: I want that to help, but when I try to just notice it, the doom-visions get louder and I can't seem to turn them off. It feels like stepping back would be denying reality — if I don't do something, they'll cut me off, I'll lose the house, I'll mess up at work and get fired, and it'll all collapse for sure. Honestly, "just notice" feels pointless to me because those outcomes are already certain in my head and I get stuck replaying them.

Therapist: Those outcomes feel like they're already happening, even if they're just thoughts. What matters isn't that you can "just notice" them; it's that you're willing to do something with this feeling of being stuck, even if it feels like it won't change anything.

Patient: I want to try, I really do, but when I try to act the fortune-telling kicks in — I picture them cutting me off, losing the house, then getting fired, and it's all inevitable, so I just freeze. I end up exhausted and can't take steps, and if you suggest other outcomes I can't buy them, they seem unrealistic. I'm trying to see how this connects to my problem, but I'm struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like the thought of "acting" feels like it would mean stepping into those worst-case scenarios anyway. When you're trying to make a step, like going to work or talking to them, what would it be like if you could make room for the possibility that it might not go exactly as planned?

Patient: I'm trying to imagine that, but it never sticks — the moment I try to make room for anything else the machine starts yelling the worst: if I go to work they'll notice I'm off, I'll get fired, then we lose the house, and my family will finally cut me out for good. If I try to call them I picture them slamming the phone and saying it's over, and that vision drowns everything else. It feels pointless to act because the doom-sequence feels inevitable, so I just freeze.

Therapist: The "pointless" feeling makes sense - it sounds like you're wondering why bother if those outcomes are already "guaranteed". When you notice that story showing up, what matters most to you in that moment - what matters more than "the machine yelling" or "the worst-case sequence"?

Patient: What matters most to me is not being abandoned — keeping my family, keeping the house, and not humiliating myself at work so I can still provide and be seen as competent. Even when the machine screams doom, I still want connection and safety; that's what nags at me under all the dread. But I keep thinking that's already lost, so I freeze and can't trust that anything could turn out okay.

Therapist: You're holding onto those things as a way to feel connected and safe, even if it feels like they're slipping away. What would it be like to hold onto that desire for connection and safety, even if it feels like the worst-case scenario is already "guaranteed"?

Patient: I want to hold that desire for connection and safety like a lifeline, but the minute I try it feels flimsy. The fortune-telling kicks in — if I let myself hope they'll call me needy, they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll botch things at work and be fired — so hope feels dangerous and I just freeze. I'm trying to picture holding that hope without everything collapsing, but I'm really struggling.

Therapist: It sounds like the hope itself feels like a threat, because it might mean not being good enough or not being strong enough. What if, instead of trying to hold onto hope as a lifeline, you could try to make room for it as a small possibility, like a tiny spark - not because you think it's going to save everything, but because it matters to you that you might feel connected and safe, even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: I want that tiny spark, but the moment I let it show up the fortune-telling machine starts yelling the worst — they'll call me needy and cut me off, we lose the house, I get humiliated at work. It makes hope feel dangerous, like I'm inviting the collapse, so I freeze and get distracted by those doom-visions. I do want to try though — can we slow down and pick one tiny, concrete thing I could do right now that might feel safe enough not to make the machine louder?

Therapist: Let's slow down and find that tiny thing. What would it take for you to do one small step right now, like making a cup of tea or taking a deep breath, that wouldn't make the fortune-telling machine louder? Not because it's going to solve everything, but because it matters that you're taking that one tiny step anyway?

Patient: Okay — I could try one tiny thing: maybe just sit up and take three slow breaths, or make a cup of tea and hold it for a minute. But the fortune-telling machine is already shouting that if I slow down they'll see I'm cracking, they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, and everything will spiral, so I'm scared doing this will just make it worse. Can we slow down and do the breaths together step-by-step so it doesn't feel like I'm pretending or inviting disaster?

Therapist: Let's do the breaths together, step by step. Just for this moment, can you notice what's happening in your body right now when you think about taking those three slow breaths? What's the first sensation you notice - the feeling in your chest, the tension in your shoulders, whatever it is?

Patient: My chest feels tight, like someone's sitting on it, and my shoulders climb up toward my ears. My stomach's all knotted and my breaths are quick and shallow, like I can't catch a full one. As soon as I notice it, the fortune-telling machine starts shouting the worst — they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired — and that makes it harder to even try the breaths. I do want to do them with you, though, so can we go really slowly?

Therapist: Let's go even slower. Can you notice the tightness in your chest, like someone's sitting on it, without trying to change it? Just notice it, like a sensation in your body - "My chest feels tight." And then, without adding anything else, notice how that makes you feel in your shoulders, like they're climbing up toward your ears.

Patient: My chest really does feel heavy, like someone's sitting on it, and my shoulders are up by my ears — my neck's tight too. The moment I name that, the fortune-telling machine starts yelling they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, and my breath just gets shallower. I don't know how to sit with the tightness without it turning into that whole disaster movie — can we keep going really slowly?

Therapist: Let's keep going. When you notice the tightness in your chest again, what happens if you didn't try to "fix" it - just notice it, like a sensation in your body? Not "I wish I could make it go away" or "I should be able to breathe better" - just "My chest feels tight." And when you notice the shoulders going up by your ears, what happens if you just let them be there, without trying to move them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is just noticing supposed to help? Every time I try that it flips into the movie in my head: they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and the doom-machine just gets louder, so it feels pointless to "just notice" and I'm kind of confused about how that helps. Can we slow down — I want to try, but I need you to walk me through it because my head won't stop narrating the worst.

Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together - just one breath in, and one breath out. When you notice that breath leaving your body, what happens to the thoughts in your head for just a moment - not trying to change them, just noticing them?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try to notice the out-breath, for a split second the machine quiets and I actually feel the tightness instead of the story. But that little gap scares me and then the fortune-teller starts yelling they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and everything collapses, so the silence never sticks. I want to keep doing the breath, though — can we go even slower and have you guide each inhale and exhale so I don't get pulled right back into the movie?

Therapist: Let's try that. I'll guide the breath with you. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... and as you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*... 

Now, breathe out slowly... *pause*... and as you breathe out, notice what happens to the thoughts in your head - what's there for just a moment, without trying to change it? *pause*...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help — when I breathed in there was a tiny pause, the machine actually quieted and I could feel the tightness instead of the story. Then it roared back: they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired — and the pause just vanished and I got yanked into the disaster movie. Can we keep doing it, really slowly, you guiding each inhale and exhale, because I want that quiet to last but I'm scared it'll disappear if we rush?

Therapist: Let's keep going. I'll guide the breath with you. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... and as you breathe in, notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*... 

Breathe in... *pause*... 

And when you're ready, breathe out slowly... *pause*... and as you breathe out, notice what happens to the thoughts in your head - what's there for just a moment, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — how is paying attention to the breath supposed to stop the doom-movie from roaring back? On the in-breath I feel the air down in my ribs and a little lift in my chest, but my shoulders still hitch up toward my ears. On the out-breath there's this tiny gap where the thoughts quiet, then the fortune-telling machine screams they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired and the pause is gone. Can we do another one even slower, like you count it with me so I don't get yanked straight back into that story?

Therapist: Let's try it even slower. I'll count the breaths with you. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1... 

Notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*... 2... 

Breathe in... *pause*... 3... 

And when you're ready, breathe out slowly... *pause*... 4... 

Notice what happens to the thoughts in your head - what's there for just a moment, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I notice the out-breath there's this tiny quiet, then a hot shame wells up, like I screwed up before and everyone can see I'm pathetic. Right after that the fortune-telling machine roars they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and I freeze so hard I can't even finish the breath. Can we count even slower, like you guiding each inhale and exhale one number at a time?

Therapist: Let's try it even slower. I'll count the breaths with you, one number at a time. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1... 

Notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*... 

Now, breathe out slowly... *pause*... 2...

Notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel?

Patient: When I breathe in I feel a tiny lift in my ribs but it’s like air hits a wall — my shoulders still hitch up and my neck tightens. Then this hot shame wells up, like I screwed up before and everyone can see I'm pathetic, and the fortune-telling machine roars they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired and I freeze. I'm anxious and keep drifting; can you count each inhale and exhale out loud, really slowly, one number at a time so I can try to stay with it?

Therapist: Let's try it, one breath at a time. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1... 

Notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*...

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how this is supposed to help, but on the out-breath there's a tiny loosening and then this hot shame wells up — like I screwed up and everyone can see I'm pathetic — and the fortune-telling machine immediately screams they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired. I get anxious and keep drifting right back into that movie and can't hold the quiet. Can you count each inhale and exhale out loud, really slowly, one number at a time so I can try to stay with it?

Therapist: I'm going to try to help you stay with it. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1... 

Notice the sensation of the air moving into your body - where does it feel in your chest, your shoulders, your head? *pause*...

*If you're still having trouble holding the quiet, I want to try something else. When you're ready, I'll ask you to notice what happens when you *try* to hold the quiet - what's the story that shows up when you try to stay with it?

Patient: When I try to hold the quiet my brain instantly launches the disaster script — they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired and everyone will see I'm a failure — and a hot shame floods my chest so I clamp up and freeze. I can't keep the pause; I'm jittery and keep drifting. Can you count me through another breath, really slowly, one number at a time?

Therapist: Let's try it, one breath at a time. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1...

Notice what happens to your body and thoughts for just this moment - what's there without trying to change it? 

*Before I count the next breath, I want to ask you something. What matters most to you about holding onto this quiet, even if it feels like it's not working right now?

Patient: What matters most is that the quiet gives me a tiny breathing space — a chance to feel like maybe I'm not already ruined, that I can still be connected and keep the house and not be humiliated at work. But the second I try to hold it, this hot shame wells up like that old screw-up is on display and the fortune-telling machine starts yelling they'll cut me off, we'll lose everything, I'll be exposed as a failure, so I panic and drift. I'm not sure I follow how this helps either, but I want that tiny pause — can you count me through another slow breath, one number at a time so I don't get yanked back?

Therapist: Let's try it again, one breath at a time. When you're ready, take a slow breath in... *pause*... 1...

Notice what happens to your body and thoughts for just this moment - what's there without trying to change it? 

*As you hold the quiet, what matters most to you - that tiny breathing space - is not about avoiding the shame or the fear. It's about noticing what's already there, even when it feels like it's not enough. Can you try to notice what's there right now, without trying to change it?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow how noticing helps — when I try there's a tiny ease in my ribs for a second, like a little space, then hot shame wells up and the fortune-telling machine screams they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and I freeze. I want that pause, but I keep drifting and getting jittery. Can you guide another slow breath with me, one count at a time, so I don't get yanked back into the movie?

*As we hold the quiet, I want to ask you something. What would it be like to let that tiny ease in your ribs be there, even if the shame and fear come back? Not to change them, but just to notice that they're there, while you're holding the space.

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — letting that tiny ease be there feels almost like a trap. For a beat my ribs loosen, then hot shame wells up and the fortune-telling machine screams they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and I can't keep the space. It feels impossible to "let" it without the whole disaster movie hijacking me; can you keep counting the breaths really slowly so I can try to hold that little ease, one number at a time?

*This time, I want you to notice the ease in your ribs while the shame and fear are still there. Just notice that they're there, like a presence in the room. Not trying to change them, just noticing them while you hold the space.

Patient: I'll try — when I notice that little ease in my ribs there's a tiny space, but the moment I name it a hot shame wells up and the fortune-telling machine starts yelling they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and everything collapses. It makes me clamp up and I can't keep the space; I'm kind of confused about how this helps and jittery. Can you keep counting each inhale and exhale really slowly, one number at a time, so I can try to notice the ease without getting yanked back?

Patient: I'm not sure I follow — when I try that I do feel a tiny ease in my ribs, like a little gap, but right next to it the hot shame and fear roar: they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired and everyone will see I'm a failure. I can catch that small space for a beat, then I clamp up and the doom-machine drags me back. Can you keep counting the breaths really slowly, one number at a time, so I can try to hold that little space without getting yanked right back into the movie?

Not "I have to make this space big" or "I have to fight this shame". Just notice that it's there, next to the shame, like a small part of the room.

Patient: I can catch that tiny space — a flicker in my ribs — but as soon as I name it hot shame rushes up and the fortune-telling machine screams they'll cut me off, we'll lose the house, I'll get fired, and I just freeze.
