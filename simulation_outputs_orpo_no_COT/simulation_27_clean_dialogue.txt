Patient: Hi, I'm an artist and since my recent move I've been overwhelmed with sadness and almost no motivation, and it's starting to hurt my relationship. I usually come off gregarious and optimistic, but lately I can't get into my studio and I'm easily distracted — it just feels stuck. I'm pretty skeptical about therapy, though — how is this supposed to help?

Therapist: It sounds like you're really struggling with this right now, and that can feel especially hard when you're used to being more outgoing. What's one small thing that would matter to you about having more motivation – even if it didn't completely go away – that's worth noticing when you're feeling stuck?

Patient: Maybe being able to sit in my studio and make one small mark on a canvas — even just for ten minutes — would matter, like proof I'm not completely done at my age. But honestly, how is that supposed to help? I've tried those tiny goals before and they never stick; I just get distracted or beat myself up about it.

Therapist: So what would it be like to notice that getting distracted or beating yourself up is happening when you try to make that small mark – not as a "failure" or a sign that you're not doing it "right," but just as something that shows up when you're trying to focus?

Patient: I guess if I could see the distractions and that inner critic as just things that pop up, it might stop them from feeling like proof I'm finished as an artist. But how is that supposed to help? Whenever I try to notice it, I either start spiraling into worse self-talk or I just drift off and nothing gets done.

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck between noticing the thoughts and letting them push you away. What if, instead of trying to "stop" them or change them, you could just notice the "I'm getting lost in this story" thought while you're making that small mark on the canvas – not to change it, but just to see it show up there?

Patient: I can kind of see that — maybe noticing the “I’m getting lost in this story” thought could make it less like a verdict on me. But honestly, when I try that I either spiral into worse self-talk or my attention just drifts away. How is just noticing supposed to stop the critic from taking over, and how would that actually help with the way my partner gets distant when I shut down? Give me one concrete, stupidly simple thing I could do in the moment that doesn’t feel like a therapy exercise.

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering how noticing the thought can actually make a difference in what happens when you're with your partner. What if, when you notice that "I'm getting lost in this story" thought while making that small mark, you just took a deep breath – not to change it, but just to notice it – *while* you made the mark on the canvas?

Patient: Okay, I can try taking a breath while making the mark, but honestly when I'm spiraling one breath doesn't stop the critic — I forget to breathe or my hand just drifts. How is that supposed to help with my partner getting distant when I shut down; would doing that in front of them actually change anything? Give me one ridiculously simple physical thing I can do in the moment that I won't overthink — like touching the canvas edge or humming once — something that feels real, not labeled "therapy."

Therapist: It sounds like you're wondering if there's anything that can help with your partner's distance when you're feeling overwhelmed. What if, when you notice the critic showing up while making the mark, you simply *moved your finger to the edge of the canvas* – just that small physical action – while taking a breath?

Patient: Alright, I can picture sliding my finger to the canvas edge while taking a breath — it's oddly specific, maybe that could ground me. But when I'm spiraling I either forget or my hand just drifts away; how is that supposed to help me actually keep working and not just feel like another failed trick? And doing that in front of my partner — would it really change how distant they get, or just look weird and make me feel more self-conscious? If that’s what you want me to try, give me one ultra-simple fallback for when I totally blank and do nothing.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about feeling like it's not working, and that it might even make things worse. What if, when you notice the critic showing up and your hand drifts away, you simply *picked up the brush again* – just to keep moving – without thinking about it too much?

Patient: Alright—I'll try to dumb it down and just pick the brush up again, I can see how the motion might break the dead air. But how is that supposed to help my partner not pull away when I shut down? If I totally blank and don't even move, give me one insanely simple fallback I can do that won't look weird—like tapping my knee once or pressing my thumb to my palm.

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for something that can help you show up even when you feel stuck. What if, when you notice the blankness, you simply *pressed your thumb to your palm* – just that small physical action – while holding the brush in your hand?

Patient: Alright — pressing my thumb to my palm sounds dumb-simple enough that I might not overthink it. But honestly, how is that supposed to stop the spiral or make my partner feel less shut out? I'm willing to try it, but I'm skeptical — can we do a quick practice now so I can feel it, and if I blank completely what's another fallback that won't look weird?

Therapist: It sounds like you're ready to give it a try. I'd like to do a quick exercise with you right now. When I say "go ahead," I want you to take the brush and press your thumb to your palm – just that small action – *while* you're holding the brush in your hand. Not to change anything, not to think about it... just to do it.

Patient: Okay — I'll try it, though I'm still skeptical it'll stop the spiral. Say "go ahead" when you want me to do it.

Therapist: When you're ready, just pick up the brush and *press your thumb to your palm* – that's it.

Patient: Okay — I picked up the brush and pressed my thumb to my palm like you said. It felt... kind of grounding for a second, like a tiny anchor, but then my hand twitched and I almost forgot I was doing it. If I totally blank and do nothing, what's another ultra-simple fallback I can do that won't look weird in front of my partner? And honestly, how is any of this supposed to change the way they pull away when I shut down?

Therapist: It sounds like that anchor felt small but useful. When your hand twitches and you forget, what's another tiny thing you could do with your hand that wouldn't require much attention? Just one small action.

Patient: I could do one slow roll of the brush between my thumb and forefinger — just a single, quiet rotation so it looks natural. But honestly, how is that supposed to make my partner feel less shut out when I go quiet? If that still fails and I blank, what's a last fallback that won't make me look odd?

Therapist: That slow roll sounds like a gentle way to keep moving with your hand. When you're feeling stuck and your partner pulls away, what matters most to you in that moment – not what you do with your hand, but what you'd like to hold onto with them?

Patient: Mostly I just want to feel seen and not like I’m a problem to be fixed — I want them to stay with me, not disappear when I go quiet. A small thing like them asking “Do you want me here?” or just touching my arm would make me feel less alone. But honestly, how is that supposed to help when their instinct is to pull away — won’t asking just scare them off more?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to connect with your partner even when you feel stuck and quiet. What if, instead of trying to make them stay with you, you could focus on what you're willing to stay with – even if it's just the feeling of being alone?

Patient: Maybe I could try staying with the feeling... but how is that supposed to stop my partner from pulling away? When I try to do that I just freeze — give me one tiny, normal-sounding thing I can say to them and one tiny thing I can do for myself in the moment that won't feel weird.

Therapist: When you freeze, what if you could say to your partner: "I need a minute to breathe" – just those three words. And while you say that, what if you took one small step towards making your own cup of tea – just to notice the sensation of your feet on the ground?

Patient: Okay... "I need a minute to breathe" sounds small enough I might actually say it without making a scene. Making tea and noticing my feet feels doable too, in this fog. But what if I freeze and can't even say that — what's one silent, totally normal fallback I can do that won't look odd, like a light touch on their forearm? And honestly, how is any of this really going to stop them from backing away when I shut down?

Therapist: When you freeze and can't say it, what if you could just make that light touch on their forearm – *just the touch of your finger on their skin* – without thinking about it too much. And as for stopping them from backing away, what if the goal isn't to "stop" them, but to create a tiny space for yourself to breathe, so you can be with them even when you're not feeling okay?

Patient: Okay — I could try the light touch, though my energy's thin and even that feels like an effort. How is that supposed to make them stay instead of scaring them off? If the touch feels wrong, what's one totally invisible fallback I can do — like pressing my thumb into my palm or shifting my weight — that won't look odd?

Therapist: When the touch feels like an effort, what if you could just let it be there, without trying to make it "right" – *just the touch, no matter how thin or awkward it feels*. And as for staying instead of scaring them off, what if it's not about what they do, but about what you're willing to be with them when you're not okay – even if it's just for a moment?

Patient: Okay — I can try to let the touch just be there without trying to make it right, even if it feels thin. But there's this old failure that flares up and makes me feel small and useless, so I’ll fall back to pressing my thumb into my palm or shifting my weight if it feels off. How is that supposed to make them stay? I don't know — I’m worn out, but I’ll try it.

Therapist: It sounds like you're willing to try, even when it feels like the old failure is still there. When that happens, what if you could just notice the feeling of smallness and uselessness, without trying to fix it – *just the sensation, not the story about it*. And when you press your thumb into your palm or shift your weight, what if you could just let that small action be there, too – not to make it "right," but just to be present?

Patient: I can try to notice the smallness without trying to fix it, but when that old failure crawls up I just shut down and everything feels heavier. Pressing my thumb or shifting my weight seems almost silly, but I'll try to let those tiny actions be there — though honestly, how is any of this supposed to make them stay?

Therapist: It sounds like you're stuck between noticing the smallness and shutting down. What if, instead of trying to make them stay, you could try to notice what happens when you let that shutdown happen – *what shows up in your body, what thoughts come up, what's already there when you're feeling heavy*. And when you press your thumb into your palm or shift your weight, what if you could just let that small action be there, too – not to make it "right," but just to be with that heavy feeling?

Patient: When I let the shutdown happen my chest goes heavy, my breath gets shallow, and everything kind of caves in — I literally get smaller in my body. That old failure creeps up and I flush with shame, so I either freeze or start replaying apologies in my head. Pressing my thumb is a tiny anchor and it helps a hair, but honestly, how is just sitting with the heaviness supposed to stop my partner from drifting? I'm willing to try noticing it, but I'm still pretty doubtful it'll make much difference.

Therapist: It sounds like when you let the shutdown happen, it feels like it's already too much to bear – the shame, the heaviness, the feeling of smallness. What if, instead of trying to make the heaviness go away, you could just notice what's already there – *the heaviness, the shame, the smallness* – and then make room for something else to be there too – *your breath, your feet on the ground, your willingness to try*. Not to stop your partner from drifting, but to create a tiny space for yourself to be with them, even when you're not okay.

Patient: Okay... I can try to notice the heaviness and my breath and my feet on the floor, and let those tiny actions be there without trying to fix anything. But how is that actually supposed to make them stay? When that old shame crawls up I just shrink and want to vanish—I'll try the thumb-to-palm or a light touch, but I'm worn thin and skeptical; what's one invisible, fail‑safe move I can do when I totally freeze that won't freak them out?

Therapist: It sounds like you're looking for a way to create space for connection even when you feel like shrinking away. What if, when you feel like you're going to vanish, you could just *let your eyes stay open* – not to look at your partner, not to try to fix anything, just to stay present with the feeling of being there?

Patient: I can try to keep my eyes open, but when that old shame creeps up it feels like everyone can see the part of me that failed — I just want to close and disappear. Maybe keeping them open could be a tiny way to stay present, but honestly how is that supposed to make them stick around instead of drifting? I'm worn out and it all still feels like one more thing to fail at.

Therapist: It sounds like you're still feeling like you're not enough, even when you try to stay present. What if, instead of trying to make your partner stay, you could try to make space for them to be with you *as you are*, not as someone who's "good enough"? Not as someone who's failed, but as someone who's showing up, even when it's hard.

Patient: Maybe I could try saying something like, "Could you stay with me for a minute?" — but the idea of asking makes me feel needy and that old shame slides right back in and I just shrink. How is that supposed to help without sounding like I'm demanding they fix me or scaring them off? If I can't even say those words, give me one ultra‑small, invisible fallback I can do in the moment that won't look odd and won't make me feel more ashamed.

Therapist: It sounds like you're worried about needing them to stay with you, and that makes you feel ashamed. What if, instead of trying to ask them to stay, you could *just notice the sound of your own voice* – not to say anything, just to notice that you have one – *just to notice that you're here*.

Patient: I can try to notice my voice, but when that shame creeps in my voice shrinks to almost nothing and I feel even smaller. How is just noticing my voice supposed to stop them from drifting? If I can't even do that, what's one invisible fallback I can do that won't make me feel more ashamed?

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your voice feels like it's still tied to that shame. What if, instead of trying to notice your voice, you could *just notice your feet on the ground* – not to do anything with them, just to notice they're there.

Patient: I can try to notice my feet on the floor, though my energy's so thin that everything feels muffled and that old shame pops up and makes me freeze — it’s like my body just folds in. How is noticing my feet actually supposed to keep my partner from drifting; I keep thinking it's just another thing I'll fail at. If that doesn't work, give me one invisible fallback — really tiny — that I can do without them noticing or me feeling more ashamed.

Therapist: It sounds like noticing your feet feels like it's not enough. What if, when that shame shows up, you could *just let your chest relax* – not to let it go, just to notice that it's not moving anymore.

Patient: Okay... I'll try to notice my chest — it already feels like a weight and makes me shrink down, which just makes everything harder to move. But how is that supposed to make them stay instead of drifting? If I freeze, my invisible fallback will be pressing my thumb into my palm and keeping my eyes a little open so I don't disappear.

Therapist: It sounds like you're getting closer to what you need – *keeping your thumb down and eyes open* – even if it's not perfect. What if, when that weight shows up in your chest, you could just *move your thumb down a little bit* – not to push it away, just to notice that it's still there, even if it feels heavy.

Patient: Okay... I'll try moving my thumb down a little — maybe it can be a tiny anchor for a second. But when that old failure crawls up I fold in and everything goes foggy, and I still don't see how this will make them stay — if my hand freezes, what's one ultra‑tiny, invisible fallback I can do that won't feel more humiliating? I'm worn thin, so please keep it ridiculously simple.

Therapist: It sounds like the weight is really strong. What if, when it feels like you're folding in, you could *just notice your breath moving in* – not to change it, just to notice that it's still happening, even if you're not feeling it very much.

Patient: I can try to notice the breath — it's barely there, like a thin thread, and it feels hard not to sink into that shame that makes me fold in. But honestly, how is that tiny noticing supposed to make them stay? If I totally blank, I'll fall back on the thumb‑to‑palm and keeping my eyes a little open so I don't vanish.
